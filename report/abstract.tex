%1 paragraph: main idea and a key finding \\
Genre classification and music recommendations are an important service of online music providers. Since manual genre classification is very time-consuming, especially with ever larger quantities of music available, an accurate classifier for music genres enhances the user experience of music providers and provides insight into themes that differentiate genres from each other. This paper proposes an extension of LDA to model topics over genres instead of documents, and shows that this extension outperforms regular LDA on classification tasks.
