1 paragraph: main idea and a key finding \\
Genre classification for music is increasingly important with many online music services around. Manual genre classification is very time-consuming, especially with the large quantities of music available. Thus, a tool that can accurately classify music into a genre would be an economically efficient way to enhance the user experience. This paper proposes an extension of LDA to model topics over genres instead of documents, and proposes that this may improve word-based classifiers.
