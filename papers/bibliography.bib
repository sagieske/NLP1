% Lyrics-based Analysis and Classification of Music
%This article uses disjunct training and test set wrt artists (artist
that is in the training set may not be in the test set) because 
apparently, lyrics predict artist more than genre [footnote 9]
%There is also a rhyme detection tool which might be good
to use, by Hirjee and Brown 2010. Also contains extensive
explanation of different features for classification
%Also, regressive image dictionary (Martindale, 1990) might be
useful to distinguish imagery in lyrics for classification
