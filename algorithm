1. Extract clean lyrics from lyrics files

2. Build vocabulary of all possible words

3. Randomly initialize Gibbs sampler

4. Repeat N times:

	Loop though documents:

		Loop though words:

			For each topic:

				Update the topic propability


5. Initialize genre topic distribution

6. Loop though documents:
	
	Initialize document topic distribution

		Loop trough words:

			Add topic propabilities to document topic distribution

		Add document topic distribution to genre topic distribution

7. Train learning algorithm (ie SVM) with genre topic distributions

8. When testing a lyric:

	- Clean lyric
	- Repeat N times:
		Loop trough words:
			For each topic:
				Update the topic propability
	- Determine the document topic propability
	- Feed document topic propability to learning algorithm, due to supervised learning the response will be the most likely genre of the lyric
