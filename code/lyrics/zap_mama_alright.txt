Song:

I'm thinking, i'm thinking about how our love started
i want to, i want to
i want to dream of it always
i've spent, i've spent all my night
dreaming, dreaming
dreaming of it anyway
you say it's over and it's nothing, no longer our story
why you say that to me like this, baby?
you say it's over
you promised me to be the one
let me enjoy it in my memory
i'm trying, i'm trying to get it on my brain
my love for you runs in my blood
i did everything, my love
but our love story stays in my brain
ohhh baby

it's all right
it's all right
it's all right

you say it's over
it's not anymore our story
why you did that to me baby?
i know it's over
it's not any longer how it started
just let me enjoy it in my memory
why, baby?
why, baby?
why?
why, baby?

it's all right
it's all right
it's all right
