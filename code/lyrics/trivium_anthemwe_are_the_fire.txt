Song:

Just when they thought you were through
You've burned their lies, now you're strengthened it's true
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those mother fuckers rot in their jealousy
They
Can't stand
That the worlds up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything
We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
The music connects, unites us more
Our masses strengthened, an unstoppable horde
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say
They
Can't stand
That the worlds up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those sons of b*****s rot in their jealousy
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say

We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
Fire!

Wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh wooo-oohh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeeeeeeeeah

We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
We are the fire
We sound the anthem
We are the fire
