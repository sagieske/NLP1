Song:

You know this language that we speak,
Is part german , latin and part greek
Celtic and arabic all in a heap,
Well amended by the people in the street
The Choctaw gave us the word "okay";
"vamose" is a word from Mexico way.
And all of this is a hint I suspect of what comes next.

Chorus:
I think that this whole world
Soon mama my whole wide world
Soon mama my whole world
Soon gonna be get mixed up.
Soon mama my whole world
Soon mama my whole wide world
Soon mama my whole world
Soon gonna be get mixed up.

I like Polish sausage, I like Spanish rice,
And pizza pie is also nice
Corn and beans from the Indians here
Washed down by German beer
Marco Polo traveled by camel and pony,
He brought to Italy, the first macaroni
And you and I as well we're able,
We put it all on the table

(Chorus)

There were no red-headed Irishmen
Before the Vikings landed in Ireland
How many Romans had dark curly hair
Before they brought slaves from Africa?
No race of man is completely pure,
Nor is anyone's mind, that's for sure
The winds mix the dust of every land,
And so will woman and man.

(Chorus)

This doesn't mean we will all be the same,
We'll have different faces and different names
Long live many different kinds of races
It's a difference of opinion that makes horse races
Just remember the rule about rules, brother
What could be right for one could be wrong for the other
And take a tip from La Belle France: "Viva la difference!"

(Chorus)
