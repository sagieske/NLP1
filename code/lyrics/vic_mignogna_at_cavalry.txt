Song:

(Oh... ooh...)
Years I've spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified
Knowing not it was for me he died
At Calvary

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary

[Refrain]
Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty

[Chorus]
At Calvary
At Calvary
I am not the same, by the power of the name
Given at Calvary
At Calvary
The payment for my fall, was completed once for all
At Calvary

(Ooooh... now I've given to Jesus... everything)
Now I've given to Jesus everything (Now I gladly have Him)
Now I gladly have Him as my King
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary (yeah)

[Refrain]
Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty (found liberty)

[Chorus]
At Calvary (yeah)
At Calvary (You saved me)
I am not the same, (no no) by the power of the name
That was given at Calvary (yeah)
At Calvary (hey yeah)
The payment for my fall, was completed once for all
At Calvary

Oh... I am falling
I am falling
Hallelujah

[Refrain]
Mercy there was great and grace was free (oh, it was free)
Pardon there was multiplied to me (there my soul)
There my burdened soul found liberty (found liberty)

[Chorus]
At Calvary (sing it to the Lord)
At Calvary (You saved me)
I am not the same, (no no no no) by the power of Your name
Given at Calvary (yeah yeah yeah)
At Calvary (You saved me)
The payment for my fall (my fall), was completed once for all
(At Calvary) At Calvary

Thank you, Lord...
Thank you, Lord...
