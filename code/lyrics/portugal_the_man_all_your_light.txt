Song:

I'm just the shadow of a bigger man
Glowing brighter with each year I am
I was standing on a mountain
Just looking down (on you on you)

It's like my daddy said
You gotta use your head (my body won't work for nobody but me, son)
Yeah, no one said that I aim to please

All your light can't save me
All your light all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come (my body won't work for nobody but me, son)

As a boy I had it figured out
There are things that you can't live without
But money, it's sad but true, would surely top that list
And your rules your rules, well they would not be missed

Well I became
Whole again
Cause no one said no one said no one said
There'd be times like these

I said all your light can't save me
All your light all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come

(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
Well, no one said there'd be times like these

I was licking flames, when I broke your reins
Still, no one said no one said no one said it'd be suicide

All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come

(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these

All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait
My time may come
