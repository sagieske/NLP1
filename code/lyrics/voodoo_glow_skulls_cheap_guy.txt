Song:

You say I'm your best friend. Well, you're not mine. Always complaining about
Money all the time. Why don't you grow up and listen to me. Money can't buy
Everything. Everytime we go out I have to pay. You might as well call me dad.
None of the girls will go out with you. Because you make them ride the bus.
Some people say you squeak when you walk. Penny pinching all the time.
Everything to you is one big price. That you're gonna have to pay. You don't
Have the money. According to you. When it's time to pay your way.
Someday at home you'll be alone. With no job and no friends.
