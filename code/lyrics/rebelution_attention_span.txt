Song:

Woah now now woahhh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

Who can this be, this stranger at my door?
Although I know I've seen her once before
Come on, why can't I remember your name now
But in a way it's best that I don't say:

[Chorus:]
"It's a pleasure to meet ya
Once again for the night
I can't promise my focus"
Is it me? Or is it my attention span?

Woah now now woahhh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

I see the way you stare at me oh girl
I like the way you sway your hair and twirl
God damn, why can't I remember your name now
But in a way it's best that I don't say
Chorus

Woah now now woahhh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh

Is this more than just routine?
Weigh it down on me
Give me more than just my needs
Weigh it down on me
And we're still riding high
And we're still riding high

I see the way you stare at me oh girl
I like the way you sway your hair and twirl
God damn, why can't I remember your name now
But in a way it's best that I don't say

Chorus

Woah now now woahhh
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh
