Song:

A change, A change has come over me
(Choir)... He changed my life and now I'm free

He washed away all my sins and he made me whole
He washed me white as snow
He changed my life complete and now I sit, I sit at his feet
To do what must be done I'll work and work until he comes

(Choir).... A wonderful change has come over me
A wonderful change has come over me

Yes he changed (changed)
My life complete (changed)
And now I sit (changed)
I sit at my savior's feet (I'm so glad he changed me)
To do (changed)
What must be done (changed)
I'm gonna work and work
Until my savior comes (I'm so glad he changed me)
I'm not what I want to be
Oh I'm not what I use to be
I'm not the same way thank God
Thank God (I'm so glad he changed me)
He changed my walk, (Change)
He changed my talk, (Changed)
He changed my life he even changed (Changed)
Changed my soul, I've come along way, in Jesus, I've come along way, in Christ, I've come along way, Thank God Thank God

A wonderful change has come over me
