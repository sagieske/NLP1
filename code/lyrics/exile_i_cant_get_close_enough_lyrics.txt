Song:

Anything, I would give anything
If I could only show you
How strong my passion is for you

But every time I've tried to tell you
I can't find the right words to say
No matter how hard I keep trying
I just haven't found a way

I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you
Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do
I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you
But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through

Everywhere, I would go everywhere
Right beside you, if that would prove my love for you
Wherever you lead, I would follow, it makes no difference, you see
I'd give anything to make you understand how much you mean to me

I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you
Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do
I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you
But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through

Oh, I can't get close enough, I can't get close enough to you
Just holding you tight, all night, doesn't seem to do
I can't get near enough, I can't get near enough of you
But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through
But you know that, it's a good kind of thing I'm going through

Got to get closer, near enough, near enough for you
(Oh, I've got to get closer)
Close enough, got to get closer, near enough, near enough
(Near enough for you)

Close enough, got to get closer
Near enough for you
Close enough, got to get closer
(Oh, I've got to get closer)
Near enough
(Near enough)
