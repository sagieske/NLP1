Song:

I am an antichrist, I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passerby
'cause I wanna be anarchy
No dogs body Anarchy for the you. K.
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
You'are future dream is a shopping scheme
Cause I wanna be anarchy In the city
How many ways to get what you want
I use the best I use the rest
I use the nemy I use anarchy
Cause
I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be
Is this the M. P. I. A. Or
Is this the you. D. A. Or
Is this the I. Are. A.
I thought it was the you. K.
Or just another country
Another council tenancy
I wanna be anarchy
Oh what a name
And I wanna be an anarchist
Get pissed
Destroy!
