Song:

This goes out to my homegirls
This goes out to my homies

[Verse 1:]
Baby girl, I know that you've been off track
You feel like taking one step forward, taking two back
No matter how hard you try, things always go bad
The thought of a better life, you'll never know that

You smile on the out, but inside you hurt
You say that you're fine, but you feel unsure
Try to replace the pain by saying false words
You see that girl in the mirror but don't know her

[Hook:]
But the tears can't wash away
All the fears you haven't faced
Baby girl, don't lose your faith
'Cause the storm don't last always

[Chorus:]
This goes out to my homegirls
Know it's hard to make it in this world
I know you try
And it feels like
Nothing goes right
But it'll be alright

This goes out to my homies
Tryna survive out in these streets
I know it's tough
Forced to grow up
Life is messed up
But keep ya head up

[Verse 2:]
Baby boy, the streets, it's all that you know
You dream of a higher place, but you stay low
And when you go home and mad and you're all alone
Wanna call out to your boys (but they're all gone)

You tell yourself (that you don't need)
No one else (but if only)
You would try (won't give no need)
Won't have to hide (what you're feeling)

[Hook:]
But the tears can't wash away
All the fears you haven't faced
Baby boy, don't lose your faith
'Cause the storm don't last always

[Chorus:]
This goes out to my homies
Tryna survive out in these streets
I know it's tough
Forced to grow up
Life is messed up
But keep ya head up

This goes out to my homegirls
Know it's hard to make it in this world
I know you try
And it feels like
Nothing goes right
But it'll be alright

[Bridge:]
Baby girl, keep your head up
Promise me you'll never give up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Baby boy, keep your head up
Promise me you'll never give up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
This goes out to my homegirls
Know it's hard to make it in this world
I know you try
And it feels like
Nothing goes right
But it'll be alright

This goes out to my homies
Tryna survive out in these streets
I know it's tough
Forced to grow up
Life is messed up
But keep ya head up
