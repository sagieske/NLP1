Song:

Smeared black ink... your face is ashen
And I'm barely listening to last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath 
Where I am
Where I am

I'll wear my badge... a vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my
Chest
That tells your new friends I am a visitor here... 
I am not permanent
And the only thing keeping me dry is 
Where I am (You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (A stranger with your door key explaining that I am just
Visiting)
Where I am (And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

D.C. sleeps alone tonight
D.C. sleeps alone tonight
Where I am (You seem so out of context in this gaudy apartment complex)
Where I am (A stranger with your door key explaining that I am just
Visiting)
Where I am (And I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving)
(Why I was the one worth leaving)

The district sleeps alone tonight after the bars turn out their lights
And leave the autos swerving into the loneliest evening
And I am finally seeing 
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
Why I was the one worth leaving
