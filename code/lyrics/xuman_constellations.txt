Song:

Here you can find
What you are stand back from your knees
You can see what to do
It's deliverance
Exceed explanations
Here silver melt of the due
Splendor of the sun
In the owners arms
You can be the one
To see
Constellations

Couse I will always be up here
Till the end of the times
Couse I will always be for sure
That you'll never be forgotten
(You will always be here)
