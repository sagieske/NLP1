Song:

Hidden beneath the ground,
Is the spring that feeds the creek,
Invisible as the wind,
That you feel upon your cheek.

And every breeze that whispers,
Reminds us constantly,
Sometimes what's real,
Is something you can't see,

Believe in all that can be,
A miracle starts whenever you dream,
Believe and sing from your heart,
You'll see your song will hold the key.

Waiting behind the clouds,
Is a sky that's always clear
And chasing away the doubts,
You watch the sun appear

It's shining to remind you,
As each new day begins.
There's always hope if you just let it in

Believe in all that can be
A miracle starts whenever you dream
Believe and sing from your heart you'll see
Your song will hold the key.

You can paint the stars,
You can touch the sky
Spread your wings and discover you can fly
Won't know until you try

Believe in all that can be
A miracle starts whenever you dream
Believe and sing from your heart you'll see
Your song will hold the key
Oohh,
Believe and dream what can be
Ask with your heart and you will receive
Believe the beauty is yours to see
Your song will hold the key...
Aahhhhh...
(When you) BELIEVE, BELIVE, When you believe
