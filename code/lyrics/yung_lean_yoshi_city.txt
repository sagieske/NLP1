[Hook:]
Golden city we [?] it down
Yoshi city we burn it down
I guess it's my turn now
Smoking loud I'm a lonely (clown/cloud)
I'm a lonely (clown/cloud), with my windows down
I'm a lonely, lonely, I'm a lonely, lonely [x2]

[Verse: 1]
Be the only hope I got left
Blessed with a success
F**k stress I'm gonna trust the best
I'm nervous that she's so upset
She don't want me, b***h I'm flustered
I'm an aristocrat without the progress
Roses all on her wedding dress, blood from her mouth, I'm a mess
Alien faces everywhere I go
Downtown b***h that's where I smoke
Got my heart next to my phone
Do or die? Stupid high
Lonely nights, finna sacrifice
F**k your life I need mine
I'll take yours and rewind
Walk in my shoes you'll see why
F**k your [?] don't reply
Sad boys b***h we world wide
Grey sweatshirt, L size
Wakizashi and grey Nikes
F**k norms, f**k a normal life
F**k norms I'll break em out
[?] that's what I said
Lean, lean, lean you got it in your head
Like a disease you know I spread, I can't sleep with out you on my bed
Yoshi city [?]
All me, I can't [?]
Sad boys, gonna burn it down
Windows down, face out
Squad out when we riding out
We riding out

[Hook x4]
