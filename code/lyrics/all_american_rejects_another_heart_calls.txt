Song:

Do you remember when we didn't care?
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there,

Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls,

I remember when we stole the night,
We lie awake but dreaming 'till the sun would wash the sky,

Just as soon as I see you,
Didn't I, didn't I tell you,
As deep as I need you,
You wanna leave it all,

What can I do?
Say it's true,
Or everything that matters breaks in two,
Say it's true,
I'll never ask for anyone but you,

Talk to me,
I'm throwing myself in front of you,
This could be the last mistake that I would ever want to do,
All I ever do is give,
It's time you see my point of view,

Just as soon as I see you,
Didn't I didn't I tell you,
As deep as I need you,
You want to leave it all,

What can I do?
Say it's true,
Or everything that matters breaks in two,
Say it's true,
I'll never ask for anyone but you,

I know you want to figure it out,
And God knows I do too,
What can I do?
Say It's true,
I'll never ask for anyone but you,

I'm sorry,
So what?
But you don't think I've said enough,
I'm sorry,
I don't care,
You were never there,

Just as soon as I see you,
Didn't I, didn't I tell you,
As deep as I need you,
You wanna leave it all,

What can I do?
Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true,
I'll never ask for anyone but you,

I know you want to figure it out,
And God knows I do too,
What can I do?
Say it's true,
I'll never ask for anyone but you,

Woah oh oh ohhh,

I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
