Song:

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a girl that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally.

Well, I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't ever tell
The movies are gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well.

Well, I hope you'll come to see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally.

--- Instrumental ---

We'll make a scene about a girl that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon her bended knees
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I got to do is act naturally.

Well, I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can't ever tell
The movies are gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well.

Well, I hope you'll come to see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally...
