Song:

V1) Blood is thicker than tears but hey, you don't have to be perfect just be your best
I'm am someone's daughter, made of earth and clay yet like the angels, nothing less
And in this one act tragic comedy
I've got to find myself a way to get myself free

Ch) I don't need no one to tell me east from west
I don't ever wanna settle for the second best

V2) 'Cause every time I turned around there was someone's disapproving frown inside the door
So I decided to live for myself, 'cause in the end nobody came worth living for
Because the fullest fields can feed a lot
But I could never give what I never got

Ch) I don't need no one to tell me east from west
I don't ever wanna settle for the second best

Bridge) Don't need nobody givin' me that good advice
Just a little tenderness would be so nice
As we watch the sun rise

V3) So I thanked them for helping me, I thanked them for I could see the false from real
The time had come, the bags were packed, the lines were cast and we were finally setting sail
I've got to hold on to these dreams I've found
'Cause they're the only thing that are keeping me above the ground

Ch) I don't need no one to tell me east from west
I don't ever wanna settle for the second best
