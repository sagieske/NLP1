Song:

How my thoughts
They spin me round
And how my thoughts
They let me down
And how my thoughts
They spin me round
And how my thoughts
They let me down

And how my dreams
They spin me round
And how my dreams
They let me down
And how my thoughts
They spin me round
And how my thoughts
They let me down

And then there's you
Then there's you
Then there's you
Then there's you

And how my love
It spins me round
And how my love
It's let me down
And how my thoughts
They spin me round
And how my thoughts
They let me down

And then there's you
Then there's you
Then there's you
Then there's you

You know that I know you well
I've written all myself if you can't tell
With a melody that climbs and then falls
Then falls
Then falls
Without you
Without you

How my days
They spin me round
And how today
Iit sets me down
And how my days
They spin me round
And how today
It sets me down alongside you
Alongside you
Alongside you
