Song:

Youre so impossible
Scream and moan it chills my soul
Don't wanna hear you got left behind
All those times you stayed up and cried
Its no lie
You did it to yourself
Like chewed up gum under my shelf
Don't look surprised
You must have know all along

Its just another love song
Another love song

Its never easy
Its not hard
When youve lost your mind
With you it's sleezy
Don't tell me your worries
Im sick, I'll leave you blind
Now the time has come
To leave this love that's left you dry
No need to work this out now
Cause you know there's no reason why

Its just another love song
Another love song

I never told you it would last forever
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it
By the time you read my letter
Baby, I'll be gone

Youre just another love song
Another love song
