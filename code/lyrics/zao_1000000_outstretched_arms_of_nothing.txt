Song:

Isolated.
Inside of everything.
Black hole sphere.
Balanced inside the eye.
Positive and negative chaos.
1, 000, 000 outstretched arms of nothing, whose fingers search for something...
And there is a prison in my mind.
Death is inside of us.
Reality changes around us.
As time unfolds us...
All eyes see what they want to and not what they need to.
All hearts are over before it begins.
Fate at the wheels of chance, the wheels of chance, the wheels of chance.
Lucidity is our bridge between life and the great unknown.
We cross without hesitation
