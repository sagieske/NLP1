Be Grateful
Be Grateful

God has not promised me sunshine
That's not the way it's going to be
But a little rain
Mixed with God's sunshine
A little pain
Makes me appreciate the good times

Be Grateful (Be Grateful)

God desires to feel your longing
Every pain that you feel
He feels them just like you
But he can't afford to let you feel only good
Then you can't appreciate the good times

Be Grateful (ooooooooooooooo)
Because there's someone else who's worse off than you
Be Grateful (oooooooooooooooo)
There's someone else who'd love to be in your shoes
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Cause it could be your family living in the streets
Be Grateful (Be Grateful
Imagine your children with no food to eat
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
There's never been a time when he didn't see you through
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Keep on praying and
Keep on believing for (it will be all right)


Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Because there's someone else who's worse off than you
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Because there's someone else who'd love to be in your shoes
For (it will be all right)

Be Grateful (Be Grateful) (2xs)
Its gonna be alright (2xs)
For it will be alright

Keep on believing (alright)
Keep on praying (alright)
Keep on trusting (alright)
Keep on praying (alright)
Keep on waiting (alright)
Keep on praying (alright)
Your blessing coming (alright)
Just keep on praying for (for it will be alright)

Be Grateful
