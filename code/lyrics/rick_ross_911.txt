Song:

God forgives... I don't
In other words, retaliation is a must!

[Hook:]
I bow my head, I pray to God
Survival of the fittest: help me hold my chopper lord!
If I die today, on the highway to heaven
Can I let the top down in my 911?

Financial fanatic, 400 bricks in my attic
400K in my baggage, ? Automatic
You can't stop a bullet, this one for the money
Secret indictments, sport cars with 200
F**k all these broke n****s
Cause all I do is ball

Went and bought a big and tall
N****s still scheming, we sliding on the mall!
I remember picking watermelons
Now the Porsche cost me a quarter million!
If I die tonight I know I'm coming back n***a
Reincarnated: big black fat n***a!

[Hook:]

Financial fanatic, 400 bricks in my attic
400K in my baggage, ? Automatic
You can't stop a bullet, this one for the money
Secret indictments, sport cars with 200
F**k your investigation, started my elevation
Cherry red 911 straight to my destination

Mayweather got a fight
Make me some reservations

Now it's stocks and bonds

They know a nigga's name, they know a nigga's strong
F**k wit me!

F**k your insinuation
?
Got me some scheming b*****s
Hustle, that's?
Hating, that switch the topic
Jump in my 911
2 bricks in my compartment!
She let me smell her p***y!
I know you smelling money!
She smell the gunpowder
911: 100 miles and running

[Hook:]
