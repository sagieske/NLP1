Song:

Something worn, like a blanket thrown
Your tender heart, your crystal spirit
Keeps me warm, and safe from harm
Wrapped around my shoulder

I love to wake, and watch your face
And while you sleep, I fall for you again
Is it true, what I feel for you
Wish I could help it through
So you could feel it too

And the leaves around my door
And the sunlight in the hall
And darkness that will fall
Make me want you more

Morning breaks, on the icy flakes
That collect around, our window
Its cold outside, brings a harsh goodbye
With clouds at our mouths, as we breath a sigh

As I look, like a long lending book
Page after page, we are turning
But, Is it true, what I feel for you
Wish I could help it through
So you could feel it too

And the leaves around my door
And the sunlight in the hall
And darkness that will fall
Just make me want you more
Oh make me want you more
Want you more
