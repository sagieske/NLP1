[Lil Wayne:]
Look At Me b***h
Look At Me b***h
Look At Me b***h
I'm An American Superstar

[Chorus: x2]
[Flo-Rida:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip
Paparazzi Taking Pictures
[Lil Wayne:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
And Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip
Paparazzi Taking Pictures

[Flo-Rida:]
Heavy Metal For Them Boys
Slanging Pedals For The Cash
Got An Appetite For Destruction
You Can Call Me Axel
Ask Me Bout What A Nikka Done Done
Ask Me Bout What A Nikka Do Well
Ask Me Were The Bricks Come From
That's What A Snitch Nikka Do They Tell
I Don't Want Nothing To Do With That Deal
If It's Selected I'm Bringing Them Shells
Only Position For Me Is A Playa
That's Right Playa
Better Get It Right Playa
I Have To Be In Emergency
Lucky For You If I'm Blowing My Trees
Come On My Nerve
No Regular me
It's Somebody Shawty With Me On Her Knees
I'm Ready If There's A Problem
She s*** Flo Rida Holla
Don't Test Me Get That Bro Harda
Get Messy Just Like A Mobster
My Brawls Deserve Lobsters
You Clowns Deserve Choppas
You Serve Like Jimmy Hoppa
American Showstoppa

[Chorus: x2]
[Lil Wayne:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
And Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip
Paparazzi Taking Pictures
[Flo-Rida:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip

[Lil Wayne:]
Look At Me b***h
Look At Me b***h
I got Money On Money On Money On Money
On Top Of More Money On Top Of My s**t Like Flies
Open That Ferrari F5 Like Eyes
Up And Down Ocean Drive
Jumping Out That Maybach With A b***h Way Back To Tease Them Thighs
She Got A Tattoo On Her Booty And It Say 305
Dj Khalid Say It's A Movie Now Don't Forget Your Line
Cause You Don't Want Me to Edit Before We Roll The Credits
B***h Give Me My Credit
I'm So Energetic
I'm f*****g Like Rabbits Smoking On Lettuce
But What Ever I Want I Get It
I Meant It If I Said It
And I Say I Keep Pumping I Ain't Talking Unleaded
If You Want It Come Get It
Cause Boy I'm Ready
I Get It Fast Fetty
They Should Call Me Tom Petty
Got Two b*****s One Peanut Butter Jelly
I'm An American Gangsta Already
And I'm An American Superstar

[Chorus: x2]
[Flo-Rida:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip
Paparazzi Taking Pictures
[Lil Wayne:]
I Got Guns For The Snitches
And Roses For The b*****s
Hop Up Off The Whip

[Lil Wayne:]
