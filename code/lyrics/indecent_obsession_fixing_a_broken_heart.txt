Song:

There was nothing to say the day you left
I just filled a suitcase full of regrets
I hailed a taxi in the rain
Looking for some place to ease the pain

Pre-Chorus:
Then like an answered prayer
I turned around and found you there
Chorus:
You really where start (you really know where to start)
Fixing a broken heart
You really know what to do
Your emotional tools
Can cure any fool
Whose dreams have fallen apart?
Fixing a broken heart
I never could understand
What you're going to through
There must be a plan that led me to you
Coz' all the heart just disappears
Every moment you are near

Pre-Chorus:
Just like an answered prayer
You make the loneliness easy to bear

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Soon the rain will stop falling, baby
So let's forget the past
Coz here we are at last
Repeat Chorus
