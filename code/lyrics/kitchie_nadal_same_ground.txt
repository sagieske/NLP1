Song:

My love
It's been a long time since I cried and left you out of the blue
It's hard leaving you that way when I never wanted to

Self denial is a game it's strange I never would've wanted 'til there was you
'Cause I have learned that love is beyond what human can imagine,
The more it clears
The more I gotta let you go

Chorus:
'Cause why I don't understand
Is why I'm feeling so bad now
When I know it was my idea
I could've just denied the truth and lied
And why am I the only one standing stranded on the same ground

My love
It's been a long time since I cried and left you out of the blue
It's hard leaving you that way when I never wanted to

Self denial is a game it's strange I never would've wanted 'til there was you
'Cause I have learned that love is a word gets thrown a little bit too much
The best excuse to fill this infinite abyss
I would never ever have to fail

(CHORUS x2)

If all else fails
Would you be there to love me?
When all else fails
Would you be brave to see right through me?
