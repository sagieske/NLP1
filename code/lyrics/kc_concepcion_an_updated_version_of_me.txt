Song:

I know I can be so awkward at times
I can be insecure
You can call me naive, you can say I'm a child
You can say I'm so immature
For me to say that I love you now
But you'll see I will prove somehow
I can be so much more

Someday there's gonna be
An updated version of me
And somehow you're gonna see
An udpated version of me

And there would be no reasons then
To tell me that I'm just a friend
I'll be a much better person, you'll see
An updated version of me

Maybe I should grow a much nicer nose
A much prettier set of eyes
Maybe I should wear more colorful clothes
If it'd help you to realize
I've never been this in love before
Never wanted to change at all
Now I'm willing to try...

Someday there's gonna be
An updated version of me
And somehow you're gonna see
An updated version of me
And there would be no reasons then
To tell me that I'm just a friend
I'll be a much better person, you'll see
An updated version of me...

Maybe then you'd realize
Or maybe you won't
If and when that happens
I'd still be the lucky one...

'Coz someday there's gonna be
An updated version of me
And somehow you're gonna see
And updated version of me
And someday you would realize
You've made awful compromise
And you'd wished that you had wath you missed
'Coz you'd miss a much better person
An updated version of me
You will see...
