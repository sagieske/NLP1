Song:

I can live, I can love
I can reach the heavens above
I can right what is wrong
I can sing just any song
I can dance, I can fly
And touch the rainbow in the sky
I can be your good friend
I can love you until the end

What took you so long to make me see
How lucky I am cause I am free
Free to do the things I wanna do
What took you so long to make me feel
How could it be look so real
What took you so long to let me know

That I can live, I can love
I can reach the heavens above
I can right what is wrong
I can sing just any song
I can dance, I can fly
And touch the rainbow in the sky
I can be your good friend
I can love you until the end

What took you so long to make me cry
So I'll know the reasons why
I'm so lucky I could smile
I didn't know this for a while

I can live, I can love
I can reach the heavens above
I can right what is wrong
I can sing just any song
I can dance, I can fly
And touch the rainbow in the sky
I can be your good friend
I can love you until the end

I can dance, I can fly
And touch the rainbow in the sky
I can be your good friend
I can love you until the end
