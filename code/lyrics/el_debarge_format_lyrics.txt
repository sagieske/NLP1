Song:

(Fifty)
Yeah, something new, 50
Shorty all that, yeah yeah Shorty all that
Gotta go hard yeah watch me switch up the format
Bus, a train, a plane, an exotic spot on a yacht
I spare no expense I want you here on top

Think big, big bread, big Bentley, big crib, big moves
I'm the most notorious since Big
If you want it you got it you spot it you tell me to get it you good.
Holding it down like I should, from Beverly Hills to the hood
This picture is perfect I'm painting I'm pushin my pen
To capture a portrait a moment in time with a friend
To get you the message I really want you to win
Girl if it's up to me it's you and I till the end.

(El)
See I know you got agendas, I remember
That you're the scheduled type of lady
But I've been patient, I need rotation
To the top of your list, call me crazy.
Don't ask me how, I'm looking at a few days from now
I need commitment cuz this don't make sense
How you got me looking right now

I might take the train, leave here on a plane, even in the rain, I'ma get this message to you
What I'm delivering is so much better when
You get it in person, so what I'm trying to do is
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at.
Let's switch up the format, I can't wait another day
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at.
Let's switch up the format girl, I can't wait another day to see you...

Listen I'ma need an e-mail, confirmation
Text me with the details, exact location
Press "Send" don't move (why) cuz I'm in route to where you at...
You got an appointment with destiny
You can cancel everything but me,
Reset your palm, bluetooth is on, no confusion
Where you at?

I might take the train, leave here on a plane, even in the rain
What I'm delivering is so much better when
You get it in person, so what I'm trying to do is
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at
Let's switch up the format, I can't wait another day
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at
Let's switch up the format girl, I can't wait another day, to see you
(Fifty)
Shorty all let that, yeah yeah shorty all what
Gotta go hard yeah watch me switch up the format
(El)
I just wanna see you with me on top
It's whatever you want cuz you know I gotchu girl
(Fifty)
If you want it you got it you spot it you tell me to get it you good.
Holding it down like I should, from Beverly Hills to the hood.
(El)
Ooh that's why I switched it up for you
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at...
Let's switch up the format, I can't wait another day
Switch up the format, let me come to where you're at...
Let's switch up the format girl, I can't wait another day, to see you
I'm running, I'm coming, I'm loving
I'm running, I'm coming, I'm loving, I'ma come back for you baby
I'm running, I'm coming, I'm loving, let me switch it up baby
I'm running, I'm coming, I'm loving, for you.
