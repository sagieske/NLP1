Song:

You're asking me
Why I love you so
Well I just feel it
I just know
How can I express to you what can I say
Why my heart beats for you this way

Refrain:
I'm not so good in saying what I feel
All I know is this
Is all for real
It seems that it would take me all the night
To find the words so right

Chorus:
But now what it's my mind is just because
Oh what else can I say but just because
Can't find no other way
You're asking me why I love you
When I find the words
Honey, i'll tell you
But for now I hope just because will do

(Repeat refrain and chorus)

No matter how hard I try
Can't seem to explain why
All I know is that I love you
So please believe me when I tell you...

(Repeat chorus)

But for now I hope just because will do
