Song:

Put your hands up
Let me lead you back with the beat of my heart
If you hear my song baby put your hands up
Just put your hands up, put your hands up

Can you hear just boom boom boom boom boom
My heart is going boom boom boom for you
Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
My heart is calling, calling, calling

Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom…
My heart is calling, calling, calling
My heart is calling, calling, calling…

Can you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
My heart is going boom boom boom for you
Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
My heart is calling, calling, calling…

Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom…
My heart is calling, calling, calling…

Everything is spinning now we just can’t stop
Moving to the rhythm, baby, you’re so hot
Now, if you love me, just put your hands up
Just put your hands up, up, up, up, up…

If you hear my song, baby, put your hands up
Put your hands in the air
Let me lead you back with the beat of my heart
If you hear my song, baby, put your hands up
Just put your hands up, put your hands up
My heart is calling, calling, calling…

Can you hear this boom boom boom boom
My heart is going boom boom boom for you
Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
My heart is calling, calling, calling…

Can’t you hear this boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom…
My heart is calling, calling, calling…
