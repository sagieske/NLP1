Song:

So many new faces
Familiar places
But I found my tracks to their hearts
And all the people I already know
I hope I left with a place in their hearts
Cause they left with a place in my heart
Ooohh

Its about time you're back in my life
Cause I miss you honey
Its about time you're back in my sight
Cause I need you honey

So all of these faces
And brand new places
And a fresh start to my life
And now I know where I wanna go
I'm gonna make sure I do it just right
Cause if I dont I know things wont feel right
Ooohh

Its about time you're back in my life
Cause I miss you honey
Its about time you're back in my sight
Cause I need you honey
But I dont need you honey
But I still miss you
Cause then it came so clearly
That I dont need you anymore

My best advice is to comprehend
Ditch this tention, make amends
for the new times, not old time
woooah
