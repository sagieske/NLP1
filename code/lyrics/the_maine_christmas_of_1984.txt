Song:

It was christmas of 1984
A cold cold storm near by
Michelle was cooking marshmellows
While barbra was getting a tatto

I was sittin' while I was changin' inta my zebra pattern tu-tu
I'm really cold by christmas 1984,
Cold cold cold cold cold,
I put in ma headphones and listened to music while
Babra went blaa-blaa and I was humming do-da-dee-dee I said do-da-dee-dee.
