Song:

Who am I that You are mindful of me
That You hear me when I call?
Isn't it true that You are thinking of me
How You love me, it's amazing

I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend

I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend

I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend

God Almighty, Lord of glory
You have called me friend

I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
I am a friend of God
He calls me friend

You call me friend
You call me friend
You call me friend
