Song:

Baby I love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we make can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced (X2)

I love you, yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until (until) the end (the end) of time

From the day I met you I knew we'd be together
And now I know I wanna be with you forever
I wanna marry you and I wanna have your kids
Thinking never compared to be without Your kisses

I can say I'm truly happy to this day
You made me thank god that I live my life everyday
There's never been a doubt(been a doubt) in my mind (in my mind)
That I regret ever having you by my side

But if the day comes that I have to let you go
I think there's somthin' I should probably let you know
Enjoyd everyday that I spent with you
And I will miss you but I'm happy that I had you at all

Baby I love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we made can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced (2X)

I love you ohh yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until (until) the end (the end) of time
