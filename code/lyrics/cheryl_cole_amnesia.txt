Amnesia 
Amnesia

There is no other way around it
We've come too far to turn around, yeah
You said we never should have done it
Because it complicates things now
Oooooh, but I beg to differ, don't you remember?
The things you said as we lay last night
Now who has amnesia? Let me remind ya, 
You were the one who said those things to me last night

And I heard you say... 
You should be, you could be, why can't we?
You should be, you should be with me... 
We could be, why don't we, can you see?
You should be, you should be with me... 

In the heat of the moment you let it slip
But today you switched it all around (switched it all around)
Trying to make it seem I was the only one, who... 
Let my guard down
But I beg to differ, don't you remember?
The things you said as we lay last night
Now who has amnesia? Let me remind ya, 
You were the one who said those things to me last night

And I heard you say... 
You should be, you could be, why can't we?
You should be, you should be with me... 
We could be, why don't we, can't you see?
You should be (you should be), you should be with me... 
(What happened to what should be...)
You should be, you could be, why can't we?
(I know heard it...)
You should be, you should be with me... 
Baby, you should be with me... 
We could be, why don't we, can't you see?
You should be, you should be with me... 

I set myself up for this, it was too good to be true
I believe what you said when you said it
That's what little talk can do
Today is another day, I get it
Yeah your hungry desire, I fed it
Only gonna let me down if I let it
I just wish that you never said it (no...)

You should be, you could be, why can't we?
You should be, baby you should be with me... 
We could be, why don't we, can't you see?
You should be, you should be with me... 
(I heard you say it! )
You should be, you could be, why can't we?
You should be, you should be with me... 
We could be, why don't we, can't you see?
You should be, you should be with me... 
Amnesia
(You should be with me...)
Amnesia
(You should be with me...)
Amnesia
(You should be with me...)
Amnesia
(You should be with me...)
Amnesia
Amnesia
Amnesia
