Hustlenomics!

Pull out the chevrolets n***a
(Well if dey gon' pull 'em out, what years dey need to pull out trick?)
Pull out da 71's, 72's & 76 n***a
(Ha ha, well tell 'em who ya is shawty)
Don dadda, dunk rida
(See what did, I said, imma go & get me a eal n***a who know bout' muthafuckin chevy's
Inside & out, from the muthafuckin digi-dash to da muthafuckin pipes)
You betta b-lieve it
(you know who it is, trick daddy, yung joc, lets go)

I like the way, the grill on my chevrolet smile (the grill on my chevrolet smile)
I like the way, the rims on my chevy go roun' (the rims on my chevy go roun')
I like the way, the top on my chevy go down (the top on my chevy go down)
I like the way, the chevy make the girls go wild (the chevy make the girls go wild)

64 chevrolet ssm, 24 suntan dat fresh pimp
You think I'm ridin peanut butter, naw dats chocolate chip
I love da way the paint drip, love da way the paint flip
Got the antique step, fishbowl lamp
415 beat'n wit da 2 stolen amps
Either way wit da butterfly, doors on suicide, 5 % tint keep dem ho's guessin who inside
Now da neighbors mad cuz my feet down low,
Now da haters mad cuz dey freaks down low
Yeah da color scheme match dese new gucci loafers,
Plastic on da seats like my grandmama sofa

I like the way, the grill on my chevrolet smile (the grill on my chevrolet smile)
I like the way, the rims on my chevy go roun' (the rims on my chevy go roun')
I like the way, the top on my chevy go down (the top on my chevy go down)
I like the way, the chevy make the girls go wild (the chevy make the girls go wild)

I got da work to match da hard top, fresh out da supermart
Err'where I go dey follow da car show
Yo, I hit a right, dey hit a right
I hit da gas & leave dey a** bout 4 or 5 lights
Gettin followed by dese bougie broads, because dey like da car
Dey dig my swag, too bad b***h, this aint for yall
This for dem bottom b*****s, all about da dolla b*****s
Independent, but love fuckin wit real ni***z
This for my thug ni***z, gettin rich drug dealin
My trap stars wit big walls & fast cars
Dunk ridin, trunk poundin, glass-housing, now dats some real down south s**t

I like the way, the grill on my chevrolet smile (the grill on my chevrolet smile)
I like the way, the rims on my chevy go roun' (the rims on my chevy go roun')
I like the way, the top on my chevy go down (the top on my chevy go down)
I like the way, the chevy make the girls go wild (the chevy make the girls go wild)

Da grill on my chevy like tv juggins
Smile so bright, you can see me comin
Say you wanna race, playboy we can run it
Say you got a hemi, my chevy'll out run it
I hope you got navigation cuz pimpin you lost
Police think you smokin good, dats jus my exhaust
Betta get some anti-freeze & let'cha s**t cool off
Minks on my flo', b***h, take ya shoes off
Treat my chevy like a lac, don't slam my doors
I'm ridin like a mac, backseat full of ho's
I got a cush pack, we gon blow this whole oathe
Mattafact let'cha seat back & ride out slow

I like the way, the grill on my chevrolet smile (the grill on my chevrolet smile)
I like the way, the rims on my chevy go roun' (the rims on my chevy go roun')
I like the way, the top on my chevy go down (the top on my chevy go down)
I like the way, the chevy make the girls go wild (the chevy make the girls go wild)

Come chill wit me, if you wanna see what I'm ridin on
I might even take you home, I might even take you home

In my chevy...
(What'chu ridin on?) dubs
(What'chu ridin on?) dueces
(What'chu ridin on?) tres
(What'chu ridin on?) fours
(What'chu ridin on?) sixes
(What'chu ridin on?) eights
(What'chu ridin on?) thirty's
Listen to what I say

(What'chu ridin on?) dueces
(What'chu ridin on?) tres
(What'chu ridin on?) fours
(What'chu ridin on?) sixes
