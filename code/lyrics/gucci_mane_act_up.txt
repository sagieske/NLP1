Song:

I ain’t never want a grammy, I ain’t never been a nominee
Bees in my hummer vee, 30 gram for one of these
I don’t like these pussy ass nigga just like Chief Keef
Bonne apetit, when I eat nigga, fish feast
Eat your …capiscis, keep her on a short leash
Hair beaver bc’s cause they know they fear me
Those all talk, all grind in my free g
You came to the game but you wait in the cheap seat

[Hook]
I swear they don’t want me to succeed
But I’m not letting them leave
Until I stop them from breathe
And I ain’t fucking wrong
Don’t let them get to dough
Man it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I’ma do, what I’ma do, on my new, got a …
What about you, but I ain’t fucking wrong
Don’t let them get your dough

I got killers on my pay roll, moving when I say so
These hoes don’t really love me, they just love I got a bank roll
Plug he keep send the blow, he ain’t never said no
He mixing on the head, they broken, I can’t understand foe
I’m talking to you pussy ass nigga, you better listen
Step his ass so hard, with that crystal, he pay detention
Jump out with them K’s, start hitting, cause they was snitching…

[Hook]
I swear they don’t want me to succeed
But I’m not letting them leave
Until I stop them from breathe
And I ain’t fucking wrong
Don’t let them get to dough
Man it will make a nigga really wanna act up
Cause I’ma do, what I’ma do, on my new, got a …
What about you, but I ain’t fucking wrong
Don’t let them get your dough
