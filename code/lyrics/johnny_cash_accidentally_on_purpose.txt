Song:

Accidentaly I saw you this morning you were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me that had drifted to our old hometown
Accidentaly you've met him one evening and you say it was love at first sight
Accidentaly on purpose you've married accidentaly on purpose for spite
Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentaly you were mistaken that night accidentaly on purpose for spite
[ guitar ]
Cause I saw out cheatin'...
