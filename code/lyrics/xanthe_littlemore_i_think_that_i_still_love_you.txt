Song:

V1) Did my heart once fly like a bird?
Did I once have you near me?
Look at me now, I'm on the ground
Telling myself it can't be true

Ch) But I think that I still love you, what am I to do?
I can't stop thinking about you, no I can't get over you
You and I are somehow in my heart together still
I think that I still love you, and I always will

V2) And now I wake up alone
In the bright early morning
Where you once slept there's nothing left
The sun's streamin' in but I'm so cold

Ch) And I think that I still love you, what am I to do?
I can't stop thinking about you, no I can't get over you
You and I are somehow in my heart together still
I think that I still love you, and I always will

Bridge) Every day I miss you even more
I keep lying to myself that I don't need you, no more, no more

Ch) But I think that I still love you, what am I to do?
I can't stop thinking about you, no I can't get over you
You and I are somehow in my heart together still
I think that I still love you, and I always will
