Song:

Center on the wide horizon
Focus on the galaxy
Sweep away your expectations
And recognise your enemies

But here you're talking to yourself
You're stripping off for someone else
You've got to learn to love yourself
It's all that counts, there's little else

You're always looking for affection
And all it's possibilities
Your sense is searching for attention,
Emerging need of gravity

I think you think you're someone else
You've got to learn to save yourself
Before you find there's nothing left
But bitterness and holiness
And afterglow
And afterglow
