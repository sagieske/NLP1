Song:

Dark secrets always turns out to be the best
Why does the rain always seem so black
Bleeding for more to satisfy my everything
Sealed from the others, leading me down

For the apparition of my longing
I borrowed a smile, unfaithful to reality
To dignify my hollowness
Bewildered minds declaring this world for me
Drowned by this burden

This is my confession, my lament to you
It's me, I've painted the walls
It's a portrait, of a black paradise
From this day on I will look at life through darkness

This is my confession, my lament to you
It's me, I've painted the walls
It's a portrait, of a black paradise
From this day on I will look at life with my eyes closed

Here is my confession, my last one to do
From this moment, I will shut my eyes
I look through the window, I look upon the world I face
What do I see, it's a rainy day

Dark secrets always turns out to be the best
I can't restrain always forced to go back
Bleeding for more to satisfy my everything
Sealed from the others, leading me down
