Song:

Sitting on the edge of the balcony
Waiting for you to pull in
Put on your favourite lingerie
Had it on all day
I had the candles lit, your dinner warm
And I was your dessert baby
Now what happened to courtesy
Never told me you were running late

I heard you coming my body over to the bed
Then I close my eyes and it was time
You were right here

I tried to wait for you
But you took too long to get here
I had the night planned for you
Now I don't need another hand
I'll be fine without you by my side
Without you I'll be fine
I'll take care of mine
I can't deny baby
It's looking like one of those nights
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
Yeah yeah

I couldn't control my fingertips
Didn't do it to make you jealous
But the waiting grew ridiculous I couldn't wait for your help
Every minute was so visual even though you were invisible
Didn't even turn the key but baby catch up with me

I heard you coming my body over to the bed
Then I close my eyes and it was time
You were right here

I tried to wait for you
But you took too long to get here
I had the night planned for you
Now I don't need another hand
I'll be fine without you by my side
Without you I'll be fine
I'll take care of mine
I can't deny baby
It's looking like one of those nights
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
Yeah yeah

I just had to do this
Put on my favourite music
Should have made it home a little sooner baby
It just made me lose it, ooh yeah
Touch me baby

I tried to wait for you
But you took too long to get here
I had the night planned for you
Now I don't need another hand
I'll be fine without you by my side
Without you I'll be fine
I'll take care of mine
I can't deny baby
It's looking like one of those nights
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
When I make me come alive
Baby alive
Baby alive
Baby
Yeah yeah

Yeah yeah
I make me come alive
Alive alive
Yeah yeah
Yeah
