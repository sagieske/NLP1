Song:

Tryin' hard to fight these tears
Crazy worried
Messin' with my head this fear
I'm so sorry
You know, you gotta get it out
I can't take it
That's what bein' friends about

I, I wanna cry
I can't deny
Tonight I wanna up and hide
And get inside
It isn't right
I gotta live in my life!

I know I I know I
I know I gotta do it!
I know I I know I
I know I gotta do it!

Gotta turn the world into your dance floor!
Determinate! Determinate!
Push until you can't and then demand more!
Determinate! Determinate!
You and me together!
We can make it better!
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate! Determinate!

Hate to feel this way
It was today
I gotta get myself on stage!
I shouldn't wait
Or be afraid
The chips will fall where they may!

I know I I know I
I know I gotta do it!
I know I I know I
I know I gotta do it!

Gotta turn the world into your dance floor!
Determinate! Determinate!
Push until you can't and then demand more!
Determinate! Determinate!
You and me together!
We can make it better!
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate! Determinate!

Okay, it's Wen and I'm heaven sent
Music like a veteran
Renegade, lemonade use it as my medicine
Go ahead and try to name a band we ain't better than
Reason why the whole world's pickin' us instead of them
People need a breather cuz they're feelin' that adrenaline
Stop!
Now hurry up and let us in
Knock!
Cuz we comin' to your house
And people keep on smilin' like thet got lemons in their mouth
I'm the real deal, you know how it feel
Why they're in it for the millsl
We're in it for the thrills
So get down... Now...
We don't play around
Put your feet up off the ground
And just make that sound... Cuz...

Gotta turn the world into your dance floor!
Determinate! Determinate!
Push until you can't and then demand more!
Determinate! Determinate!
You and me together!
We can make it better!
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate! Determinate!

C'mon and
C'mon and
C'mon and get it goin'
C'mon and c'mon and get it goin
C'mon and
C'mon and
C'mon and get it goin'
On the dance floor
On the dance floor
D-d-dance floor
Determinate!
