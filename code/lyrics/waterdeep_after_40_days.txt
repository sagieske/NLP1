Song:

You set before me all my dreams
And vowed to give me everything
You said I did not have to choose
But Father he would disagree with you
You took Him to a mountaintop
And showed Him all the world
"To you I will give all you see
If you will bow and worship me as king"
The words that you spoke then
Were vows to be broken
And I will not hold on to these
Your promises your promises
Have only left me all alone
And selfish dreams your selfish dreams
I will no longer listen to them
