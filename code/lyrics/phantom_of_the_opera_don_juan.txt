Song:

Chorus:
Here the sire may serve the dam, here the master takes his meat! Here the sacrifical lamb utters one dispairing bleat.

Carlotta and chorus
Poor young maiden! For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets, you will have to pay the bill- tangled in the winding sheets! Serve the meal and serve the maid! Serve the master so that, when tables, plans and maids are laid Don Juan triumphs once again!

Don juan (Piangi)
Passarino faithful friend, once again recite the plan

Passarino
Your young guest believes I'm you- I, the master, you the man,

Don juan(Piangi)
When you met, you wore my cloak, she could not have seen your face. She believes she dines with me in her master's borrowed place! Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff, stealing what in truth is mine. When it's late and modesty starts to mellow with the wine.

Passarino
You come home! I use your voice- slam the door like crack of doom!

Don juan (Piangi)
I shall say, "come hide with me! where oh where? of course my room"

Passarino
Poor thing hasn't got a chance

Don juan(Piangi)
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword. Comquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh *laughs*

Aminta(Christine)
"...no thoughts within her head but thoughts of joy. no dreams within her heart, but dreams of love."

Passarino
Master?

Don juan(Phantom)
(spoken-ish)passarino- go away! For the trap is set and waits for his prey You have come here
In pursuit of your deepest urge In pursuit of that wish which till now Has been (suddenly gets soft)silent Silent. (suddenly loud)I have brought you That our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind you've already succumbed to me, dropped all defenses Completely succumbed to me Now you are here with me No second thoughts (softer)You've decided
Decided.
