Song:

This love for you it cannot hide
This love is deep deep inside
He's got you on his mind.
To think about it would wreck his mind
To let it go would free his soul
But he's got you he's got you on his mind
But he's not worried, no he's not worried
And he's not wonderin', no he's not wonderin'
Lord he's not worried, no he s not worried
He's got you got you he's got you on his mind
I see you as an island filled with gold
For your love I tried but I couldn't hold.
But he's got you got you he's got you on his mind
To think about it Lord would wreck his mind
And to let it go would free his soul
But he's got you got you he's got you on his mind
But he's not worried, no he's not worried
And he s not wonderin', no he s not wonderin'
Lord he s not worried, no he s not worried
He's got you got you he's got you on his mind
