Song:

Hate - All I see is blood red
Pain - like thorns in my heart
Kill - Cold steel in my hands
Die - Those motherfuckers have to pay

Anger! - My mind burns
Anger! - All veins explode
Anger! - Blinded eyes
Anger! And pain...

Burn - Fire walks with me
Madness - It is all I feel
Is there any chance - to save it all
And touch our Earth not soaked with blood...

[Lead: Marek / Peter]

Hate - All I see is blood
Pain - like nails in my hands
Kill - many pierced fleshes
Die - Now all have to pay

Anger! - My mind burns
Anger! - All veins explode
Anger! - Blinded eyes
Anger! - World's collapse!... Now
