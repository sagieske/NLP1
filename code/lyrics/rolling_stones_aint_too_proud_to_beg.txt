Song:

I know you wanna leave me; I refuse to let you go.
If I have to beg, plead for sympathy,
I don't mind, 'cause it means that much to me.
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.

Well I heard a quiet man, is half a man, with no sense of pride,
If I have to cry to keep ya I don't mind weepin'
If weepin' gonna keep ya by my side.
Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.

If I have to sleep on your door step all night and day,
Just to keep you from walkin' away;
Let my friends laugh, for this I can stand
Just so long as I keep from going up for grabs.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.

Well your love's so deep in the pit of my heart,
Ev'ry day it grows more and more.
I'm not ashamed to come and plead with you, baby,
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out the door.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby;
Please don't leave me, don't you go.
