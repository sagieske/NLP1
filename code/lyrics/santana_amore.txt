Song:

It's like the ocean baby
You make me feel so s***
Love so understanding
For only you I'm waiting
You turn me on
My love is on and on and

You touch me makes me crazy
I feel your body and me
It's like the ocean at sea
My love is never ending
You and me
It's like a dream my baby

Amore, sexo
Amore, my love is on and on and on
Amore, sexo
Amore, my love is on and on

It's like the wind beneath me
The passion flows so freely
Close to you I get free
Whenever you fill my needs
I turn you on
My love is on and on and

I feel it all in my knees
And I know how good it will be
It's like the wind beneath me
My love is never ending
You and me
It's like a dream my baby

Amore, sexo
Amore, my love is on and on and on
Amore, sexo
Amore, my love is on and on
