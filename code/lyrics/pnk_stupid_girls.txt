Stupid girl
Stupid girls
Stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne
Drop a name

What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancin' in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of 2 or 3
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teenie weenie tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore

I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see

Disasters all around
(Disasters all around)
A world of despair
(A world of despair)
Their only concern
“Will it f**k up my hair?”

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Do your thing, an' do your thing
Do your thing, an' do your thing, yeah
I like this
Like this, like this

Pretty “will you f**k me” girl
Silly “I'm so lucky” girl
“Pull my hair, I'll suck it” girl
Stupid girl!

Pretty “will you f**k me” girl
Silly “I'm so lucky” girl
“Pull my hair, I'll suck it” girl
Stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
