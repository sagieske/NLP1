Day three
It's been a long week
Mondays are the worse for me
Cold feet, as I'm slowly
Approaching home (oh can't you say?)
When she asks me, (in a semi?)
Why you breaking my heart silently
Ain't no telling what price I'm gonna pay
I wish, I could just erase the taste that keeps a weighing on my mind
To be honest baby I've wasted your time

She's the one
I can't run
Anymore, I don't deserve you
I believe
It's killing me
To know the life we were building is ending
If it's broken then tell me what's the use
Of a heart so black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Of a heart so black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Of a heart so black and blue

Flashbacks, to the hotel room
Where every little kiss was like a honeymoon baby
So lost in the moment, I can't even lie
Cause I don't have no regrets, I know I truly tried
To erase the taste that keeps a weighing on my mind
To be honest I've really wasted your time
She's the one
I can't run
Anymore, I don't deserve you
I believe
It's killing me
To know the life we were building is ending
If it's broken then tell me what's the use
Of a heart so black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Of a heart so black and blue

Can you tell me why you
Stayed so long to see through it all (my life)
You knew there was someone else
Soo you're taking the fall
I'm losing mo-ore

She's the one
I can't run
Anymore, I don't deserve you
I believe
It's killing me
To know the life we were building is ending
If it's broken then tell me what's the use
Of a heart so black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Of a heart so black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue
Of a heart so black and blue
