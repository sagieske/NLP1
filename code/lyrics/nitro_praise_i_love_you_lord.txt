Song:

I love you Lord,
And I lift my voice
To worship you.

All my soul rejoices.
Take joy my King
In what you hear.
Let it be a sweet,
Sweet sound in your ear.

I love you Lord,
And I lift my voice
To worship you.

All my soul rejoices.
Take joy my King
In what you hear.
Let it be a sweet,
Sweet sound in your ear.

Open our eyes, Lord.
We want to see Jesus.
To reach out and touch Him,
And say that we love Him.

Open our ears, Lord.
And teach us to listen.
Open our eyes, Lord.
We want to see Jesus.

Open our eyes, Lord.
We want to see Jesus.
To reach out and touch Him.
And say that we love Him.

Open our ears, Lord.
And teach us to listen.
Open our eyes, Lord,
We want to see Jesus.
