Ban The Bomb

Wrap yourself in silver paper put a sandbag on your head
Crawl inside your fall-out shelter underneath your garden shed
Boil an egg, have a cuddle, cut your toe-nails, make the bed
By the time this record's finished, everybody will be...

Wrap yourself in silver paper put a sandbag on your head
Crawl inside your fall-out shelter underneath your garden shed
Boil an egg, have a cuddle, cut your toe-nails, make the bed
By the time this record's finished, everybody will be dead

Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb

For those that do not wish to die, raise up your voices to the sky
And sing away the missiles

Wash your smalls, feed the cactus, telephone your uncle Fred
By the time this record's finished everybody will be dead

Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb
Ban the bomb...
