Song:

You told so many lies
Your tongue is black with fireflies
But you spit them out and pretend you're sneezing
And every word is such a joke
With so many pasts you'd be ninety years old
Don't you wonder why the room keeps on leaving

Hey, Hey - what's that I heard you say
Don't think that I would never need it
Hey Hey - what's that I heard you say
Don't think that I would ever believe it

It's just a thought and nothing more
That all your thoughts and moves are taught
And memorised each night before your sleeping
And every word is such a joke
Strung form neon masts flying flags you hope
Will win you friends and give your life some meaning

Hey, Hey - what's that I heard you say
Don't think that I would ever need it
Hey, Hey - what's that I heard you say
Don't think that I would ever believe it

You told so many lies
Your tongue is stained with Alibis
You've been around the world and found it pleasing
And every word is such a joke
With so many pasts you'd be a hundred years old
Don't you wonder why the room keeps on leaving

Hey, Hey - what's that I heard you say
