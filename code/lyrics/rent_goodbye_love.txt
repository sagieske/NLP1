Song:

Mimi
It's True You Sold Your Guitar And
Bought A Car?

Roger
It's True - I'm Leaving Now For Santa Fe
It's True You're With This Yuppie Scum?

Benny
You Said You'd Never Speak To Him
Again

Mimi
Not Now

Maureen
Who Said That You Have Any Say
In Who She Says Things To At All?

Roger
Yeah!

Joanne
Who Said That You Should Stick Your
Nose In Other People's...

Maureen
Who Said I Was Talking To You?

Joanne
We Used To Have This
Fight Each Night
She'd Never Admit I
Existed

Mark
Calm Down

Everyone Please

Mimi
He Was The Same Way - He Was Always
"Run Away - Hit The Road
Don't Commit"-You're Full Of s**t
Joanne
She's In Denial

Mimi
He's In Denial

Joanne
You Give An Inch
When I Gave A Mile

Mark
Come On

Mimi
I Gave A Mile

Roger
Gave A Mile To Who?

Mark & benny
Come On Guys Chill!

Mimi & joanne
I'd Be Happy To Die For A Taste
Of What Angel Had
Someone To Live For-Unafraid
To Say I Love You

Roger
All Your Words Are Nice Mimi
But Love's Not A Three Way Street
You'll Never Share Real Love
Until you Love Your Self-I Should Know

Collins
You All Said You'd Be Cool Today
So Please-For My Sake...

I Can't Believe He's Gone
I Can't Believe your'e Going (to Roger)
I Can't Believe This Family Must Die

Angel Helped Us Believe In Love
I Can't Believe You Disagree

All
I Can't Believe This Is Goodbye

[Maureen and Joanne reconcile and go home. Collins
Returns to the funeral home. Roger walks off Mimi and Benny leave
Together. Roger and Mark are left alone.]

Mark
I Hear There Are Great Restaurants
Out West

Roger
Some Of The Best. How Could She?

Mark
How Could You Let Her Go?

Roger
You Just Don't Know... How Could We
Lose Angel?

Mark
Maybe You'll See Why When You Stop
Escaping Your Pain
At Least Now If You Try-Angel's Death
Won't Be In Vain

Roger
His Death Is In Vain

Mark
Are You Insane?
There's So Much To Care About
There's Me-There's Mimi-

Roger
Mimi's Got Her Baggage Too

Mark
So Do You

Roger
Who Are You To Tell Me What I Know,
What To Do

Mark
A Friend

Roger
Who Who, Mark, Are You?
"Mark Has Got His Work"
They Say "Mark Lives For His Work"
And "Mark's In Love With His Work"
Mark Hides In His Work

Mark
From What?

Roger
From Facing Your Failure, Facing Your
Loneliness
Facing The Fact You Live A Lie
Yes, You Live A Lie - Tell You Why

You're Always Preaching Not To
Be Numb
When That's How You Thrive
You Pretend To Create And Observe

When You Really Detach From Feeling
Alive

Mark
Perhaps It's Because I'm The One Of Us
To Survive

Roger
Poor Baby

Mark
Mimi Still Loves you
Are you Really Jealous
Or Afraid That Mimi's Weak

Roger
Mimi Did Look Pale

Mark
Mimi's Gotten Thin
Mimi's Running Out Of Time
And you're Running Out The Door--

Roger
No More! Oh no!

I've Gotta Go

Mark
Hey, for somebody who's always been let down
Who's heading out of town?

Roger
For someone who longs for a commmunity of his
Own, who's with his camera, alone?

I'll call

I hate the fall

(Mimi re-enters)

Roger
You Heard?

Mimi
Every Word
You Don't Want Baggage Without
Lifetime Guarantees

You Don't Want To Watch Me Die?
I Just Came To Say
Goodbye, Love
Goodbye, Love
Came To Say Goodbye, Love, Goodbye

Mimi
Just Came To Say
Goodbye Love
Goodbye Love
Goodbye Love,
Goodbye!
(Roger leaves, Benny enters)
Roger
Glory
One Blaze Of
Glory
Have To Find

Mimi
Please Don't Touch Me
Understand
I'm Scared
I Need To Go Away

Mark
I Know A Place - A Clinic

Benny
A Rehab?

Mimi
Maybe--Could You?

Benny
I'll Pay

Mimi
Goodbye Love
Goodbye Love
Came To Say Goodbye, Love, Goodbye

Just Came To Say
Goodbye Love
Goodbye Love
Goodbye Love
Hello - Disease

[Mimi runs away. Collins is booted from the funeral
Home when he can't pay the bill. Benny offers to pay;
Hen he and Collins go drinking. Mark stays behind to
Prepare for his meeting with "Buzzline".]
