Song:

Right now!

Take the sword and holdin' high
Feel the warning of the night
Out in the cold, we burn the world
That feels the fear and the pain

Hear the voice of silent ground
The time has come, Open the door
Out in the cold, they bring the dark
But we don't fear any more

Breaking the chains of pain
Into the field of hate
You'll see the ancient rage
Your heart is aching
There is no fear, We are one
We're keeping the faith of steel

Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So I never die
Take your weapon and saddle your horse
Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So right now

The blight of sword will be a sign
Follow it. Now it's your turn
We make the world of the free
Keeping fight on and on

Breaking the chains of pain
Into the field of hate
You'll see the ancient rage
Your heart is aching
There is no fear. We are one
We're keeping the faith of steel

Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So I never die
Take your weapon and saddle your horse
Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So right now

Take the sword and holdin' high
Feel the warning of the night
Just wait to walk away
See the sign
We are children of steel
Take the sword and holdin' high
Feel the warning of the night
Just wait to walk away
See the sign
It's my time to revenge

Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So I never die
Take your weapon and saddle your horse
Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So I never die
Take your weapon and saddle your horse
Now I running fast
There is the battle I must win
So right now
