Song:

Awful sweet to be a little butterfly
Just wingin' over things and nothing deep inside
Nothing goin', goin' wild in you, you know
You're slowin' by the riverside
A-floatin' high and blue
Or maybe cool to be a little summer wind
Like once through everything and then away again
With the taste of dust in your mouth all day but no need to know
Like sadness
You just sail away

'cause ya' know
I don't do sadness
Not even a little bit
Just don't need it in my life

Don't want any part of it
I don't do sadness
Hey, I've done my time,
Lookin' back on it all
And it blows my mind
I don't do sadness
So been there,
Don't do sadness
Just don't care

[Spoken interlude/Blue Wind]

So maybe I should be some kind of laundry line.
Hang their things on me, and I will swing em' dry
You just wave in the sun through the afternoon
And then see, they come to set you free, beneath the rising moon

'cause ya' know // Spring and Summer
I don't do sadness // every other day
Not even a little bit // Blue Wind gets so lost
Just don't need it in my life // Blowin' through the thick corn, through the bales of hay
Don't want any part of it // Spring and Summer
I don't do sadness // Every other day
Hey, I've done my time, // Blue Wind gets so lost
Lookin' back on it all // Blowin' through the thick corn
And it blows my mind // through the bales of hay
I don't do sadness // The wandering clouds
So been there, // of the dust
Don't do sadness // spring and summer
Just don't care //
