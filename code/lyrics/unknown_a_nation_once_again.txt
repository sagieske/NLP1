Song:

A Man Without a Woman
Now a man without a woman is like a ship without a sail
Is like a boat without a rudder, or a shirt without a tail
Now a man without a woman is like a wreck upon the sand
But if there is one thing worse in this universe
Then it's a woman, I said a woman
I mean a woman without a man
