Song:

If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

I'll go anywhere,
West Virginia baby I don't care
Mexico on wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a post card back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when

I'll go anywhere,
West Virginia baby I don't care
Mexico on wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

Yeahhh I'll go anywhere
West Virginia baby I don't care
Mexico on wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere
Girl I'll swear
Just say the word
I'll take you there
Aww anywhere, anywhere with you

Yeah I'll go anywhere with you
