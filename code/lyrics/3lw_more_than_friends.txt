Song:

That's Right...........
That's Right.......

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes I wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead
I wish we could be more than friends

It's time to let you know just how do I feel
About that day (that's right) you drive me crazy (that's right)
If she ever let you go then you know the deal
Boy you will be mine
Til the end of time

It's the same dream
Over and over
(I can see us walking and holding hands)
You and me
Closer and closer
(If everything was different you'd my man)

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes I wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead
I wish that we could be more than friends

Waking up to the morning each day
I think of you and how I wish
I were the special girl in her place (that's right)
Every time you see me with the smile on my face
I just can't help but wish for the day

It's the same dream
Over and Over
I can see use walking and holding hands
You and me
Closer and closer
If everything was different you'd be my man

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes I wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead
I wish that we could be more than friends

More than friends (more than friends)......
More than friends (more.... Than friends).......
More than friends......

That's right....
That's right.......

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes I wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead
I wish that we could be more than friends

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends (I wish.. I wish)
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy (crazy....) about her
Sometimes I (I...........)wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead
I wish that we could be more than friends (I wish we we could be more than friends)
