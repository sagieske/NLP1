Song:

I don't expect my love affairs to last for long
Never fool myself that my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble, I'd anticipate it
But all the same I hate it, wouldn't you

So what happens now
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to

Time and time again, I've said that I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom that I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters, all my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me and they do

So what happens now
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to

Call in three months time and I'll be fine I know
Well, maybe not that fine but I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places of this sad occasion
But that's no consolation, here and now

So what happens now
(Another suitcase in another hall)
So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by, you always have before)
Where am I going to
