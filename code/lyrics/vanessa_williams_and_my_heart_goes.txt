Song:

You make my heart go.....
Inside out you send me baby
Round and round your world
Upside down you make me crazy
For you love; it's out of control

Like an evening star
Shining brightly through me
When you look into my eyes
I know we have something
I'm following my heart
Trusting where love will lead
Surrendering my guard
I found security; oh in you
Darling you're the one for me
Tell me did you know

Chorus:
You make my heart go.....
Inside out you send me baby
Round and round your world
Upside down you make me crazy
For you love; it's out of control

Like a fairy tale
You kissed life into me
You cast my fears away
Finally I'm free
Anyone can see I'm crazy for you
You're everything I need
You're all I want to do
It's true loving you is magical
Tell me did you know

Chorus

And my heart goes
Inside and out
And my heart feels
I'm losin control
Cause my heart knows
The only one for me,
Uh baby can't you see
And my heart goes
You turn me upside down
And my heart feels
You turn me round and round
Cause my heart knows
Baby don't you know

Chorus

You make my heart go
Ooh baby, so in love
You make my heart go
You know, it's for your love

You turn it upside down
You turn it round and round
You make my heart go
And my heart feels
Cause my heart knows
You make my heart go
