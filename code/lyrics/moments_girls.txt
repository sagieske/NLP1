Song:

Hey Whatnots, what's happenin'
Well Moments, what it is, brother
Hey can I talk about what I wanna talk about this
What is that
Girls
Right on

Girls, I like 'em fat, I like 'em tall
Some skinny, some small, I got to get to know them all
Girls, love the things they know, love the things they
Show
Got to be with a girl - pretty girls
The sunshine in their hair, the perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere

I'd like to be on an island with five or six of them
Fine ones
With one that ain't good lookin'
They're the ones that do the best cookin'
Give me one with a lot of money
Give me two with lots of honey
Give me three that do them freaky things
Give me four, five more that like to swing

Girls, I love the things they know, love the things
They show
Got to be with a girl - bad girls
The sunshine in their hair, the perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere

Girls - super fine, mighty fine, sugar and spice
Everything nice - ah-hah-hah

I'd like to be a magician then I could stop wishin'
I'd take my magic wand, and poof, I'd have me fun
If the guys could see me, they'd swear I was Hoodini
Before they could count from one to three
I'd have ten girls standin' next to me

Girls, I love the things they know, love the things
They show
Got to be with a girl - sweet girls
The sunshine in their hair, the perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere

Girls, love the things they know, love the things they
Show
Got to be with a girl - pretty girls
The sunshine in their hair, the perfume that they wear
Girls are everywhere

Girls, super fine, mighty fine, sugar and spice
Everything nice, sugar and spi
