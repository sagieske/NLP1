Song:

I know you're listening
As I lay me down to sleep
It's not for me, I ask
But my children's souls to keep

It seems the world is going crazy
And though I need to do my share

Could you please, take them under wing
Watch over them especially
Keeping them safe from everything
This is a mother's prayer

I know you're listening
In the silence of this night
The news is blistering
But I hold on to your light

And though there's darkness all around us
By my faith, I know you're there

Give me the strength to lead the way
Send me the words I need to say
Use me to guide them day by day
This is a mother's prayer

I know, I can't do this by myself
I thank you for your help

I know you're listening
So I know, I'm not alone
I feel you here with me
As we all face the unknown

Could you return us to your garden
Where no one's hurt and no one's scared

Free us from pride and bitterness
Keep us so close we won't forget
Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's prayer

Teach us to love as you love
This is a mother's prayer
