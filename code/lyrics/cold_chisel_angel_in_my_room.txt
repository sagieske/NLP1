Song:

There's an angel in the shadows of my room
And she watches me when I'm all alone
When my sad heart is hurt and crying
That's when she comes to me
And she leads me home
If I close my eyes
And I take her hand
I can see you right there
Where my angel stands
Into the night when I'm missing you
I lay me down with the angel in my room
And in the shadows she stands alone
And she's waiting for me
When I'm coming home
Into the night when I'm missing you
I lay me down with the angel in my room
I see the tears in my baby's eyes
But in the distance I still hear her cry
And baby I'm longing but it passes by
When I hold you in my arms
Everything will be all right
If I close my eyes I can see her there
I can see you right there
Where my angel stands
Into the night when I'm missing you
I lay me down with the angel in my room
That's when I lay me down with the angel in my room
