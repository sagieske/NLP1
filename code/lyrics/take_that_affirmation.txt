Song:

It's just a fraction of time,
Until we move into reverse,
Can feel the pressure in all our minds,
And the whole Universe.
Is it a question of force,
A metaphysical law,
We've had this battle a thousand times,
Never been here before,
Never been here before.

Ain't got the strength to fight anymore,
Got no desire to die anymore,
I need an affirmation
I want to see you again, again, again...
Ain't't got the strength to fight anymore,
Don't even know what I'm fighting you for
I need an affirmation

We're at the end of the line
At the start of the race
I want to swim where the water falls
Off the edge of your face
I'm reaching out for the light
Past the silhoutte of you
In the cold reflection of time
It's a point of view
It's a point of view
Can you see me like I see you

Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Got no desire to die anymore
I need an affirmation
I want to see you again, again, again...
Ain't got the strength to fight anymore
Don't even know what I'm fighting you for
I need an affirmation

I wanna fill you with love
I wanna see you survive
Just a second to know yourself
For the rest of your life
We're just a minute away
From the place that we wanna be
We're not really falling apart; we're just incomplete
We're not really falling apart; we're just incomplete
We're just incomplete
We're just incomplete

I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I need an affirmation
I wanna see you again, again, again, again, again
