Song:

Written by Ronan Keating and John O'Kane

If I had the power
No one would ever hurt you
You'd never cry, or ask yourself why
All of your dreams would come true

If my prayers were answered
You'd have all you ever need
You'd never doubt love was about
I'd leave the world at your feet

But I don't have
The world to give
No hidden power,
No precious gifts
To show my love

Chorus:
All I have is my heart
All I can give you is that
All the love in my heart

If I could have one wish
You'd live your life in peace
You'd always know wherever you go
How good it feels to be free

But I can't think that wish comes true
But if I could I promise you
I'd change the world

Chorus:
All I have is my heart
All I can give you is that
All I have is my heart
All the love in my heart

Hold on, hold on
Try to be strong
Life will go on
And you know I'll be there

All I have is my heart
All I have is my heart
All I have is my heart
All I can give is that
All I have is my heart
Just like you, just one heart
All the love in my heart

If I had the power
No one would ever hurt you
