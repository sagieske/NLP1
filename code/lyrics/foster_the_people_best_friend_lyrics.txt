Song:

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
It comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Feelings sleeping in the field again,
But I can feel, I can feel
I can feel, it's beginning to end

Premonitions smiling in the dark
I can see, I can see
I can see the story starting to arc

Ohhh Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh

It's dries up
I've been a spoken word
I've been a river bed
I've been a rabid force
And let it flow up from within

Sometimes it feels like I only dream in black and white

Ahhh, Ahhhh, Ahhhhhh, Ahhhhh
And colors so…

(When your best friends all strung out)
You'll do everything you can
'Cause you're never gonna let it get 'em down
(When you find it all around)
You said it's what you need
And hide your eyes when you're close to me
(When you feel up in the clouds)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

Waits, and fed us, slipping into dreams
Oh, I can feel, I can feel
I can feel the celestial beings

Oh welted pleasures leaving with the breath
I can see, I can see
I can see the beauty in the mask

Ohhh, Ohhhh, Ohhhh, Ohhh

It draws up
I've been a river bed
I tried to salt the wound
I've carried more than I can
I feel I've got a lot to prove
Sometimes I feel like I only dream in black and white

Ohhh, Ohhh, Ohhhh, Ohhh
But colors so….

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You'll do everything you can
Cause you're never gonna let it get em down
(You find it all around)
Yeah, you say it's what you need
And hide your eyes when you're close to me
(With your feet up in the clouds)
You oughta know
That I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head hanging upside-down)
Well, it comes in waves, but it's hardest from the start

I am here no matter where you are
So let it in with, open arms, no matter where you are
Sometimes, you have to wait until it passes by like a satellite or star
No matter where you are

(When your best friend's all strung out)
You know it
Ooh-hoooo-hooooo
(With your feet up in the clouds)
Oh, Yeah, you know when
Ooh-hoooo-Ooh hooooo

(When your best friend's all strung out)
Oh, yeah, you know when
You oughta know
That I'm here no matter where you go
(With your head, hanging upside-down)
Oh yeah, you know it
That's how you know
That your best friend's all strung out
