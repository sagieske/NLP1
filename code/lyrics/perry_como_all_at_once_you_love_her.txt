Song:

You start to light her cigarette
And all at once you love her
You've scarcely talked
You've scarcely met
But all at once you love her

You like her eyes, you tell her so
She thinks you're wise and clever
You kiss goodnight and then you know
You'll kiss goodnight forever

You wonder where your heart can go
Then all at once you know
(All at once you know)

You like her eyes (like her eyes)
You tell her so (tell her so)
She thinks you're wise and clever
(You're wise and clever)

You kiss goodnight and then you know
You'll kiss goodnight forever
You wonder where your heart can go
Then all at once you know
(All at once you know)
