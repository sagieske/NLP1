Song:

When I breathe, and breathe into you
And I feel right to the bone
And I give what you give 
And we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks in the walls covered up by the sheets
We live underneath
All the sex, all the nights, we stay up, yeah we stuck
But we're morning free

Uh ah, uh ah, 
Got the world in our hand like a land
Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love
Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love

I can feel that you feel what I feel and I feel that all in your hands
What we touch is too much and you making me move
And I'll make you dance
Going body to body for good saying nobody gets it right
We don't plan, we don't get, got the fume and the flame
We don't let it die

Uh ah, uh ah, 
Got the world in our hand like a land
Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love
Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love

Perfect like a picture, I know we are one and the same
Perfect like a picture, even when they look through the grains

Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love
Good enough to make the ocean like it's a pond
Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops
And we live like legends now, know that will never die
And we got love, we got love
