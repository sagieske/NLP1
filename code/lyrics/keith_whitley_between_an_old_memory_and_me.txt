Song:

I was sittin' at a table at a little club downtown
Playin' songs on the jukebox and pourin' whisky down
When I heard a sweet voice saying would you like some company
And I had to tell her this is just between an old memory and me.

All my friends tell me I'm a fool for holding on
I know they're tryin' to help me but I've been a fool too long
I don't want to talk about it so why can't they just let me be
Can't they see this is just between an old memory and me.

I'm not hurtin' anybody as far as I can see
I just need to be alone sometimes
While she goes walking through my mind.

I don't want to talk about it so why can't everybody see
This is just between and old memory and me.

This is just between her memory and me...
