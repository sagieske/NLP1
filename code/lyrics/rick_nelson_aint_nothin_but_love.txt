Song:

It ain't nothin' but love, it ain't nothin' but love
Can you feel your heart skip a little beat
It ain't nothin' but love
Do you feel kinda dizzy when you stand on your feet?
It ain't nothin' but love

When she holds your hand do you feel real funny
Do you lose your head when she calls you honey?
Well, don't worry 'bout a thing now
It ain't nothin' but love, it ain't nothin' but love

Can you feel your head spinnin' all around?
It ain't nothin' but love
And you feel like you're flyin' with your feet on the ground
It ain't nothin' but love

Do you walk her home with your arm around her?
Then you think she's sweet but you're glad you found her
Well, don't worry bout a thing now

It ain't nothin' but love, it ain't nothin' but love
Ain't nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love
When you feel like everything's upside down
It ain't nothing but love

When you kiss her goodnight 37 times
That ain't nothin' but love
And you feel kind of funny when the wedding bells chime
That ain't nothin' but love

Do you feel real good every time you kiss her?
And if you left her now do you think you'd miss her
Well, don't worry bout a thing now
That ain't nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love

It ain't nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love
When you feel like every thing's upside down
It ain't nothin' but love

When you kiss her goodnight 37 times
That ain't nothin' but love
And you feel kind of funny when the wedding bells chime
That ain't nothin' but love

Do you feel real good every time you kiss her?
And if you left her now do you think you'd miss her
Well don't worry bout a thing now
That ain't nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love

Ain't nothin' but love, that ain't nothin' but love
Um, nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love
Ain't nothin' but love, ain't nothin' but love
Well, nothin' but love
