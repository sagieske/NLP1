Song:

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's yo birthday
'Cause you know we don't give a f**k
It's not your birthday!

[Chorus:]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

[Verse:]
When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club
N****s heard I f**k with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna f**k
But homie ain't nothing change ho's down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that n***a roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood, in L. A. They saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

[Chorus:]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

[Bridge:]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look n***a I done came up and I ain't change.

[Verse 2:]
And you should love it, way more then you hate it
N***a you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot a** n***a trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya b***h, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the m**********r burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the n****s hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we f*****g be

[Chorus:]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed

You can find me in the club, bottle full of Bud
Mama, I got that X, if you into takin' drugs
I'm into having s**, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into getting rubbed
