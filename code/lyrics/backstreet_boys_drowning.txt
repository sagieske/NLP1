Song:

Brian:
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
Girl you leave me breathless
But it's okay 'cause
You are my survival
Now hear me say
Howie:
I can't imagine life
Without your love
Even forever don't seem
Like long enough
[Chorus:]
'Cause everytime I breathe
I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me
Drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
Brian:
You keep me
Drowning in your love

Aj:
Maybe I'm a drifter
But maybe not
'Cause I have longed the safety
Of running freely
In your arms
And I don't need another life line
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh can't you see
Nick:
I can't imagine life
Without your love
And even forever don't seem
Like long enough
Brian:
(Don't seem like long enough girl)

[Chorus:]
'Cause everytime I breathe
I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me
Drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it
You keep me
Drowning in your love

Kevin:
Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air
That I breathe

[Chorus:]
Everytime I breathe
I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me
Drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
And baby I can't help it
You keep me
Drowning your

Brian: love...

Baby I can't help it
Nick;
Keep me drowning
In your love
Aj: Oh, got me drowning, keep me drowning in your love
Nick:
Baby I can't help it
Can't help it no, no

[Chorus:]
'Cause everytime I breathe
I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it (Brian: baby I can't help it)
You keep me
Drowning in your love
Everytime I try to rise above
(Brian: I'm swept away by love)
Baby I
Aj:
Can't help it
You keep me
Drowning in your love
