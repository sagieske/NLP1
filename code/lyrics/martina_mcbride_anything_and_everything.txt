Song:

What do you dream about
Look at the stars, honey
All you gotta do is pick one out
And it's there for you
I'll be the one who makes
Your every dream come true

Close your eyes and baby
Make a wish and baby
I'll give you anything and everything
The sky's the limit and my heart is in it
I'll give you anything and everything
Anything and everything

Where do you want to go
Look at the world, baby
All you gotta do is just say so
And I'll take you there
Oh yeah, you know that
Love can take you anywhere

Close your eyes and baby
Make a wish and baby
I'll give you anything and everything
The sky's the limit and my heart is in it
I'll give you anything and everything
Anything and everything

I could spoil you
Make it easy
Make you happy if you let me
Won't you let me

I'll be the one who makes
Your every dream come true

Close your eyes and baby
Make a wish and baby
I'll give you anything and everything
The sky's the limit and my heart is in it
I'll give you anything and everything
(I'll give you) anything and everything
(I'll give you) anything and everything
(I'll give you anything and everything)
