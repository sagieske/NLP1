Song:

There's nothing I won't try
Just to make you mine
To get a little closer
Would be so divine

And everytime I see you
You make me come undone
I always want you near me
In you I found the one

Chorus:
Oh, why don't you smile my only star
Shine on baby
Smile, my only star
Smile, my only star
(2x)

With you by my side
Girl it feels so right
Now that I'm close to you
I could stay all night

No matter where I go
No matter what I do
In the end just smile
Bring me back to you

Chorus:
Oh, why don't you smile my only star
Shine on baby
Smile, my only star
Smile, my only star
(2x)

You shine so true
I can't believe your mine
Everything may change
But to me you'll always shine

Chorus:
Oh, why don't you smile my only star
Shine on baby
Smile, my only star
Smile, my only star
(2x)
