Song:

Break free!

Through every bone I break, through every word you say, you're just another enemy.
Right now, get away from me.
You won't, get the best of me.
I can't stop or slow down, I never have and I never will.
I never will!

You won't break me!
Or silence this heartbeat, your words, they mean nothing.
I will break free!
From walls that surround me, I'm sick of this feeling.
I will break free from you!

You're just a cloud of smoke, another empty soul, you're just another snake in my way.
You're just a cloud of smoke, another empty soul,
I see it in your face, you're just a snake in my way.
Right now, get away from me.
You won't, get the best of me.
I can't stop or slow down, I never have and I never will.
I never will!

You won't break me!
Or silence this heartbeat, your words, they mean nothing.
I will break free!
From walls that surround me, I'm sick of this feeling

You won't break me,
I will break free.
You won't break me,
I will break free from you!

You won't hold me.
Right now, you won't and I can't,
You won't hold me!
You won't break me!
(Get away from me, get the best of me.)
You won't hold me down!

You won't break me!
Or silence this heartbeat, your words, they mean nothing.
I will break free!
From walls that surround me, I'm sick of this feeling

You won't break me,
I will break free.
You won't break me!
