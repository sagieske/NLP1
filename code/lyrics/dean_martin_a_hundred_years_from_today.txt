Song:

Don't save your kisses just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logically sound
Who's gonna know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today

Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on mother earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today

So laugh and sing
Make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one
Beneath the sun who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember darling we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today

The moon is shining and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember darling we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
A hundred years from today

Today
