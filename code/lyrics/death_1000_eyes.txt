Song:

Crossing the line into the other side
Emerging as prisoners
To the emptiness of the time
To the left and to the right
From behind - They're out of sight

Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A world-wide, foolproof cage

Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew
Living in the pupil of 1, 000 eyes

Was it overlooked in front of all our faces?
Now, the mistakes and secrets
Cannot be erased

Viewing the blind complexity
By which laws were justified
To erase simplicity

To the left and to the right
From behind, they're out of sight

Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A world-wide, foolproof cage
Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
To those who never knew
Among many to be passed down

Living in the pupil of 1, 000 eyes(echo)
We are enslaved now
