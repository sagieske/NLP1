Song:

All alone in your bedroom
And the wind outside howls and moans
Restless sleep toss and turning
And the clock chimes

Ohhh twelve midnight at the garden
And I float like a leaf down your heart
My heart by your doorway
Why I can sense your skin start to crawl

I'm a gypsy spirit
Dude, you'd better feel it
Ahhhhh! 
Tramples at your soul

Wide awake, start shiverin'
And the cold chills your bones
Beads of sweat on your forehead
Something tells you you're not alone

Ohhhh now's the time you've been dreadin'
Superstitious fears start to spread
Squeaking floor so close behind you
I show myself 

I'm a gypsy spirit
Dude, you'd better feel it
Ahhhhh! 
Tramples at your soul
Soul! Soul! Soul! 

Screaming out you announce me
Closet walls of your room
Lay on back you can't fight it
Tonight's the night I seal your doom

Ohhhh Now
And the face she sees is the same
Let's leap out the highest window
And leave a note saying you're to blame

I'm a gypsy spirit
Dude, you'd better feel it
Ahhhhh! 
Tramples at your soul
