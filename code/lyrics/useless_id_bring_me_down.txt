Song:

Everyone gather round, the fight's about to begin.
It's me against the whole wide world knowing there's no way I could win.
It's been a while since I could come up with anything new
And make it seem alright.
You know it's never been.

Once agian (ohohoh).
I need to run away (ohoh) from everyone all around,
Until it stops bringing me down.

Remember all the days we had to figure out what we want
But, now those days have passed me by.
Why is it so hard to get around?
I'm losing all control over myself and I'm down to the floor.
Now, I don't even know who am I talking to anymore.

Once again (ohohoh).
I need to run away (ohoh) from everyone all around,
Until it stops bringing me down!

Once agian (ohohohoh).
I need to run away (ohoh) from everyone all around, until it stops...
