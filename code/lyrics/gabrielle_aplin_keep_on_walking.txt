Song:

Something's happening, you can see
(On your way, go on your way)
We are rolling on stormy seas
(On your way, go on your way)
You call up and then disagree
The lies you're spinning are changing me.

All the glitter is not gold
From the bruises flowers grow

I feel so much better now you're not around
There's no one to kick me while I'm down
No one to burn my bridges any more
So keep on walking, 

Cause I'm not here to make you feel good, 
To dry up your tears and apologise for you.
I feel so much better now you're not around, 
So keep on walking

You've been whispering way too long
(On your way, go on your way)
You don't say sorry, you're far too proud
(On your way, go on your way)

All the glitter is not gold
I stayed up to watch you go
I feel so much better now you're not around
There's no one to kick me while I'm down
No one to burn my bridges any more
So keep on walking, 

Cause I'm not here to make you feel good, 
To dry up your tears and apologise for you
I feel so much better now you're not around
So keep on walking, 

You know I'm happy now
