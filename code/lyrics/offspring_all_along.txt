Song:

Deep inside I seek what's burning
Should have known all the while what's true
Went along, to fool myself
Can't go on, I can't escape it

All along
Think I'm really new
It was down in the words I've spoken
All along
Still believe in you
Now believe we are betrayed and broken

Close my eyes from the burning
All along, all the while it's true
Take it on, turn your back
Either way, you can't escape it

All along
Think I'm really new
It was down in the words I've spoken
All along
Still believe in you
Now believe we are betrayed and broken

Ohhh ohhh oh oh oh

All along
Think I'm really new
It was down in the words I've spoken
All along
Still believe in you
Now believe we are betrayed and broken

All along, I still believe in you
