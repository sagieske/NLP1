Song:

Don't you know I need you
Only you I will obey
Don't you know I need you
It makes me wanna stay

It's if something I imagined,
Since something that I can't explain
I can't beat your energy
Directed to my brain

Don't you know I need you
Only you I will obey
Don't you know I need you
It makes me wanna stay

I wish I could meet anyone
Before it seems insane
And even when they tell me I got more to lose
Than I gotta get a gain

Don't you know I need you
Only you I will obey
Don't you know I need you
It makes me wanna stay
Ya stay..

Lead me to your temple
Lead me to your door
I'll see it for the first sometime
Like I've never seen before

Don't you know I need you
Only you I will obey
Don't you know I need you
It makes me wanna stay
I need you
I, I need you
