Song:

I know it's hard to reach you
I know It's hard to breathe
I know it's hard to be you sometimes
I can imagine what that means
It must someoneelse's story
I can follow what you played
...
My suppose to understand
Like a ship on the ocean
Hanging out to see
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
A lot like me

Used to look for redemption
Still can't find a place
If there's nothing else after
There be no saving Grace
I'll give you control now
I need some kind of sign
Can't take away the sorrow now
I'll give you all that's mine

Like a ship on the ocean
Hanging out to see
You can hardly see it now
It's a lot like you
A lot like me

Like a ship on the ocean
...
It's a lot like you
A lot like me
