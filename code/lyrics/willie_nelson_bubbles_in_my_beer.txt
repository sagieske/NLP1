Song:

Tonight in the bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheer
Scenes from the past rise before me
Watchin' the bubbles in my beer

(Chorus:)
Visions of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
And I know that my life's been a failure
Watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seeing the road that I travel
A road filled with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
Watchin' the bubbles in my beer

(Repeat chorus)

(As Performed by Ray Price on
"San Antonio Rose - A Tribute To The Great Bob Wills)

Tonight in a bar room I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheer
The scenes of my life pass before me
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

Chorus:
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone, silent tear to my eye
I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer

I'm seein' the road that I travel
A road paved with heartaches and tears
I'm seein' the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer

Chorus:
I think of the heart that I've broken
And the golden chances that have passed me by
The dreams I once made now are over
As empty as the bubbles in my beer
