Song:

One single grain of sand
Just broke the camel's back
One final fleck of down
Was enough to make it crack
It didn't hardly weigh a thing
But it might have been a ton
For the animal's all in
Too much damage has been done
So I'm giving you my notice
And it works this way
In two weeks time you will notice I've been gone
For fourteen days
You don't know what it's like
To be left out in the cold
To feel all alone
Even when there's a party going on
Well it's been like this for me
For too, too long
So I won't even get my things
Lord it's down the road I'm going
So I'm giving you my notice
And it works this way
In two weeks time you will notice I've been gone
For fourteen days
So I'm giving you my notice
And it works this way
In two weeks time you will notice I've been gone
For fourteen days
