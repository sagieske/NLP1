Song:

Keeps coming closer, I don‘t but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type, amnesia, that’s over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I don’t care
My whole memory of me and I’ve gone so far from me, girl
It’s not fair
I could feel it almost starts to change
But then it hurts too much, that’s when it starts to fade

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?, don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia! Every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No 'we' anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

[Verse 2:]
Now peace for those of us
Some have peace on inner
Tell me what happened?
Who they? Where did they go?
And was he enough, enough?
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me is now gone so far from me, it's not fair
And I can feel it almost start to change
But it just hurts too much, I let it go away

[Chorus:]
So cold baby, now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?, don’t you think I would know?
Amnesia! Every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No 'we' anymore, she’s a stranger that I used to know

I could feel it almost starts to change
But then it hurts too much, I let it go away

[Bridge:]
So cold baby (so cold), now I’m going crazy
I don’t know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don’t you think?, don’t you think I would know?

I got amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No 'we' anymore she’s a stranger
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it’s gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No 'we' anymore she’s a stranger that I used to know
And I don’t know you anymore
Everything and nothing
Everything and nothing
She’s a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot, who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see you
Thought I could do without ya
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind, some kind of amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
Thought I could do without ya
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind, some kind of amnesia, amnesia
Memories fade away
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot whop we are
I’ll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn’t this love insane, insane? Yeah...
