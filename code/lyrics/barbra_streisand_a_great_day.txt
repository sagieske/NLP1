Song:

Fanny & chorus
When you're down and out
Lift up your head and shout
There's gonna be a great day
Angels in the sky
Promise that be by and by
There's gonna be a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn
You will hear his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
Great day

When you're down and out
Lift up your head en shout
There's gonna be a great day
Angels in the sky
Promise that by en by
We're gonna see a great day
Gabriel will warn you
Somebody born
You will hear his horn, his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great day
When the skies went darker, oh lord!
Came noah's ark, oh lord!
Amen and amen!
Amen and amen!

He came in january, february, march, april, may, june
July, and august, september october, november,
De de december
It was a great day
It was a great day
One of those great days
And on judgment day
If you believe he will receive you and me
Gabriel will warn you
Some early morn
You will his horn, his horn
It's not far away
Lift up your head and say
There's gonna be a great
We're gonna see a great

Be a great day.
