Song:

My head bowed down
As I walked through the projects
Sirens till ringing in my ears
Heavy of heart
'Till something twitched in the gutter
An angel lay there soaked in her own
And she spoke...
She said, "My name is Mary"
She asked me if I'd like to take her home
A glass eye and a toothless grin
She took my hand and led me to salvation
