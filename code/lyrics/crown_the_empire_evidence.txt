Song:

This is the road I chose,
This is the life I've made.
Say what you want,
But know this world opened her arms for me.
I write these words in blood,
I write these words for you.
This world deserves to finally know the...

Your arrogance blinds you.
Why don't you open your mind,
And listen to the words that could save your life?
We all grow tired of what we think we know,
But at the end of the day, we have to choose where our paths go.

Decide at the fork in the road.
Decide at the fork in the road!

Just so know you'll never go under.
(Please tell me, please tell me)
Please try and tell me I'm wrong!

[Chorus:]
You say we follow along.
Well, now follow along to these words I say,
They're all I have,
To open the door that could never be cracked.
Please try and tell me I'm wrong,
And say I'll never belong cause all your hate
Won't wear me down,
I'll still be the last one left wearing the crown.

You think we're hopeless and lost,
You think we're just fucking pawns.
But we will never be,
No, we will never be!

I lie awake and dream of how we will change the world
(Change the world!)
It's up to us to fill in the cracks,
And bring this world back to what it could have been.

It's up to us, it's up to us!

[Chorus:]
You say we follow along.
Well, now follow along to these words I say,
They're all I have,
To open the door that could never be cracked.
Please try and tell me I'm wrong,
And say I'll never belong cause all your hate
Won't wear me down,
I'll still be the last one left wearing the crown.

You'll never find happiness while you live inside hate.
Yeah!

I write these words in blood,
I write these words for you.
This world deserves to finally know the truth.

This is the road I chose,
This is the life I've made.
Say what you want,
But know this world opened her arms for me.
