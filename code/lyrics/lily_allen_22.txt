Song:

When she was 22 the future looked bright
But she's nearly 30 now
And she's out every night
I see that look in her face
She's got that look in her eye
She's thinking how did I get here
And wondering why

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up
And puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

She's got an alright job
But it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it,
It brings her to tears
Cause all she wants is a boyfriend
She gets one-night stands
She's thinking how did I get here
I'm doing all that I can

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up
And puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

It's sad but it's true how society says
Her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Til the man of her dreams comes along picks her up
And puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age
