Song:

If ever I need you dear
I find your love is gone
Sign on the dotted line
And try to take it home

I left my lamp a-burning
I left the front door open wide
No sleep come the morning
Wore it out with the tears I cried

Chorus:
Are you gonna be my angel?
The Devil's never gonna let me save my poor soul

[ Chorus (x2) ]

Shovel that shines like silver
Digs a hole in the ground
The gold ring that I gave you
I found it laying 'round

The hole ate up my mind
The hole ate up my heart
Your name's still on my lips
When I whisper in the dark

[ Chorus (x4) ]
