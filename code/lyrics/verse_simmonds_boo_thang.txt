Song:

Ok, This s**t is so random,
And when I'm with you
It's like our heart beats, are in tandem,
And when our lips lock,
I just wanna hold your face for ransom.
You're beautiful and I'm handsome,
That'll be good for the babies
If ever we go there maybe!
It's crazy, no titles but your my baby,
When I'm idle that's your time,
Show time, and for you, I wish I had more time.
Red wine, chocolate,
Baby you could be my Valentine.
More than just s** exchanged, baby you my Boo Thang.

Hey, girl, so glad that I've found ya!
Uh huh! Tell your friends, they're leaving without ya!
Got a hotel room with a view of the city that I know you gonna like,
Got the candles leading to the bathtub baby, let's hop inside!
Ride in the two door with the roof gone.
My oh my, baby it's been too long
So grab your coat and your purse,
I'll walk out of here first,
Wait about five and I'll be parked outside!

Bridge:
I know we aint got no strings attached,
But this could be a perfect match!
And girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that!

Chorus:
You're my boo thang,
Can't get enough, I love yo stuff!
Let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause you're my boo thang
And when your friends ask,
I'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!
To a boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang!

Hey, girl, I can't leave here without you, uh huh!
And how you're looking I love everything about you!
Girl it's more then your body, I'm making love to your mind
And every time that I want you,
You're ready all of the time!

Bridge:
I know we ain't got no strings attached,
But this could be a perfect match!
And girl, we ain't no cuddie buddies
Cause this is way more than that!

Chorus:
You're my boo thang,
Can't get enough, I love you, stuff!
Let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause you're my boo thang
And when your friends ask,
I'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!
To a boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang!

Baby turn the lights off,
All I wanna do is touch you!
We can make a movie, baby
Nobody do it like us two!
Yeah, boy put your hands all on my body
Ride that thang just like a harley. So come on let's get it started!
Turn the Lights off! Baby, turn the lights off!
Baby, turn the lights off! Just turn the lights off!

(Talking)
Turn the lights off baby
I need you to follow my lead
I wanna make you feel good
I wanna make you feel like you've never felt before
Can I do that? Boo vision

Chorus:
You're my boo thang,
Can't get enough, I love you, stuff!
Let's turn it up, you get what you want
Cause you're my boo thang
And when your friends ask,
I'm not ya man just the closest thing that you have!
To a boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang,
Boo thang, boo thang!
