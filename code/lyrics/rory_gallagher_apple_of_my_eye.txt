With The Traits

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to move away
Though inside my heart, I really want to stay
Believe the love we have is so sincere
You know, the gift you have will always be

Chorus
You're the apple of my eye
You're the apple of my heart
But now, the time has come to part

Oh, I'm sorry, but it's time to make a stand
Though we never meant to bite the lovin hand
And now, the time has come to walk alone
We were the children, now weve overgrown

Chorus

Repeat verse 1

Chorus

Now, the time has come to part
Now, the time has come to part.
