Song:

We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
O Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
O Lord we cast down our idols

Give us clean hands give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another

O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob
O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob

We bow our heart and we bend our knees
O Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil tings
O Lord we cast down our idols

So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts
Let us no tlift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another

O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob
O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob

So give us clean hands and give us pure heart
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another

O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob
[acapella]
O God let us be a generation that seeks
That seeks Your face, O God of Jacob

So give us clean hands, give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Give us clean hands, O God,
Give us pure hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
