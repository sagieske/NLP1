Song:

A company,
Always on the run.
A destiny,
Towards the rising sun.
I was born six-gun in my hand,
Behind a gun, I'll make my final stand.
That's why they call me...
Bad Company. I can't deny,
Bad Company, until the day I die. until the day I die. until the day I die...

Rebel souls. Deserters we've been called,
Chose a gun and threw away the sun.
Now these towns, they all know our name.
Six gun sound is our claim to fame.
I can hear them say...
Bad Company, and I won't deny.
Bad. Bad Company, until the day I die. until the day I die...

Hey hey, Bad Company, I can't deny...
Bad Company, until the day I die.
It's Bad Company. Oh yeah yeah.
Bad Company, until the day I die.

(Subdued vocal during the outro lead)
Till the day I die Oh Yeah Tell me that you are not a thief
Oh But I am
Bad Company
It's the way I play
Dirty for dirty
Oh Somebody Double-crossed me
Double-cross
Double-cross
Yeah
We're Bad company
Kill in cold blood
