a. GUAVA JELLY

Baby, I really, really love you now.
I think you should stop your cryin';
Here my kerchief to dry your eyes,
You know that I love you, yea-eah-eah.
Groovy; here I am:
Come rub it 'pon me belly
Like a guava jelly.
Damsel, here I stand:
Come rub it 'pon me belly
Like-a guava jelly.

b. THIS TRAIN

This train - mm - mm - mm;
This train is bound to glory - this train;
Talkin' 'bout ma: this train is bound to glory - this train:
This train is bound to glory,
This train carry no un'oly;
This train - I'm a-talkin' 'bout: this train.

When I was just a kid,
My mommy used to sing this song.
Now I've grown to be a man,
Well, it still lingers deep down in my soul;
I said, it still lingers deep down in my soul.

I'm talkin' 'bout: this train is bound to glory - this train;
This train is bound to glory - this train;
This train is bound to glory,
O dis 'ere train carry no un'oly.
This train - I'm a-talkin' 'bout: this train.

c. CORNERSTONE

The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone-a;
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone.

You're a builder, baby;
Here I am, a stone.
Don't you pick and refuse me,
'Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should choose.
Do you 'ear me? Hear what I say!

Stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone-a;
The stone that the builder refuse, yeah! -
Will always be the head cornerstone.

You're a builder, baby;
Wo, here I am, a stone!
Don't you pick and refuse me,
'Cause the t'ings people refuse
Are the things they should use;
The things people refuse
Are the things they should use.
Do you 'ear me? Hear what I say!

Stone dat them builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone-a;
The stone that dem builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone.

d. COMMA COMMA

Comma, comma, come back here,
My-y young lady;
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
My-y young lady, yeah!
Jus' while I thought
Everything was running smooth,
She left me
While I was in the mood.
Now I'm callin' to you,
But my world is relying for you to:

Comma, comma, come back here,
My-y young lady, yeah!
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
My-y young lady!
Jus' while I thought
Everything was running smooth.
You know I love you;
Oh now I love you. /fadeout/

e. DEWDROPS

Mm-mm-hm.
I've been searchin' the whole darn day
For a little woman of mine - mine - mine - mine.
Someone a-told me I could find her here,
But it seem she disappear.
Said, I searched the whole darn day;
Night is drawing nigh.
I t'ink I'd better go home;
Try tomorrow again.

But when I reached that railroad station,
I missed the last train,
And then it seemed like dewdrops
Gonna fall on me;
Yes, it seem like teardrops
Gonna call on me now.

I said, I'd better make up my mind
What am I gonna do.
Am I gonna rest up here,
Or am I gonna push on through?

My mind say, "Hey, man, ya hit the road."
Down there I missed the track - track - track;
I'm lost! Lord, I'm lost, eh!
Love is such a heavy load!

And then: for crying out loud, come back to me!
For crying out loud, hear my plea!
For crying out loud, come back to me!
Why do you treat me so bad?
Why do you treat me so bad?
Mm - mm - mm - mm - bam, bam.
Bom, bom, bome, bome.

f. STIR IT UP

Let's stir it up!
Stir it up, little darlin';
Stir it up. Yaga, yaga.
Little darlin', stir it up. Mm.
Little darlin'.

It's been a long, long time
Since I've got you on my mind, o-oh.
Now you are here
It's so clear:
See what we could do,
Just you and me, yea-eah!

Let's stir it up!
Little darlin', stir it up!
Oh, come on, woman!
Little darlin', come on! Stir it up. ...
Little darlin'.

I'll push the wood, blaze the fire;
Satisfy your heart desire.
I'll a-stir it, yeah - every minute, yeah!
All you got to do, honey, Keep it in it.

Let's stir it up!
Little darlin', let's stir it up!
Little darlin', stir it up!
Oh, wo - wo - wo - wo-ah, li'l darlin'. Lead up now.

g. I'M HURTING INSIDE

When I was just a little child,
'Appiness was there awhile.
Then from me it slipped one day:
'Appiness, come back, I say,
'Cause if you don't come - come,
I go looking, yeah! -
For 'appiness.
'Cause if you don't come - come,
I go looking now! -
For 'appiness.

Then together like school children,
Then your hurt was just in vain.
Lord, I'm your weary child:
'Appiness, come back. Oh, I -
'Cause if you don't come
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness.
And if you don't come,
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness.
Like Jah said, I'm a-hurtin' inside;
I'm a-hurtin' inside.
