Song:

It's two A. M. In my new home this motel room
An ash tray full of lucky strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Lite
Counting regrest... Fighting back tears
Retracin' steps... Gettin' nowhere

[Chorus:]
Callin' your name it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this empty bed
Stirrin' up ash's, tryin' to find passion
Where there's no love left
It's like tryin to put smoke back in this cigarette

Come sunrise guess I'll check out and ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' till I finally mend this broken trust
Hangin' my hopes on highway signs
If I lie here I'll lose my mind

[Repeat Chorus]

I may never know your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good in your goodbye

[Repeat Chorus]
