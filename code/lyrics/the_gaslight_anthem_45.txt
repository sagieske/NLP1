Song:

Have you seen my hands?
Just look at 'em shake.
And the song just keeps on repeating,
Drop the needle again.
And I dance with your ghost,
Oh, but that ain't the way...
I can't move on and I can't stay the same.

And all my friends say...

"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet. "

Have you seen my heart,
Have you seen how it bleeds?
And the nights are so long, baby,
Out here in the deep.
The tick, ticking of hours, lonely.
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms.

But "better sense" says...

"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet. "

And all my friends say,
"Hey hey, turn the record over.
Hey hey, and I'll see you on the flip side.
There you go, turn the key and engine over.
Let her go, let somebody else lay at her feet. "

Where you used to be... Here with me.
