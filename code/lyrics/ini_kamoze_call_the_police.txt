Song:

Calling all stars, calling all stars
This is an emergency
There is a crucial jam at the corner of are and B
Proceed with caution
Suspects are musically armed and dangerous

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Jump off ma stool outta ma corner
May I have the floor to say
I play the fool to catch the wiser
Now I've gotta motto that guilty must pay

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit, hey, hey, hey, hey
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Don't single me out as worst offender
My words and my actions are clear
We analyze like a computer
Set for the evil men conscience in fear

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit, yea, yea
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Call the police, police, police
Police, police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit

Calling all stars, calling all stars
This is an

Jump off ma stool, outa ma corner
May I have the floor to say
I play the fool to catch the wiser
Now I've gotta motto that guilty must pay

I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
