Song:

I'm going out to damage my brain
You wont come you sya your staying at home
Its no shame
Night and day
We see each other anyway
Weve got to move weve got to get away
Its a long cold night but there's a better day
Wouldnt you say correct me if I'm wrong
We've got all the good reasons for time on our own

You see me all of the time
And you see me all of the time
And you see me all of the time
Hey throw me some line

Its him and her
Its this and that
I feel my tyre goin flat
There's no get up and go for gettin it on
We've got all the good reasons for time on our own

You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
I said hey hey throw me some line

You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
I said hey hey throw me some line

No no
No don't you throw me that line
Ahh no no
No don't you throw me that line
No no
No don't you throw me that line
Because I don't wanna hear about it
I don't want to here about it
I don't want to here about it
I don't want to here about it

You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
You see me all of the time
I said hey hey throw me some line
