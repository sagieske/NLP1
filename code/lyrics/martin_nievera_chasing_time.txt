Song:

Ten minutes to morning
A new day begun Aaaahhhh
All memories behind me
Chasing the sun Aaaahhhh

If I could do over, turn back the hands of time
I'd know I've been there before
Crumbled up pages, stories untold
Words with no wisdom no more

I'm chasing time, can't look behind
All broken dreams in my lifetime
Why's the sunset fading
I'm chasing time, hoping to find
Reachable dreams in far places
No more empty spaces
Is this time mine - I'm chasing time

Falling down on my face
No scars - not a trace Aaaahhhh
Been down all the same roads
Still lost - can't find my way Aaaahhhh

Traveling down the highway sometimes I'm in reverse
Passing all the signs that go by
Which can lead the right way? Can I get there first?
I think I'm finally losing my mind

I'm chasing time, can't look behind
All broken dreams in my lifetime
Why's the sunset fading
I'm chasing time, hoping to find
Reachable dreams in far places
No more empty spaces
Is this time mine - I'm chasing time

Sometimes i don't know
Am I chasing time? Im not in control
But now I can see, now I believe
Its really time chasing me!

Piense-en mi y para siempre
Sueno en ti En mis sueno
Se detiente-el tiempo

I'm chasing time, can't look behind
All broken dreams in my lifetime
Why's the sunset fading
I'm chasing time (Persigo Al tiempo), hoping to find (Me sigue)
Reachable dreams in far places (Y pienso y espero y sueno no)
No more empty spaces

The journey begins with you
And I won't stop 'til I am thru

'Cause I'm chasing time
Persigo al tiempo
I'm chasing time
Persigo al tiempo
I'm chasing time!
Persigo al tiempo
