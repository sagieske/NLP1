Song:

I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby for her to stay
Just someone to keep my house clean
Fix my meals and go away

Afraid
A man feels afraid
Afraid

It's hard to make that change
When life and love turn strange and cold

To live a love, you gotta give a love
To give a love, you gotta be part of
And when will I see you again?

A while ago somewhere I don't know when
I was watching a movie with a friend
I fell in love with the actress
She was playing a part I could understand

A maid
Man needs a maid
A maid

I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give

That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwoods
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold

And when will I see you again?
