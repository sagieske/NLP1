Song:

(Verse 1)
The doors open and everybody turns around, 
To see you walk down the aisle in our pretty white gown.
You're holding you daddys arm, your tears begin to fall, 
And both of our lives are about to change forever.
Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand the preacher says, 
We're gathered here today and I... 
(Chorus)
I almost lose it, when I hear you say I do 
And I'm so in love with you, baby
I almost lose it, when I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take.
(Verse 2)
I wonder if she's nervous, or will she get cold feet... 
She wears a smile, as the diamond shines from her wedding ring.
I hope it's everything you wanted, you deserve the best.
Always knew I'd be the reason, for your wedding dress.
So beautiful the way you read your vows, then the wedding bells ring, and
I... 

(Repeat Chorus)

(Breakdown)
As the tears roll down your cheek, it's impossible for me to speak.
My heart is beating fast, and my knees are feeling weak.
So speak now or forever hold your peace.
Can help but one if I must see, if you don't she'll live with me. Nooo
(Chorus)
I almost lose it, when I hear you say I do 
And I'm so in love with you, baby
I almost lose it, when I see that pretty face
It's more than I can take. 

Does he know you were meant for me, do you know?
Can't help but wonder, ya know you were meant for me, girll.
And if you didn't know, you are... you are

I almost lose it...
