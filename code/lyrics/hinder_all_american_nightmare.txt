Song:

(Lets go)
(Nightmare)
(Rock)

Dressed head to toe black on black,
Three bunnies in the back of my Cadillac.
With me it's gonna be a good story to tell;
Cash, grass, and a** on the highway to hell.
Be careful what you wish for when you dream

I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
Nice guys are last 'cause I'm always first.
I'm a freak show sucker for how it feels;
Turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
I'm red white blue tattooed and just don't care;
I'm the all-American nightmare.

If you wanna run away I can give you a ride,
I'm a one way ticket to the darker side.
So come with me, baby lets lose some sleep.
But don't mistake me for a dream.

I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
Nice guys are last 'cause I'm always first.
I'm a freak show sucker for how it feels;
Turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
I'm red white blue tattooed and just don't care;
I'm the all-American nightmare.

They try to lock me up and throw away the key,
But they're never gonna hold down a freak like me.
I'm an outcast, smoking grass living for free,
And I got everything you want,
But nothing that you need.

(Stick to me baby)

(Oh)
I make the good girls bad, and bad girls worse;
Nice guys are last 'cause I'm always first.
I'm a freak show sucker for how it feels;
Turn the girl next door into hell on heels.
I'm red white blue tattooed and just don't care;
I'm the all-American nightmare.

I'm the all-American nightmare
I'm the all-American nightmare
And I've got nothing that you need.
