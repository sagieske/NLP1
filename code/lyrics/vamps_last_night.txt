[Verse:]
I hold my hands up high
And throw my glasses to the sky
But when the morning comes
We'll never see the sun
And if the walls close in
Then let's just start it all again
That's when the evening comes
Oh yeah, the evening comes.

No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it all, do it all
Do it all again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
But my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We have last night

Let's shut this party down
And pull the buildings to the ground
Yeah go let's live it up
One night is all we got

Let's dance until we die,
Nobody's going home tonight,
This kiss could be our last
Come on and raise your glass

No we're not going home tonight
Wake up the stars are shining
We'll do it all, do it all
Do it all again

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
But my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We have last night

We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring you friends, and tell a friend to tell a friend
We do it all again
We do it all again
So by the end of night we still be friends
We do it all again
We do it all again
So bring you friends, and tell a friend to tell a friend
We do it all again
We do it all again
So by the end of night

Wake up in the morning
With the sunlight in my eyes,
But my head don't feel so bright,
What the hell happened last night?

Yeah last night we were dancing
Singing all our favorite songs
Think I might kissed someone
I hope tomorrow never comes
We have last night
