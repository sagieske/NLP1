36-24-36
See a girl walkin' down the street
Just the kind of girl that I'd like to meet
It ain't her hair, her clothes, her feet
Somethin' much more discreet
Now I ain't loud baby I ain't proud
I just want what I'm not allowed
Movin on up & help myself
Do a world of good for my mental health
36-24-36
Something's brookin' that needs to be fixed
I don't know how to tell you this but
I'm getting bored and I need some kicks
Like 36-24-36
Man-o man-o man-o man
I got a red hot plan if you understand
Cannot fail it's plain to see
I'm have'n fun and makin' money
I know this summer's gonna be the best
If I don't die from lack of rest
Experience what my daddy said
That's what I got just like he said
36-24-36
Something was broke but I got it fixed
I don't know if I should tell you this
But I was gettin' bored and I got my kicks
Like 36-24-36
Somethings special 'bout her personality
Somethings special 'bout her psysiology
36-24-36
I want lots of pretty chicks
36-24-36
I want lots of pretty chicks
36-24-36
I want lots of pretty chicks
36-24-36
I want lots of...
