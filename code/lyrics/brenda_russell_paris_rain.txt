Song:

"Slow stroll on a misty night
Hearts soar under Paris lights
And the feeling is strange, as though we've been here before
It's coming to me now

I trip over stepping-stones
That lead to the deep unknown
But here you stand tall as Eiffel's tower
And every hour I'm deeper into

Love and Paris Rain
I could drown inside this interlude of
Love and Paris Rain
Take me now as I unfold my very soul unto you, my love
(I fall deeper)
(Music)

And every hour I'm Deeper into
[Chorus:]

Slow stroll on a misty night
Hearts soar under Paris lights
It's coming to me now

[Chorus:]
Repeat to fade
"
