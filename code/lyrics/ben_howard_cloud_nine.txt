Song:

Shadows on the water,
From a memory that turns inside,
From the last time I saw you happier,
Than I've seen you, than I've seen you in a long time.

And all these faces, oh how they adore you
With every blessing, every strength of the storm.
And it seems to me it all worked out so different
Funny how distance and time they don't change at all.

So may your worries, may your worries
Never fall too loud.
And may you stay here, may you stay here
Happy in your own skin,
On the ninth cloud.

Cold to every warning,
Oh these ships that passed through, years before
And bolder now, than a brand new morning,
With the sun on your face,
The bruise and the breaks of these careless arms.

So hold your body, hold your body
Strong in these winds that blind
And may I find you, may we sit together when we're grey and old,
On cloud nine.

This life will move you with every step outside,
It's alright, it's alright
My arms are open wide for you
This life will move you as graceful as the tide
It's alright, it's alright
Loosen the fears that fears that bind you.
Loosen the fears that fears that bind you.
