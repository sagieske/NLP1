Song:

Stargazing megafast
You hit me like a cosmic blast
You've given me a Technicolor world

Putting me in Overdrive
Speed of light, I'm so alive!
Could you be my supernova girl?

Interplanetary, Megastellar, Hydrostatic
There's no gravity between us
Our love is automatic!

(Zoom Zoom Zoom) Make my heart go
(Boom Boom) My Supernova Girl(x4

Visions of your pretty face
Send me into Hyperspace
Caught up in a planetary whirl

Breathing in, you give me air
I'm living off your solar flare
Could you be my Supernova Girl?

Interplanetary, Megastellar, Hydrostatic
There's no gravity between us
Our love is automatic!

(Zoom Zoom Zoom) Make my heart go
(Boom Boom) My Supernova Girl(x4)

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Interplanetary, Megastellar, Hydrostatic
There's no gravity between us
Our love is automatic!

(Zoom Zoom Zoom) Make my heart go
(Boom Boom) My Supernova Girl(x4
