Shake-a shake-a

All them tricks that these girls do.

Take it to the front while your shaking your back,
Here we go lil mama let me see you work that.
Take it to the front while your shaking your back,
Here we go lil mama, here we go lil mama

I spent my money while your poping that front and bouncing that a**
Doin what they gotta do to get that cash.

But she wide open watch her get loose with it.

Drop that nugget down to the floor
So indeed she with it

Got your a** crunk and they about to pop loose
All them tricks that these girls do.

Take it to the front while your shaking your back,
Here we go lil mama let me see you work that.
Take it to the front while your shaking your back,

Hey girl-ll,

You gotta come over here and get it in quick
Drop that booty to the floor
I make it rain money quick,
I can chain, I can rip.
Girl you know you got the wheels.
I got the dome like buffy,
And she had a white beetle.
In the club, moving fast like a cheetah
Whisper in my ear, drop down on the rim
I'm a beetle.

"Go down", Hell nah
Half way I'll meet yah
Tell yah stomach, I
Got a bag of ticks I'll treat yah
Different colors in my chain, oo
Count thing
People hatin on the count but they won't swing
Stripe clubs ain't nothing but a G' thang
G strings I'll be in and out the chevy man,
I'll be on your body,
Il be register in cities seeing pretty
Bend over touch your toes and get loose with it,

Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy with a new town click.
She fine, she thick, she's always on her s**t
She fine, she thick, she's always on her s**t, "her shit"
Look, beat her, bang her, wang her,
Shorty, shorty, looking like a glacier
Oh man! Hunnie bake, don't bake no shake,
Make them home-girls wait,
This ain't amature nite,
You better get yourself home if your s**t aint tight.
Cool bag of ice, I can
Tell them girls want you,
Look at me, and your time is threw.
This is aint get it back,
Your a little kitty-cat, get it back
Cause you can't get it, where we get it at
Young girls need to stay in the young lane,
So when they wrong, they don't do the wrong thing.
Aint no wrong thing when you in the strip club,
You have to share if ya want it to girl,
Hey this came in the ghetto place!
Oo-oo-oo
Leader's strum aloud,

[Chorus:]
Shake-a shake-a
When she skaking that big cabous.
Got your a** crunk and they about to pop loose
All them tricks that these girls do.
And they go-

Take it to the front while your shaking your back,
Here we go lil mama let me see you work that.
Take it to the front while your shaking your back,
Here we go lil mama, here we go lil mama

[Chorus:]
Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy, big booty judy
Big booty judy with a new town click.
