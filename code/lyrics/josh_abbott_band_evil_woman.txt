Verse 1
I ran into an old girlfriend of mine.
She said "you're looking good, kinda looking fine,"
"and I was thinking maybe after your show,
We could go to my place and see where love goes. "
I looked at her and I said "Baby not tonight."
She asked "Why?" and I said these words come to mind:

Chorus
Be gone evil woman.
Don't come around here with your spell.
Be gone evil woman.
I don't like you in case you couldn't tell.

Verse 2
See that girl, she's standing over there.
She's got the bluest eyes and longest, blondest hair.
I can see the way she looks in her eyes
As she kisses her lips and rubs around her thighs.
I can tell by her face she's ready to go
But tonight girl, tonight I gotta say no
