Song:

Here I am again Lord
Asking for more
Fill me up completely
With the anointing oil
Not only my head
But every part of me
I'm yielded and humbly thine
A servant to thee

Anoint me Lord this day
As I go along my way
Let my life send forth a glow
Let the oil around me flow
Anoint me Lord
This day I pray
Amen

Broken hearts and lives
Can be mended anew
Just with one touch
Dear Lord from you
Let the oil and the wine
Bring healing divine
To every wounded soul
Let it overflow
