BELLE

Little town It's a quiet village
Ev'ry day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say:

TOWNSFOLK

Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!

BELLE

There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Ev'ry morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town

BAKER

Good Morning, Belle!

BELLE

Good morning, Monsieur.

BAKER

And where are you off to, today?

BELLE

The bookshop.
I just finished the most wonderful story
About a beanstalk and an ogre and a -

BAKER

That's nice. Marie!
The baguettes!
Hurry up!

TOWNSFOLK

Look there she goes that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?

WOMAN

Never part of any crowd

MAN

'Cause her head's up on some cloud

TOWNSFOLK

No denying she's a funny girl that Belle

MAN I

Bonjour!

WOMAN I

Good day!

MAN I

How is your fam'ly?

WOMAN 2

Bonjour!

MAN 2

Good day!

WOMAN 2

How is your wife?

WOMAN 3

I need six eggs!

WOMAN 4

That's too expensive!

BELLE

There must be more than this provincial life!

BOOKSELLER

Ah, Belle.

BELLE

Good morning, sir.
I've come to return the book I borrowed.

BOOKSELLER

Finished already?

BELLE

Oh, I couldn't put it down.
Have you got anything new?

BOOKSELLER

Not since yesterday.

BELLE

That's all right.
I'll borrow . . . . . this one!

BOOKSELLER

That one?
But you've read it twice!

BELLE

Well, it's my favorite!
Far off places, daring swordfights, magic spells, a prince in disguise -

BOOKSELLER

If you like it all that much, it's yours!

BELLE

But sir!

BOOKSELLER

I insist.

BELLE

Thank you.
Thank you very much!

TOWNSFOLK

Look there she goes that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle

BELLE

Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my fav'rite part because --- you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!

WOMAN

Now it's no wonder that her name means "Beauty"
Her looks have got no parallel

SHOPKEEPER

But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd

MAN

Very diff'rent from the rest of us

TOWNSFOLK

She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, diff'rent from the rest of us is Belle!

LEFOU

I got it Gaston!
Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!
You're the greatest hunter in the whole world!

GASTON

I know.

LEFOU

No beast alive stands a chance against you. ---
And no girl, for that matter.

GASTON

It's true, LeFou.
And I've got my sights set on that one.

LEFOU

The inventor's daughter?

GASTON

She's the one - the lucky girl I'm going to marry.

LEFOU

But she's -

GASTON

The most beautiful girl in town.

LEFOU

I know, but -

GASTON

That makes her the best.
And don't I deserve the best?

LEFOU

Of course you do!

GASTON

Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle

BIMBETTES

Look there he goes Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh he's so cute!
Be still my heart I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!

WOMAN 1

Bonjour!

GASTON

Pardon

BELLE

Good day

WOMAN 2

Mais oui!

WOMAN 3

You call this bacon?

WOMAN 4

What lovely grapes!

MAN 1

Some cheese

WOMAN 5

Ten yards!

MAN 1

one pound

GASTON

'scuse me!

CHEESE MERCHANT

I'll get the knife

GASTON

Please let me through!

WOMAN 6

This bread -

WOMAN 7

Those fish -

WOMAN 6

it's stale!

WOMAN 7

they smell!

MEN

Madame's mistaken.

WOMEN

Well, maybe so

TOWNSFOLK

Good morning!
Oh, good morning!

BELLE

There must be more than this provincial life!

GASTON

Just watch,
I'm going to make Belle my wife!

TOWNSFOLK

Look there she goes
The girl is strange but special
A most peculiar mad'moiselle!

WOMEN

It's a pity and a sin

MEN

She doesn't quite fit in

TOWNSFOLK

'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl
That Belle!
