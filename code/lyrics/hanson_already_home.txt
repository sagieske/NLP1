Song:

You’ve been trapped in the mold
‘Cause you’ve been running in place
And now you’re casting a shadow
That’s hanging on my face

I see you keeping your distance
But you’re not telling me why
Well, look into the horizon
Instead of here and now tonight

I don’t know what is broken
You act like you don’t belong here at all
If you’ve really lost something
Maybe you should start where you’ve been before

I think you’re already home
I think you’re already home
But you keep running ‘round in circles but you end up
Right back at the eye of the storm, oh oh oh oh

When you see your reflection
Do you recognize yourself
‘Cause every word that you say
I hear another another cry for help

Well if you can’t see it
Why don’t you open your eyes
I’m right here waiting
You don’t have to go far

Because you’re already home
I think you’re already home
You keep running ‘round in circles but you end up
Right back at the eye of the storm, oh oh oh oh

When you’re all fed up being down
When you’re all fed up
You’ll be the last man standing on the battleground
When you’re all fed up being down
You can come home to this town

I think you’re already home
I think you’re already home
You keep running ‘round in circles but you end up
Right back at the eye of the storm, oh oh oh oh
