Song:

Two dollars shy of a five dollar bill
Last mile I pushed my truck uphill
About hurt me
I left my truck by the pump right where I parked it
Walked through the doors of the Last Chance Market
Have mercy, I was thirsty
The guy behind the counter said what's it gonna be
I said I don't know man, you tell me

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

I could feel that video camera watch me
Checkin' out the sale on the Old Milwaukee
(Mmm) Three bucks to my name
That cooler had every brand known to man
Tall boys, bottles, and aluminum cans
(Aww) What a shame
And it's gettin' pretty bad when you finally discover
It all comes down to either one or the other

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

I can see where this is headed
And I'm tired of talkin'
Cold beer unleaded
Hell I'm walkin'

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack
Makes life complicated when it costs the same
Hell it ain't no fun, to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
It's a tough ol' choice to make if you know what I mean
It's either beer of gasoline

Beer or gasoline

It's a gallon of gas, or a cold six pack
One goes in my tank, one comes in a sack

Now it ain't no fun to do without one
But I'll do a lot of walkin' if my motor don't run
