Song:

Two people touching lips
Hands on eachother's hips
Nothing else in the world but one another
The forty second floor on a distant shore
I wonder how we've strayed so far from this
Remember when we were
Just flesh and bones you sir
May have forgotten how good your world can be.

So, put down your hollow tips
And kiss your lovers lips
And know that fate is what we make of it.
Please end this. Please end this, before this ends us, ends us, ends us.

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay insde for good
I wanna stay inside for good, for good, for good, for good [echoeing out]

I read the news today
And everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait.
Better part of me knows that waiting in the throws
Is on par with reading while my eyes closed
"what can i do?" you say,
"its just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips! "

Put down your hollow tips
And kiss your lovers lips
And know that fate is what we make of it

Please end this, before this ends us.
Please end this, before this ends us.
Please end this, before this ends us.
Please end this, before this ends us.
Please end this, before this ends us... Ends us... Ends us... Ends us... Ends us.
