Song:

One day i had to leave my country, calm beach and palm tree...
That day i couldn't even cry
And i forgot that outside there would be other men
But today, but today, but today, i don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
The day carmen miranda died
They put a photograph in the magazine
Her dead mouth with red lipstick smiled
And people cried, i was about ten
But today, but today, but today, i don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then...
One morning they came around to take to jail
I smiled at them and said - all right
But alone in that same day's nigth i cried and cried again
But today, but today, but today, i don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then...
One night i saw a mexican film
These twin brothers tryed to kill each other
She opened her arms and got two bullets
And died sweetly without a sigh
But tonight, but tonight, but tonight, i don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then
One day i went down to the underground but
I missed the last train
And now that i'm just looking around
I feel a little more blue than then
Looking around...
I don't know why
I feel a little more blue than then...
