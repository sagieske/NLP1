I'm s***,
I'm cute,
I'm popular to boot,
I'm bitchen, great hair
The boys all love to stare
I'm wanted, I'm hot
I'm everything your not
I'm pretty
I'm cool
I dominate the school
Who am I? Just guess!
Guys wanna touch my chest!
I'm rockin'
I smile
& many think I'm vile!
I'm flyin'
I jump
You can look but don't you hump!! (woo!!)
I major
I roar
I swear I'm not a w***e!!
We cheer and we lead
We act like we're on speed!!
Hate us 'cause we're beautiful well we don't like you either!
We're cheerleaders!!
We are cheerleaders!!
Roll call!
Call me Big Red!
I'm W w whitney!!
C c courtney!! Rrrrr!!!!!!
Dude it's darcy
I'm Big Carver (yeah!)
Just call me Kasey!
I'm still Big Red!
I sizzle
I scorch!
And now I pass the torch!
The ballots are in and one girl has to win!
She's perky!
She's fun!
And now she's number one
