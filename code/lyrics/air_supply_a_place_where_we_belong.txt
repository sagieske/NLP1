Song:

I'm just a wandering gypsy
I'll sing for you tonight
And when the seats are empty
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight
And i'll be in the place where i belong


For who will tell the story
Except someone like me
Of tragedy and glory
Of lovers as they walk so blindly
And try to find a place where they belong
We all must find a place where we belong


Everybody knows me
Everone shows me
And i'll be here when you have gone
For the road to carry on
We all must find a place where we belong


If destiny has spoken
If finally the dawn has broken
We all must find a place where we belong


I'm just a wandering gypsy
I've sung for you tonight
And now the seats are empty
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight
And i'll be in the place where i belong
