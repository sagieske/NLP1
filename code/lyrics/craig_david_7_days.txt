Song:

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her her name
A six digit number & a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
Rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

Chorus

Monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday
I met this girl on monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday

Verse 2

Nine was the time
Cos I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped (back she flipped it, ooh the
Way she
Kicked it)
And I oh oh I yeah
Hope that she'd care
Cos I'm a man who'll always be there

Ooh yeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ooh yeah
Cos a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl hmm you don't seem to be like that
Cos there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When you feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me call me

Chorus

Monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday
I met this girl on monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday

Bridge

(break it down, uh break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh yeah
I can't get her of my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind thing
With you-oh.......

Chorus

Monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday
I met this girl on monday
Took her for a drink on tuesday
We were making love by wednesday
And on thursday & friday & saturday we chilled on sunday
