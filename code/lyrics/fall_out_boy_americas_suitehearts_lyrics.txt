Song:

You could have knocked me out with a feather
I know you heard this all before, but we're just hell's dreamer's
Wh-wh-why won't the world revolve around me?
Build my dreams, trees grow all over the streets

But I don't know much about classic cars
But I got a lot of friends talkin' classic coke
Down set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media, please!

Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins!

You can bow and pretend
That you don't, don't, know you're a legend of
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
Let my love loose again

But I don't know much about classic cars
But I got a lot of friends talkin' classic coke
Down set, one, hut, hut, hike
Media, please!

Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins!

You could have knocked me out with a (feather)
I know you've heard this all before

Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's Suitehearts
But I must confess (I must confess!)
I'm in love with my own sins

Let's hear it for
Let's hear it
Let's for lets -
Suitehearts!
