Song:

How does it feel to treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken

I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel
Tell me now, how do I feel?

Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more

And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now, how should I feel

I thought I told you to leave me
Well, I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
When your heart grows cold
When your heart grows cold
