[Lenny Kravitz & Big Boi] (Andre 3000)
I wanna see you again, see you again (earth-tone 3, the remix, Lenny Kravitz)
Don't you know we could win (Again, you know what time it is, Outkast)
I wanna see you again (Dirty South)
Big Boi, Knaimtalkinbout?, yeah, do somethin

[Lenny Kravitz] (Andre3000)
I been searchin for you, I've heard a cry within my soul
I never had a journey quite like this before
Now that you are, walking right through my door (I wanna see you again)

[Chorus: Lenny Kravitz (Andre3000)]
All of my life, where have you been (don't you know we could win)
I wonder if ill ever see you again, (wanna see you again)
And if I take times, I know we could win (don't you know we could win)
I wonder if ill ever see you again, (I wanna see you again)

[Lenny Kravitz (Andre3000)]
The sacred gift of heaven, for better worse wherever
And I will let somebody break it down, watch how you cry
Neee-ver (I wanna see you again)

[Chorus:]

[Lenny Kravitz]
I've gone through time, I've always known, that you were there
Upon your thrown, a lonely queen, without a king
I've longed for you, my love for ever

[Big Boi]
Ladies say forever, as a tony he say maybe
Cuz when you show emotion, some young ladies think its gravy
Thinkin the Hillary Clinton, not to mention, and she got yo baby
Your connection to this woman, makes you tingly conversating
You think about that p***y 24/7
365 duce four, straight pimpin you in heaven
Pousedta play ya post close up, then you make the most of
A situation that's raft-racing, then theres always???
Yeaaaah

[Chorus:] x2

[Lenny Kravitz] x4
I wonder if i-i ever see you again, (I wanna see you again)
