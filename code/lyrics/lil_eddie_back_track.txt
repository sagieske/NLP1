[Intro:]
(Yeah -eh, -eh)
(Yeah -eh, -eh)
(Yeah -eh, -eh, -eh, -eh)

(Yeah heh, heh, -eh, -eh)
(Yeah -eh, -eh, yeah)

[Verse 1:]
Have you ever met someone so different from anyone you ever met before in your life?

I mean you hit it off from the jump
Now you're movin' in a rush
So you don't even stop to think twice

'Cause you've been down for so long
Try'na recover from all the wounds from your past

Was it all just a big mistake?
'Cause the truth is things just ain't the same

[B-Section:]
(You were gone up to the morning, now I don't get it)
(When I'm beggin' for affection, no you don't get it)

Something about you wasn't makin' any sense to me
Feels like I'm trapped in a scary movie

[Chorus:]
We got stuck on fast forward
Now the mirror's all cracked

I see who you really are so we need to back track

If we're try'na save this, we should start where we're at and back track

Fill in the blanks that we missed baby
Learn to agree to disagree

So if we're try'na save this, we should start where we're at and back track

[Verse 2:]
It's so hard to focus on anything knowin' we didn't make up last night

It's like nowadays we can't discuss nothin' without wanna fuss takin' offense this ain't right

I'm not pointin' any fingers I just want a reason, end all the flower man steps

We gotta face our problems baby before we decide to walk away

[B-Section:]
(You were gone up to the morning, now I don't get it)
(When I'm beggin' for affection, no you don't get it)

Something about you wasn't makin' any sense to me
Feels like I'm trapped in a scary movie

[Chorus:]
We got stuck on fast forward
Now the mirror's all cracked
(Now the mirror's all cracked oh)

I see who you really are so we need to back track
(So we need to back track)

If we're try'na save this, (if we're try'na save this, if... , if yeah), we should start where we're at and back track

Fill in the blanks, (fill in the blanks baby), that we missed baby
Learn to agree to disagree
(Agree to disagree)

So if we're try'na save this, we should start where we're at and back track

[Bridge:]
I'll admit it could be tough dealin' with someone like me
When I'm mad at you I don't mean what I say

I'm not try'na play this off and leave your feelings with me
I'm more than willin' to do whatever it takes

What I need your commitment say that you will meet me half way so we could get things to how it should be

So don't wanna image livin' without you, it'd be no use
Baby we need to back track

Yeah whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, oh, whoo, whoo, whoo whoa, oh whoo... Whoa whoo...

[Chorus:]
We got stuck on fast forward
Now the mirror's all cracked
(Oh babe)

I see who you really are so we need to back track
(Back track yeah oh)

If we're try'na save this, we should start where we're at and back track
(Start where we're at and back track)

Fill in the blanks, (oh we need to fill in the blanks), that we missed baby
Learn to agree to disagree

(Rearrange everything we did wrong... Baby whoa oh whoa, whoa...)

So if we're try'na save this, we should start where we're at and back track

[Outro:]
(Yeah -eh, {Oh}, -eh)
[Oh]
(Yeah -eh, {Oh} -eh)
[Oh, oh]
(Yeah -eh, -eh, -eh, {Oh whoa, whoo whoa... } -eh)

(Yeah heh, heh, {Oh baby} -eh, -eh)
(Yeah -eh, {Oh baby} -eh, yeah)
{Oh we need to back track yeah}

(Yeah -eh, -eh)
{Oh whoa}
(Yeah -eh, -eh)
{Oh whoa}
(Yeah -eh, -eh, -eh, -eh)
{Oh whoo, ooh}

(Yeah heh, heh, -eh, -eh)
{Guess we need to back track}
(Yeah -eh, -eh, yeah)
