Song:

LET'S DANCE

Hey baby won't you take a chance
Say that you'll let me have this dance
Oh let's dance, let's dance
We'll do the twist and stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dancing that you wanna do, let's dance, let's dance

Hey baby if you're all alone
Say that you'll let me walk you home
Let's dance, let's dance
We'll do the twist and stomp, the mashed potato too
Any old dancing that you wanna do, let's dance, let's dance



RED RIVER ROCK



NO PARTICULAR PLACE TO GO

Riding along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile
My curiosity's running wild
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

Riding along with my collar loose
Still trying to get her belt a-loose
All the way home I held a grudge
But the safety belt it wouldn't budge
Cruisin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go



THE WANDERER

Well I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are well you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cos to me their all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze them, they don't even know my name
They call me the Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round
They call me the Wanderer, yeah the Wanderer
I roam around and round and round and round and round



I HEAR YOU KNOCKING

You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knocking on my door
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking go back where you been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
Now you're tellin' all your lies
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking go back where you been



LUCILLE

Lucille you don't do your Daddy's will
Lucille you don't do your Daddy's will
Ain't nothing to you but I love you still

I woke up this morning, Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about her, all their lips were tight
Lucille you don't do your Daddy's will
Ain't nothing to you but I love you still



GREAT BALLS OF FIRE

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, oh what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

Kiss me baby, it feels good
Hold me baby, well I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
I gotta tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs
I feel embarrassed but it sure is fun
Come on baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire.
