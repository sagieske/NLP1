Song:

(Christian Bale) Think for one f*****g second, what the f**k are you doing? Are you professional or not? No! No! Don't shut me up.

Ex-juvenile delinquent
Yes, relapse when I fought with Jemosen
I'm thinkin 'bout death like it's p***y in my mind
And the vibe, and I'm feelin like life's so lame
Heaven's probably iller, with way more babes
Way more ways to get fededed?
My first album was in and out the front
Cats tryna play me, now I gotta show 'em what is what
I'm the one who comes when you're feelin so numb
You're the one who runs so I'm the one who hunts you
Most tryna remember it's so fun to confront you
I am the rager, I am forever
Half of the time most the time I'm blunted
If I die it wouldn't all be for nothin
And all my life I'm doin what I wanna
So I'm livin' in the moment til God push the button on me

Hmm, these n****s all talk hey
Hmm, these n****s all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin
Hmm, these n****s all talk hey
Hmm, these n****s all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin

I'm a cold young man west Cleveland represtenter
My b***h could take your b***h home with her
I'm hot and cold, but never lukewarm
And n****s always talkin bout what they can do for 'em
I'm the prince I came royal p**** stay clean
All the s**t that I seen you can only day dream
Runnin my city since I was 18

And cold so f**k what a hater might think
Chillin on the higher side of the clouds
Life was nothin like life is now
Just wanna have a couple dollars on deck
And change their perspec Ima aim for the neck
In the club I see you n****s jumpin up and down sweatin
Only for attention
Pathetic
You only paid twelve hundred dollars for that old school,
Name droppin a** n***a, don't nobody know you

Hmm, these n****s all talk hey
Hmm, these n****s all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin
Hmm, these n****s all talk hey
Hmm, these n****s all talk
Over here we ain't half steppin
Over here we ain't half steppin

I can show you how to do this lame n***a
Uneducated n***a I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame n***a
Uneducated n***a I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do this lame n***a
Uncultured motha fucka I can show you how to do it
I can show you how to do it lame n***a
Over here we ain't half steppin
