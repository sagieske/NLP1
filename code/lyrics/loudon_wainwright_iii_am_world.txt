Song:

I'm riding in a long black car
I'm riding in a long black car
Chauffeur's in the front, I'm in the back
It's a limousine and I'm a star
It's calculated and it's cold
It's calculated and it's cold
They love my ass, I go first class
Who needs a heart of gold
It's not all swell as it seems
No the dream's not as swell as it may seem
There's ups and there's downs and autograph hounds
It's not all peaches and cream
But yes it's a dream come true
Yes it's a dream come true
I got three guitars, I got credit cards
I got more money than you
Baby it's an A.M world
Baby it's an A.M world
Get yourself a flag, run it up a pole
And keep that thing unfurled
I'm riding in a long black car
I'm riding in a long black car
Chauffeur's in the front, I'm in the back
It's a limousine and I'm a star
