Song:

I don’t mind, letting you down easy but just give me time
If it don’t hurt now but just wait, just wait a while
You’re not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When the world don’t orbit around you?

Ain’t it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain’t it good?
Being all alone

Where you from?
You might be the one who’s running things
Well you could ring anybody's bell to get what you want
You see it’s easy to ignore trouble
When you’re living in your bubble

So what are you gonna do
When the world don’t orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you?

Ain’t it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain’t it good?
Being all alone

Ain’t it good to be on your own?
Ain’t it fun you can't count on no one?
Ain’t it good to be on your own?
Ain’t it fun you can't count on no one?
Ain’t it fun?
Living in the real world

Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world
Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world

Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world
Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world

Ain’t it fun? Ain’t it fun? Living, now you’re one of us
Ain’t it fun? Ain’t it fun? Ain’t it fun?

Ain’t it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain’t it good? Ain't it good?
Being all alone

Ain’t it fun?
Living in the real world (‘Cause the world don’t orbit around you)
Ain’t it good? Ain't it good?
Being all alone

Don’t go crying to your mama (To your mother)
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world (Don’t go crying)
Don’t go crying to your mama (To your mama)
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world
Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world (This is the real world, this is the real world)
Don’t go crying to your mama (Don't go crying)
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world
Don’t go crying to your mama
‘Cause you’re on your own in the real world
Don’t go crying (Don’t you go, don’t you go crying)
Don’t go crying (You’re on your own)
Don’t go crying (Don’t go crying to your mother)
Don’t go crying…
