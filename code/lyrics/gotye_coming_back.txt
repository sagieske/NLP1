Song:

You've been gone much longer
Than you ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'till you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait till you come home

Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day
You're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Lover
Leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'll wait patiently
For your return
You're coming back!
You're coming back!

I'm clutching at straws
I'm climbing up the walls
But every time I fall
Back into my hole
I'm feeling like a wretch
I'm looking for a catch
But you're an itch that I can't scratch
I know you're coming back

You've been gone so long you're fading
And it takes all the time I can find just retaining
Thoughts of things we did while you were here
But I know you will return my dear
