Song:

Old as Ancient Skies
I've had these wandering eyes
But you took me by surprise when you let me inside of you

Inside of you
Inside of you
There's got to be
Some part of me
Inside of you

Inside of you, I could cross this desert plane
Inside of you, I can hear you scream my name
Inside of you, while the stars unfold
I've crossed me heart and I've crossed the world
And I need you here and I need to be
Inside of you

Now the flowers bloom
I feel you creep into my room
And if this should be our tomb
I'll die here inside of you

And the world explodes
I've never been down this road
Teach me how to grow
While I'm moving
Inside of you

Inside of you, the restless find their dreams
Inside of you, this king has found his queen
Inside of you, while the stars unfold
I've crossed me heart and I've crossed the world
And I need you here and I need to be
Inside of you

(Instrumental)

Inside of you
Bay blue
So say it's you
To thoughts untrue
Who I woo
It's you I woo

Through and through
And through and through
There's so much more than just a s***w
Inside of you

And I was blizzard blind
Felt like I'd lost me mind
But you've treated me so kind
I don't know what to do.
