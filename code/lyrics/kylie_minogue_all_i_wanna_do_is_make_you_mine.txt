Song:

You have got to believe me
I would never deceive you
I would never let you go
Don't talk about leavin'
Leavin' me here

You were never at home
When I called you on the phone, and
I'm taken for a fool
Don't talk about romance
Talk about last dance

Don't talk about love
Like it is a fashion
Love without true passion
Are we really still in love
And all I wanna do
Is make you mine, mine, mine

Chorus: All I really wanna do
Is make you so, so happy
All I really wanna do
Is make you smile
We can't go talking
This over and over
And all I wanna do
Is make you mine

Don't let's take it for granted
You still wanna be wanted
All we ever do is fight
Talk about leavin'
Each other behind

Don't talk about love
Like it has not meaning
Love without true feeling
Are we really so alone
'Cause all I wanna do
Is make you mine, mine, mine

Chorus:

Chorus:

Don't talk about love
Like it is a fashion
Love without true passion
Are we really still in love
And all I wanna do
Is make you mine, mine, mine

Chorus:
Mine mine

Chorus: (repeat & fade)
