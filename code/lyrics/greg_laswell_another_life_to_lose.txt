Song:

And so it's back to it now
Enough turned out to be enough somehow
What the f- are you gonna do
That was me, it wasn't you

I packed light
And got right out
Left a lot behind no
More rhymes and less words
I will keep them tucked under

At least you have another way to go
At least you have another life to

And I have places for things again
From now on I'll hold more in
Turns out that I don't owe you sh-t
And it was never my intention

To cause you harm
Or to make you sore
And I don't know what the final score is
All I know is
These days I'm quite over it

At least you have another way to go
At least you have another life to

At least you have another life to lose
At least you have another life to lose

And so it's back to it now
Enough turned out to be enough somehow
What the f- are you gonna do
That was me, it wasn't you

I packed light
And got right out
Left a lot behind
No more rhymes
And use less words
And I will keep them all tucked under

And I have places for things again
From now on I'll hold more in
Turns out that I don't owe you sh-
And it was never my intention

To cause you harm
Or make you sore
And I don't know what the final score is
All I know is
These days I'm quite over it
