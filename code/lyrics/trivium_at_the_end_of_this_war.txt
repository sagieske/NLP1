Song:

There is no life at the end on this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end on this war eternally

You claim me as the living dead
You better aim for my head
You better aim for my head
Consume the flesh make my amends
Into the earth we descend
Into the earth we descend

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you laid
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end of this war eternally

A battle with no end in sight
How can you kill without life
You cannot kill without life
We have brought the fall of man
The blood it covers our hands
It is all over our hands

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you laid
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end of this war eternally

[Solo ckb]

[Solo mkh]

There is no life

There is no life at the end of this war,
Soon you will see,
Left with nothing at the end of this war.
Eternally.

There is no life at the end of this war,
Soon you will see,
Left with nothing at the end of this war.
(At the end of this war!)
Eternally.
