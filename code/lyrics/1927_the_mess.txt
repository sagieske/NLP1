Song:

There's a party goin' on
Seems like nothin's wrong
Everyone's havin' a hell of a rage
The place looks like a war's been waged
Got a little surprise
For dawn's shell-shocked eyes
Who's gonna be left to clean up the mess?

There's a bit of a scare
In a foreign affair
All it might take is a slip of the facts
Someone somewhere over-reacts
Won't they be wishin'
When we've all gone fission
Who's gonna be left to clean up the mess?

All I wanna know just before I go
All I wanna know is
Who's gonna clean up the mess?

All I wanna know just before I go
All I wanna know is
Who's gonna clean up the mess?

All the power mad gluttons
With itchy fingers on the buttons
Startin' the end of the craziest race
There's no-one left to take first place
Well I've got a query
About your Big Bang Theory tell me
Who's gonna be left to clean up the mess ?
Who's gonna be left to clean up the mess?
Who's gonna be left to clean up the mess?
