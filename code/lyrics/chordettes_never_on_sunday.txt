Song:

Oh, you can kiss me
On a Monday, a Monday
A Monday is very, very good

Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday
In fact, I wish you would

Or you can kiss me
On a Wednesday, a Thursday
A Friday and Saturday is best

But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday
Cause that's my day of rest

Most any day, you can be my guest
Any day you say but my day of rest
Just name the day
That you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest

Oh, you can kiss me on a
Cool day, a hot day, a wet day
Whichever one you choose

Or try to kiss me on a gray day
A May day, a pay day
And see if I refuse

And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a weekday
Well, you can be my guest

But never ever on a Sunday
A Sunday, the one day
I need a little rest

Oh, you can kiss me on
A weekday, a weekday, a weekday
The days to be my guest

But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday
Cause that's my day of rest

But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday
Cause that's my day of rest
