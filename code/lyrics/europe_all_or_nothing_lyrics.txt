Song:

I'd bet my soul on a roll of a dice
I hit th ground runnin' and I never think twice
I'd brave the heat of a Wild cat fire
To satisfy my animal desire
Can't stop me now I've set my sights on you
Right to you heart My aim is true
, yeah, that's why
All or nothing at all
Is how I feel about it
Won't stand my back to the wall
I'll find my way around it
All or nothing at all
There's nothing I won't do
And the one thing I want All of is you
Don't want to labor at love
Rather do without
Won't carry the torch I want to burn down the house
I wanna give you all my lovin“ë Baby listen to this
I would never settle for Anything less
Can't stop me now Once you've got me goin'
Can 't slow me down I'm driven by your motion
All or nothing at all
Is how I feel about it
Won't stand my back to the wall
I'll find my way around it
All or nothing at all
There's nothing I won't do
And the one thing I want All of is you
