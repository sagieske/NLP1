Song:

Sitting on the stairs by your house
And I'm waiting for you to come out
But I won't be held responsible
No, I can't be held responsible

For every lie that you have ever told
Because you've told so many
And I've been waiting for the truth to fall
From your lips and your breath again

[Chorus:]
See me when you sleep
'Cause you've been dreaming
Faded memories
That we once shared
And I'll be waiting for
You to fall on your knees

Your knees again

Sitting on the stairs by your house
And I'm waiting for you to come out
But I won't be held responsible
No, I can't be held responsible

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

Your knees again

[Chorus 2x]

Your knees again
