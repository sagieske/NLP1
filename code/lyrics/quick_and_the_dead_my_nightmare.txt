Song:

[Verse:]
My nightmare's never ending
Of sin-filled frustration gone
But not alone
Darkness falls around me
But I still hear them sing
The angels call to me
[Chorus:]
Caught in a nightmare
And I can't get out on my own
And I can't get out on my own
[Verse 2:]
I'm feeling so cold and I know that
It's killing me inside
I don't have much more time
To try to find out what's with my life
[Chorus:]
Why?
Why did we stop trying?
Why did we stop trying?
[2x]
Things could be perfect now
Why did we stop trying
Why did we
This could be perfect
This could be perfect for us
