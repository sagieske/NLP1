[You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]

Why everything that's s'posed to bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to, is exactly what I would.
Man I tried to stop, man I tried the best I could, but

[You make me smile]

What's your addiction, is it money, is it girls, is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three.
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us.
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drug. [You make me smile]
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so, curious.
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush.
Time's of the essence, I need you, to be spon-taneous.

Roll up the doja, henny and c-c-c-cola. [You make me smile]
And I'm co-co-ming over, 'cause it's ne-never over. [ooh]

Why everything that's s'posed to bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to, is exactly what I would.
Man I tried to stop, man I tried the best I could, but

[You make me smile]

I see the emotion, in your eyes, that you try, not to show.
We get the closest, when you high, or you drunk, or you blow.
So I pour the potion, so we could both, get high, as we could go.
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs, is exposed. [You make me smile]
There's no turning back now, I mean, I don't mean, to impose.
Not now, but right now, I need you, to undress, and then pose.
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed.

Roll up the doja, henny and c-c-c-cola. [You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]
And I'm keep' co-co-ming over, 'cause it's ne-never over.

Why everything that's supposed to bad, make me feel so good? {na-na-na-na-na}
Everything they told me not to, is exactly what I would. {na-na-na-na-na}
Man I tried to stop, man I tried the best I could, but {na-na-na-na-na}

[You make me smile]

{na-na-na-na-na}
{na-na-na-na-na}
{na-na-na-na-na}

[You make me smile]

{pa-da-pa-pa-da}
{pa-da-pa-pa-da}
{pa-da-pa-pa}

[You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]

(Why everything that's s'posed to bad, make me feel so good?) {pa-da-pa-pa-da}
(Everything they told me not to, is exactly what I would.) {pa-da-pa-pa-da}
(Man I tried to stop, man I tried the best I could, but) {pa-da-pa-pa}

[You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]

I just wanted to ask you, just wanna to uhm.
Let me, how would I put this uhm?
Let's say, all your friends, remember the one-one?
You said, if you ever, she would be the one.
Okay, okay, okay [You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]
Well, I was thinking, hypothetically, I mean, don't take this seriously.
Don't take me, I mean just, uh not credibly, I'm feeling incredibly.
I mean, let's say that we, uh just let it be, I mean, you, her and me.
I mean, you, her and me, maybe, baby. [You make me smile, with my heart, ooh]
Baby, baby, baby
You know, I was just kidding, unless you gonne do it.
