Song:

1, 2 All I got is a semi-automatic smile
Oh s**t I gotta get high
Act now if you know who you are
You'll be lookin' at the picture
Just to see you're a star
The invisible, the great, the incredible
You talk too much
You talk about unspeakable
Stop the lies, never act surprised, what
You run away never pay the price

So you pull me down to get you high
Coz the sun won't shine for you to fly
~ Coz I don't know now so don't you try ~
So hide yourself and you deny

Brother, brother come on, got to get it on
I'm steppin' on the zone, I don't want to be alone
And I exercise my right to not give up the fight
Tonight is the night I wanna bring you to the light

Pre-chorus
So speakin' kinda easy
Losin' your mind, you're goin' crazy
I'm bringin' it back, holdin' it back
All you need is to react
Do you really wanna feel me
Everytime you try to hurt me
I'm walkin' away, flyin' away
Find myself another day
So tell me what you feel
Tell me what is real
~ Tell me what's the deal ~
With the pain you try to heal
So do you really care
Is this really fair
Better beware
Throw your hands in the air

Chorus
One! Maybe you can shine like the sun
Two! Take everything that is for you
Three! Open your eyes if you wanna see
Four! Check the mic and check the score
Five! Use your heart and try to survive
Six! Do you wanna die with crucifix
Seven! Your sins will be unforgiven
Even if you know how to stop from breathin'

3, 4 I better get some more
Yo mi casa es su casa never shut the door
And all the people in the place
Who really want to rock with me
We will never ever stop until the next century
I'm free, and don't you wanna stay with me
I'll be the worst thing that you'll ever see
So let it be, and let me see the real me
I will try to take you if you wanna bounce with me

You crucify and then you lie
Coz you don't see the crime, you testify
I talk to you, you don't reply
Stop dreaming now, open your eyes

I never wanna take it
All I wanna do is break it
I'm so sick of you, all I wanna do is fake it
So forget it, I never wanna think about it
I spit, I quit, I never wanna hear it

Pre-chorus
So speakin' kinda easy
Losin' your mind, you're goin' crazy
I'm bringin' it back, holdin' it back
All you need is to react
Do you really wanna feel me
Everytime you try to hurt me
I'm walkin' away, flyin' away
Find myself another day
So tell me what you feel
Tell me what is real
~ Tell me what's the deal ~
With the pain you try to heal
So do you really care
Is this really fair
Better beware
Throw your hands in the air

Chorus
One! Maybe you can shine like the sun
Two! Take everything that is for you
Three! Open your eyes if you wanna see
Four! Check the mic and check the score
Five! Use your heart and try to survive
Six! Do you wanna die with crucifix
Seven! Your sins will be unforgiven
Even if you know how to stop from breathin'
