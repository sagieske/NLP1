Song:

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces, life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful
I may be wrong but I think you're swell
I like your style say, I think it's marvelous
I'm always wrong so how can I tell

Deuces to me are all aces, life is to me just a bore
Faces are all open spaces
You might be John Barrymore
You came along say I think you're wonderful
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

You said that Edison would never make that light
You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and kite
The point of the song is I'm always wrong
But with you, baby I'm oh so right
