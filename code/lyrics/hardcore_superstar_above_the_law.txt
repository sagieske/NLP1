Song:

My dad was a good man, he wanted it all,
But no one never told him you can’t break the law.
All he wanted, to please me and my mom
Did not mean to hurt or harm no one.

And it goes on and on, it ain’t no fun,
The road becomes my only home.
But the chase will always be far too fun,
Like my dad, I’m on the run.

I don’t care at all, above the law
Like my dad, I’m a thief, I take what I want.
Forget it all, f**k the law
I don’t care who you are, I get what I want
I take what I want.

My hero he is, forget about mom.
The only thing I need right now, the warmth of a gun.
Only wanted to please me and my mom
I guess he did not mean to hurt no one.

And it goes on and on, it ain’t no fun,
The road becomes my only home.
But the chase will always be far too fun,
Like my dad, I’m on the run.

I don’t care at all, above the law
Like my dad, I’m a thief, I take what I want.
Forget it all, f**k the law,
I don’t care who you are, I get what I want
I take what I want.

Yeah!
And it goes on and on, it ain’t no fun,
The road becomes my only home.
But the chase will always be far too fun,
Like my dad, I’m on the run.

I don’t care at all, above the law
Like my dad, I’m a thief, I take what I want.
Forget it all, f**k the law
I don’t care who you are, I get what I want
I don't care at all, f**k the law
Like my dad, I’m a thief, I take what I want.
I don't care at all, f**k the law
I don’t care who you are, I get what I want
I take what I want
I get what I want
I take what I want
