Song:

I'm talking 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore

I feel your heart beating (boom, boom, boom)
Put in my car keys and (vroom, vroom, vroom)
I smell your fragrance like flowers in full bloom
I savour your flavour like (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Look at you through my window (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You act like we're just friends though (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Excuse these innuendos and I can't get you outta my mind, and I can't get you out

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'

Now I'm at your door (knock, knock, knock)
Lay on the floor, you're on (top, top, top)
We can be the party come on let's (rock, rock, rock)
I'm dreaming I feel it like (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Look at you through my window (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So stoked that you're my neighbour (ooh, ooh, ooh)
So close I can almost taste ya and I can't get you outta my mind and I can't get you out

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'

All day you got me going crazy
Can't shake that feeling that she gave me
All day got me going crazy (G-got me going crazy)

There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
And every time I look at her
I imagine walking through her door

Girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'
There's something 'bout the girl next door
Something that I can't ignore
She got me like 'Oooh'
She got me like 'Oooh'

There's something 'bout the girl next door
I'm talking 'bout the girl next door
