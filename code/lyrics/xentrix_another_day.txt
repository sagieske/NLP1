Song:

Another day, you've no concerns but the desire burns
Another day, for you to face your problem
Is that the way that you wanna be ?
A constant liability
Another day, why can't you see what you are gonna be
Another day, will pass away unoticed
Your remedy for peace and quiet
Constant intake liquid fire
Good intentions promanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?
Everything revolves around the habit
Like it or not it is the bottom line
Hand to mouth a single reflex you are mine
Detached from being forget your problems
No misgivings are you happy now ?
Good intentions promanent again
Another crisis imminent again
Your worst side dominant again
Look at yourself again
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
Look at yourself, what do you see ?
What do you see ?
