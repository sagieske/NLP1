Song:

Standing at the mirror rinsing off my razor
Wish I was still in bed
You're sneaking up behind me
With nothing but a towel on
You start breathing down my neck

If you don't wanna spend the rest of this day
Lying the dark, driving each other crazy
Careful where you kiss me

I love your sweet good morning baby hugs
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
Careful where you kiss me

You know the buttons you know where to push em
And which ones turn me on
You're putting me on the spot
No, baby, don't stop
Cause girl, I'm not that strong

I don't know how far you want this to go
But, baby, I just might lose control
Careful where you kiss me

I love your sweet good morning baby hugs
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
Careful where you kiss me

I love your sweet good morning baby hugs
But you know how your soft lips tear me up
Careful where you kiss me

Oh, careful where you kiss me
Yeah, careful where you kiss me
Oh, careful where you kiss me
Oh, careful where you kiss me
Ah, yeah
