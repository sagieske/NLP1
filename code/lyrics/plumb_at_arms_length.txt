Song:

Maybe we can heal each other
Maybe this won't hurt forever
I don't wanna push you away
I don't wanna hold you at arm's length
I don't wanna push you away
It's just a knee jerk reaction

I put my heart
Up for sale
And you gave yours
Away for free
And now we're mad
At the world
So now we
Bruise and hit
With words that hurt
But love is faster than a bullet
It's the perfect remedy

So maybe we can heal each other
Maybe this won't hurt forever
I don't wanna push you away
I don't wanna hold you at arm's length
I don't wanna push you away
It's just a knee jerk reaction

I kick and scream
You scream and shout
If we don't get our way
Right now
We act like children
On a Ferris wheel
We go
Round and round
Until we stop
And nothing's left
For us to drop
I'm sick of feeling
All this misery

Maybe we can heal each other
Maybe this won't hurt forever
I don't wanna push you away
I don't wanna hold you at arm's length
I don't wanna push you away
It's just a knee jerk reaction

Don't run away, don't run away
Come back to me
Don't run away, don't run away
Come back
Don't run away, don't run away
Come back to me
My love is here, my love is here
At arm's length

Maybe we can heal each other
Maybe this won't hurt forever
