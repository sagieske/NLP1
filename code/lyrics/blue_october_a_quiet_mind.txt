Song:

A slow strangle with your feet on the floor
I've got 14 angels and we're sleeping alone
In the back of a cave, where the rest of us go
To feel normal

I call baby up. Leave me alone.
I'm in pain but I won't let you band-aid my wound
I am mad at a stage where I can't seem to handle my own (Can't even handle my)

And give me a quiet mind and I...
I love you
You give me a quiet mind and I...
I love you
Until the end (Until the end)

Give me strength to be kind... To combine
All the good things in life that are so hard to find
But I have and I won't let them go like I do with my friends (My friends)

Still hearing voices... From front... From behind
They're the reason I choose... When to live... How to die
When to cast... When to reel
When to buy... When to steal
And when to fiend for the friends that taught you
Being inappropriate will

Give me a quiet mind and I...
I love you
You give me a quiet mind and I...
I love you

(Repeat Chorus)

Until the end
Until the end
