Song:

[Chorus:]
Need a woman by Friday
Need a woman by Friday night
Need a woman by Friday
Need a woman by Friday night

I get addicted to beginnings
Fall in love with the first part
If I know anything at all
I know how to start

It's always just a conversation
It doesn't have to go too far
But far enough to let me know
You could be what I want

So don't talk, shut up
Let me lay it down
Because that's what you want

[Chorus:]
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night

So can we come to an agreement
And decide upon the terms
Let me spell it out, and tell you how this could work
You will pretend that I can save you
And I'll pretend you're the one
Because that's all we want

[Chorus:]
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night

A woman by my side would change me
And even when my pride betrays me
If I could ever find a lady
Then I will be fine, then I will be fine

Need a Woman, need a woman, need a woman (x4)

[Chorus:]
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night
Need a Woman by Friday
Need a Woman by Friday night
