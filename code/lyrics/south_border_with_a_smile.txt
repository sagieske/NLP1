Song:

Lift your head
Baby don't be scared
Of the things that could
Go wrong along your way
You'll get by with a smile
You can't win at everythin
But you can try
Baby you don't have to worry
Coz there ain't no need to hurry
No one every said there'll be
An easy way
When they're closin
All their doors
And they don't want you anymore
It sounds funny but i'll say
It anyway
Girl i'll stay
Through the bad times
Even if I have
To fetch you everyday
You'll get by if you smile
You can never be
Too happy in this life

Refrain:
In a world where everybody hates
A happy endin story
It's a wonder love
Can make the world go round
But don't let them
Bring you down
And turn your face into a frown
You'll get along
With a little prayer
And a song

Let me hear you sing it
Repeat refrain
Lift your head
Baby don't be scared
Of the things that
Could go wrong
Along your way
You'll get by with a smile
Now it's time to kiss away
Those tears goodbye
Let me hear you sing it
If you smile
