Song:

They pulled the switch that sent me far
Into the rich and distant stars
Bounced me back into your car
Returning with a smile
Constantly in rotation
An astronaut on the radio station
Passing on that sweet sensation
If only for a while
A smile finally saved me, found me and repaid me
For all the time that I've put in
And now I'm smiling back again
Just smile for a while
We've just begun to smile
A canyon cracks a smile at me
As I pass at 80, 000 feet
Revolving only to receive America, America
Please be free, be a part of me
We need unilateral harmony
Something that will help us be
Better than before
A smile finally saved me, found me and repaid me
For all the time that I've put in
And now I'm smiling back again
Just smile for a while
We've just begun to smile
As I wonder through
It's all right in front of you
Every moment matters in the end
Smile at what used to be
The glory and the agony
Smile at a memory
Smile at your enemies, yeah
A smile finally saved me, found me and repaid me
For all the time that I've put in
And now I'm smiling back again
Just smile for a while
We've just begun to smile
Smile for a while
Smile
