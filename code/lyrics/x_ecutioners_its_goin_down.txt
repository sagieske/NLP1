Song:

[Intro:]
I knew I was being threatened
Do you think it's worth holding out
I mean I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys
Ugly stories

(electric guitar starts)
Watch them flee.. Watch them flee *scratches*
Rap up *scratches*
Watch them flee *scratches*
Hip-hop hits *scratches*
And you do it like this

(mike shinoba)
[Verse:]
Its going down
The rhythm projects round the next sound
Reflects the complex hybrid dialect now
Detect the mesh of many elements compressed down
The melting pot of a super-futureesque style
The combination of a vocal caress
With lungs that gasp for breath
From emotional stress
With special effects
And a distorted collage
Carefully lodged between beats of rhythmic barrage

[pre-chorus](2x)
Its going down
The logical progression on a the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's going down

[chorus](2x)
Put put.. Put it up *scratches*
I said it goes like this *scratches*
And you do it like this *scratches*
Its going down

(mike shinoba)
[Verse 2:]
Once again it is
Composed sentences all together venomous
The four elements of natural force
Projected daily through the sound of the source
Everybody on board with this blend
The sword with the pen
The mightiest is the weapons
Swinging right from the chin
The elevate of mental states
Long gone with the wind
To defend men for shoddy imitation pretends
Its going down
Stalence emulation readily
Trekking through the weaponry
Of the pure pedigree
Cleverly seeing through whatever is ahead of me
Whatever the weather be
We invent the steadily
Its going down to sub-terrestrial high
I rhyme regiment that's calling the shots
Execution of collaborative plots
Ready to bring the separation of style to a stop

[Pre-Chorus:]
Its going down
The logical progression on a the timeline
The separation narrowed down to a fine line
To blur the edges so they blend together properly
Take you on an audible odyssey
Now it's going down

[chorus](2x)
Put put.. Put it up *scratches*
I said it goes like this *scratches*
And you do it like this *scratches*
Its going down

(x-ecutioners)
X-men bout to blast of world wide *scratches*
Yo it's request only *scratches*
X-men bout to blast of world wide *scratches*
Its built from scratch
Album in stores soon
Bout to blast off world wide *scratches*
And you do it like this

Its going down

[chorus](2x)
Put put.. Put it up *scratches*
I said it goes like this *scratches*
And you do it like this *scratches*
Its going down
