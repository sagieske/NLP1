Song:

Twisted minds that work as one,
They plot your destiny.
You stand and watch your only son,
Deprived of dignity.
Contempt and hatred all you feel,
Devoted loyalty.
A wound you know will never heal.
Doubting integrity.

You sent him out to pay the price.
Did what you thought was best.
You sent him out to be a man.
Almost laid to rest.
Unseen powers that deal the cards,
Faceless homocide.
A bitter rage you can't reveal,
Because of stupid pride.

What you want ain't always good for you.
It; s just the way the balance swings for you,
Balance swings for you.

Have no conscience, feel no pain,
All you need's a flag.
No glory now, the switch is made,
Uniform to body bag.
But after all, did you see the truth?
Find the real war?
What you want ain't always good for you.
No cause worth dying for.
What you want...
