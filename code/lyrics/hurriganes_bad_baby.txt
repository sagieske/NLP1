Song:

I got to see somebody at home
And not hugginґ all night long
Iґm gonna take you home at eight
Iґm gonna work till youґre out of gate
Gonna take you workinґ out of the road
Gonna make you find the ladyґs proude
My little babay was sick fat and stoned
She was a gruby waitinґ on the phone
She got some buginґ and suckinґ at night
Iґm the guy whoґs workinґ on her sight
Gonna take you workinґ out of road
Gonna make you find the ladyґs proud
Just on that little dancing street
Here I am and get you up on your feet
Shake it baby and shake it fast
That rollinґ bollinґ is out of my past
No more hugginґ and bugginґ around
Iґm the one who takes you out of the town
Gonna take you workinґout of road
Gonna make you find the ladyґs proud
Just on that little dancing street
Here I am and get you up on your feet
