Song:

Maybe it was no one's fault. I know it wasn't mine. But now that you've
Moved along. I guess I'm next in line. I thought we had the same ideas. But
You, you proved me wrong. I've been played the fool before. But never for
Quite so long.
[Chorus:]
Betray.
So what now? Do we shake hands, and go on our separate ways? Or do I open my
Mind, and follow you into the haze? No, I'll see you tomrrow. Same channel,
Same time, same place. I'm not going anywhere. 'Cause I quit your f*****g
Race.
[Chorus:]
Goddamit, we were supposed to stay young. And now it's over, it's finished,
It's done. Normal expectations, they were on the run. But now it's over,
It's finished, it's done.
