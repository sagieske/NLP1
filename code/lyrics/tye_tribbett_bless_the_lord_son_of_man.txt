Song:

Oh We Thank You Lord
Oh! 

[Verse 1:]
Son Of Man
Son of Righteousness
King of the earth
For sinners slain
I was lost
In darkness bound
Randsomed my heart
And I will sing
Yea! 
Come on
We worship you King
Oh mighty God
Oh! 
Come on and say "Son of man"

G.A.:
Son Of Man [Son of man]
Son of Righteousness
King of the earth
For Sinners slain
I was lost
In darkness bound
Randsomed my heart
And I will Sing

My Strength [Tye: You Are]
My Deliverer [Tye: You Are]
The one who rescued me [Tye: You Are]
My Hope [Tye: Hey and You Are]
