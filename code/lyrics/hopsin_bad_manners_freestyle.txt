[Verse:]
I've come to conclusion that life sucks
The only good that comes out of it is
Sticking my d**k into nice butts
So if it's wetter than normal inside your wife's c***
It's my nut i'll bust it inside of that a** and hasn't dried up (Ya)
I'm such a contradiction, I hang with Dizzy Wright
And all he does is smoke so when I'm breathing all the ganja gets in
Not to mention I'm condescending, my mind is missing
Plus I'm kinda sending the wrong signal
Oh god, I'm sickening
I'm not the one you wanna start s**t with
I'm part animal, part dimwit
With bad manners like Bart Simpson
You Hollywood n****s who write songs
I give you a black eye
That's a good reason to put some ice on
I'm like a Jedi with the Obi-Wan bars
Lyrics are shocking just like a phony gun charge
My n****s we only f**k with the dopey blonde broads
We play em, and trade em like they were Pokemon cards
I accell in rap
It's cuz I been through f*****g hell and back
You ain't close to dope
It's just that everybody else is whack
N****s getting jealous tryna diss me, Scary!
I'm an animal, f**k a Mink coat
B***h wear me!
Yo all you rappers quit your bitching
Just sit and listen I'm the new sick edition
Of Pac this is the demolition
I'm so tired of all the reminiscing
So I'mma leave these n****s shook
Like my d**k when I finish pissing
(Yo you f*****g nasty dog.)

Get off me!
I love Christ but guarantee
You wouldn't wanna cross me
I'm as frustrating as lost keys
My sick mind's a good example
Of what the crooked law breeds
I'm trying to die as the greatest rapper
S**t I'm so hungry I could stick my fist
In a blender and drink it after
You climbing up then I'm gonna break the ladder
And you'll fall off so damn hard
That every bone in your face will shatter
F**k these n****s, I'm a racist b*****d
You hear the devil speaking in tongues
On this cd if you play it backwards
Tell your sister I can't wait to smash her
But I heard that her p***y stinks
So make sure that she f*****g takes a bath first
I come second to none
My verbal weapon is perpetuous, and it's just as effective as guns
Gestures effectives as guns
You destined to plunge
Show me, I find it pleasant and fun
Like having s** with a nun
(What the heck have ya done!?)

Whoa. I'm known to hate
I use foul language to motivate
I know I'm dope, okay
But Hop ain't real
Was just a role I played
Earth, I don't know this place
But I just wanna stroll away
Into my homeless base
Wearing a pair of flying rollerblades

Ehhhhhh, f**k
