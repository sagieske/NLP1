Song:

Chorus:
Just set your sight high, look
'em right in the eye and take it
And make a big big big noise.
Don't ask why
Just take it wise and making it
Make that a big big big big noise.

You can feel it in the air
Feel it everywhere
There's a spirit moving
At just look, it's all around you
Just take a look around you people stars??? To loose it
Cos if you wanted you gotta go get it
Just to listen up
If there's something that you need
You better believe

Repeat chorus...

Better make your play
Don't let her thing like right or wrong, get it
Cos there's nothing to it if you just if you reach out and do it, it'll be ok
Just catch yourself a piece of the action
Just to listen up
If there's something that you need
You better believe

Repeat Chorus...

Cos if you wanted you gotta go get it
Just to listen up
If there's something that you need
You better believe
Repeat chorus to fade...
