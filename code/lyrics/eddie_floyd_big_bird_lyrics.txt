Song:

Open up the sky
Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you

You know I'm standing at the station, ready to go
Oh, big 'ol aeroplane, I'm trusting you so

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird,
Cause I got to make it,
Just get on up
Cause I got to make it,
Get on up

With me down here
And you up there
Now all we know is
It ain't no fair

'Cause I got love packed in my baggage
Holdin' my claim check,
Gonna be with my baby
And never comin' back

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird,
Up
Up
Just get on up

Open up the sky
Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you

Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up big bird,
Cause I got to make it,
Just get on up
Cause I got to make it,
Get on up
Get on up big bird,
Get on up big bird,
Get on up big bird,
Get on up big bird,
