Song:

Rocket ship to a place real far away
From the field where I have lost my way
A million people with a million souls
On the rocket ship that lost control
All I found was you
All I found was you
Rocket ship to a place real far away
From the field where I have lost my way
A million people with a million souls
On the rocket ship that lost control
All I found was you
All I found was you
