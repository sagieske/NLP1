Song:

If you think I love you, well, baby, you're right
If you think I wanna hold you, well, baby, you're right
I wanna love you, I wanna hold you

'Cause I [Incomprehensible]
Try me, darling, you know I need you

I wanna love you, I wanna hold you
'Cause I need you so bad but I can't get you
Yet you make me so mad

If you think I want you, well, baby, you're right
If you think I wanna hold you, well, baby, you're right
You know I love you, I wanna hold you

'Cause I [Incomprehensible]
Just me and you
Everything gonna be alright

I wanna love you, I wanna hold you
'Cause I need you so bad but I can't get you
Yet you make me so mad

I want you to try me
Your love with mine
One more time

I wanna love you, I wanna hold you
'Cause I need you so bad but I can't get you
Yet you make me so mad, please
