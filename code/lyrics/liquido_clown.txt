Song:

L don't know
What seers have said
But fate was q****
And times we had
Our big mistake was incomplete
So pure and sweet
We had to break
Our ties in two
L could not say l want you
L do recall what she has said now
What she has said to me now: l said l said l now
It's clicklesley calling
It's clicklesley calling
The sweetest sound in town
The sweetest sound I don't know
What time will come
L might be late
Though l will run
It is far and still a maze
The wish we chase
Our little world
Too small to breathe
Was like a stone
With us beneath
But don't regret. The time we had
The time we have - we have now: l said l said l now
It's clicklesley calling
It's-Clicklesley calling-. It's The sweetest sound in town
The-Sweetcst sound - it's not for the cause
It's not for the fiction
It's not for the cause
It's not for the fiction
L can't say what's to say now - no l can't say now
