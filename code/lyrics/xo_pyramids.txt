Song:

The only thing I never fell
Is a drug test
I tell her to bring it up cause she's upset
The realest ni***z are trying to f**k
And I'm scarrying like a pup
Beggin' me to stay for the sunset cause she know when a nigga's up next
I wanna see the top
But she's lookin' for a ride
Takin' main streets signs
I ain't got enought time
I can put you on a side, yeah
Riding back for the project
And the s**t is too real
Ain't know where to hide here
And I'm shouting every day

I've been rocking with the effect
Now they wonder why I'm in this s**t
Smokin'a lot, a lot
Coming late
It's late now
I really can't see on my land s**t

Ni***z fell off trying to hold on to the ledge
I swear the s**t is amazing
I'm just struck into the haze
Like a motherfucking. N***a
Damn

Gls on my intro
I'mma let these ni***z hatin'
It's all good

I'm just full of guns
Yeah, she's cooking narrow
I'm just chubby Barry like a f*****g barrel
Wanna get some barrels with the arrows

The thing is
I'm on my own
But just hear this s**t

Pyramids
I'm on my own
But just hear this s**t
On my own
But just hear this s**t
On my own
But just hear this s**t

Couple bars like a ghost ride
I find a bad b***h when she smokes right
I flow so high with the coke
I hang with that b***h
If the rope's tight
I'm just trying to finish all the quest
I'mma try hit it like a net
No rainy days give me neck
We're done playin' games
Who be next?
Who be next?

Main chick bad in one piece
Your chick ain't like a 5 piece
And the last thing you know is your wife's scream
My team is playing
And I'mma do that once I bust it
She gonna need clean necks and some ice-cream

Kid are you done?
We're running
It's a race, I know that
We running
But really I'm taking you
I wonder
Will you stay for the summer?
Still read on sleep bag like no wonder
We're just counting numbers
Tell me don't do it
I wanna
Telle me don't do it
I'm gonna

I'm just chubby Barry like a f*****g barrel
Wanna get some barrels with the arrows
I'm just full of guns
Yeah, she's cooking narrow

I'm just chubby Barry like a f*****g barrel
Wanna get some barrels with the arrows

Pyramids
I'm on my own
But just hear this s**t

Pyramids
I'm on my own
But just hear this s**t

Pyramids
I'm on my own
But just hear this s**t
On my own
But just hear this s**t
On my own
But just hear this s**t
