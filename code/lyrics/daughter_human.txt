Song:

Woken up like an animal
Teeth ready for sinking
My mind’s lost in bleak vision
I tried to escape but keep sinking

Limbs lost to a dead wait steak
Skull cage likea a prison
And he has lost faith to ever see again
So may he once taught of me then

Underneath the skin there’s a human
Buried deep within there’s a human
And despite everything I’m still human
But I think I’m dying here

Waking up like an animal
I’m all ready for healing
My mind’s lost with nightmares streaming
Waking up kicking screaming

Take me out of this place I’m in
Break me out of this shale case I’m in

Underneath the skin there’s a human
Buried deep within there’s a human
And despite everything I’m still human

I think that I’m still human
I think that I’m still human
I think that I’m still human

Underneath the skin there’s a human
Buried deep within there’s a human
And despite everything I’m still human
But I think I’m dying here
