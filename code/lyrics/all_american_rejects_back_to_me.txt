Song:

Hey you
So you never really found your way
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today?

I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me

No, don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around
(I swear I'll come around)

When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But I'm the only one you need

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way
If it's me
That you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find your way

Soon when I get you
I won't let you go
Oo if I let you
You can take away all that I thought was wrong
And if you hear me
There's not much to say
There's gotta be a better way

Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
I know you're going to find your way back to me
Can't you see?
I beg and plead
'Cause when the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find your way
If it's me
That you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight I know
You're never gonna find your way
You'll pace around the world 'til you're with me
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
