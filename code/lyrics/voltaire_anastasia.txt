Song:

There's a field of flowers and they smell like you
And i go walking through them when i feel you near me


You know I'd love to pick one for my lapel
But you know there are too many insects watching



I'm afraid they'd tell on me


And here the skies are neither day

Nor night, in this place
Its like my skin would try so hard to hold it back


Where i close my eyes

There's an explosion it comes raining down
There's a smile you smiled at me


Anastasia your disappearance is the thorn in my side

Anastasia you know your absence is the thorn in my side


I think about you every night


And every day every moment since you left here


You were the one that got away as they say
Everyone has an Anastasia
Your disappearance is the thorn in my side



Anastasia You know your absence is the thorn in my side


I kept your room just as you left it

There's not a toy out of place

Just in case the fates are kind and you come back someday
I don't want to live without my little Anastasia


Anastasia your disappearance is the thorn in my side


Anastasia you know your absence is the thorn in my side



Little Anastasia..
(I know you're out there)
And only you can take the thorn from my side
