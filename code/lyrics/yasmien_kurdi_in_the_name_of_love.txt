Song:

I'd still remember
The day we first met
There was love all around
You and me
You gazed at me
Like the morning sun
Shining through my life
But seasons changed
Turned the sun into rain
And love was gone
Now we can't hold on

[Chorus:]

I did everything in the name of love
I did everything
But the fights went on and on
I tried to give in
But you keep on breaking my heart
Can't we just stop
Make it right in the name of love
In the name of love

I can't remember
The last time you said
You will love me forever and ever
If this is true we should make it last
And start over again

We need to change
No more pride and the pain
You'd understand me
'Coz I understand you

(Repeat chorus)

We need to change
No more pride and the pain
You'd understand me
As I understand you

I did everything in the name of love
I did everything
But the fights went on and on
I tried to give in
But you keep on breaking my heart
Can't we just stop
Make it right this time
In the name of love
In the name of love...
