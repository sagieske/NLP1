Song:

Lookin out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my peace of mind

[Chorus:]
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Woman...

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know what was wrong with me
'til your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
Cause if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

[Chorus:]

Oh baby what you've done to me
(done to me)
Oh you make me feel so good inside
(good inside)
And I just wanna be
(wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel
So alive

(repeat chorus)
