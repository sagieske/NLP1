Song:

Adeline
I want you like no other
But I don't have the time
To make sure
That your all mine

All the time
Well not all the time
I must keep in mind
That this time you're finally here

And if you want me to shut up and sing
I can to that
And if you want me to
I can be true
Every day, every day, every day

Adeline
You look just look like your mother
Well she was one of a kind
But now she's gone
And you're in your prime

Day by day
I feel just like a baby in your arms
Like I don't need nothing at all

And if you want me to shut up and sing
I could to that
And if you want me to
I can be true
Every day, every day, every day

(Doo doo doo doo doo da dada da...)

And if you want me to shut up and sing
I can to that
And if you want me to
I can be true
Every day, every day, every day

Adeline
