Song:

Baby, you're so complicated
The way you're putting me down
And when we go out with your friends
You act like you don't want me around
And I get so frustrated
How everything ends in a fight
Why bring out the candle
When you don't even care to see the light

And every time you make me cry
Every time you make me cry
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more
And every time we start to fight
We never seem to get it right
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more

Baby, we're so complicated
Took a good thing and turn it around
I scream so loudly
And you pretend not to hear the sound
I get so frustrated
I feel like you crossed the line
Sometimes you love me
And sometimes you act like you don't have the time

I'm ready to give up then you remind me why I even started loving you
It's the hardest thing I ever had to do
And I get so frustrated
How everything ends in a fight
And then you tell me you love me
Then change your mind by the end of the night

And every time you make me cry
Every time you make me cry
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more
And every time we start to fight
We never seem to get it right
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more

You're so complicated
I must make an abrupt statement
I just hate that your lust faded
I'm frustrated
I'm suffocating cause you're choking me blue
You push me off the edge and now I'm broken in two
Where half of me decide not to recognize your lies
And the other half of me just wants a moment of truth
My emotions are through
Twisted like the chains of a park's swing
Cause you're a puppeteer pulling on my heart strings
You're an alien mothership with a tracker beam
Pulling me, attracting me back into this catastrophe
I put novacaine on my soul again
But still the pain hurts, let me clarify exactly how my brain works
I love you and I hate you
I love you but I hate you
I love you but I hate you
I wanna leave but I'll be back I'm sure
But every time you make me cry, I love you that much more

And every time you make me cry
And every time you make me cry
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more
And every time we start to fight
We never seem to get it right
And every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more

And every time you make me cry
And every time you make me cry
Every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more
And every time we start to fight
We never seem to get it right
Every time you make me cry
I love you a little bit more

And every time we start to fight
We never seem to get it right
It always come back too
You're so complicated
