Song:

I can fell the light from your eyes
Racing my mind
Fighting back the tears of my life
For the last time
You can take the crown from your head
Losing it soon
I can taste the end of your dream
Empire Ruined

Can you hear them calling
Can you feel the hurt
Can you see them watching now
Can you hear them calling
Can you make another round
Can you see them dancing now

I can see the light from your eyes
Bounce from the moon
Walking down the valley by night
Leaving here soon

Can you hear them calling
Can you feel the hurt
Can you see them watching now
Can you hear them calling
Can you make another round
Can you see her dancing now

I'm not lucky
You're not lucky
We're not lucky, no!

I'm not crying
You're not buying
You won't take it slow

Solo

Everybody's leaning on you
Nothing seems to break at all for you
Everybody's screaming at you
Ooooh
Chasing after you

I can see the light from the sky
Melt in your eyes

Can you hear them calling
Can you feel the hurt
(They'll) never let her out!!!!!
