Song:

I was sitting on a wooden stool
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee
When this ole boy walked in
And he sat right down next to me
I could tell he'd been through some hard Times
Cause There were tearstains on his old shirt
And he said "ya wanna know what ya get
When you play a country song backwards? "

Ya get your house back
Ya get your dog back
Ya get your best friend Jackson back
Ya get your truck back
Ya get your hair back
Ya get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Goin dinga linga ling
Your bling bling bling
And a diamond ring
Ya get your farm and a barn and the boat And the harley
That old black cat named Charlie
Sounds a little crazy, a little scattered And absurd
But that's what you get when you play a Country song backwards

Well I never heard it said quite like that
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at
I almost fell flat out on the floor
He said "Wait a minute, that's not all There's even more"

Ya get your mind back
Your nerves back
Your achy breaky heart back
You get your pride back,
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen tv,
A dvd and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
And rake and the mower
You go back wher life was slower
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards

Oh play that song

Wooh

We sat there and talked about how life used to be
About how it would be
If we could just rewind it all
And go back in T-I-M-E

Ya get your house back
Ya get your dog back
Ya get your best friend Jackson back
Ya get your truck back
Ya get your hair back
Ya get your first and second jobs back
Your front porch swing
Goin dinga linga ling
Your bling bling bling
And a diamond ring
Ya get your farm and a barn and the boat And the harley
That old black cat named Charlie
Ya get your mind back
Your nerves back
Your achy breaky heartback
You get your pride back,
You get your life back
You get your first real love back
You get your big screen tv,
A dvd and a washing machine
You get the pond and the lawn
The bed and the mower
You get to go back where you
Don't know her
It sounds a little crazy
A little scattered and absurd
But that's what you get
When you play a country song backwards!

Hey yeah eee yeah
