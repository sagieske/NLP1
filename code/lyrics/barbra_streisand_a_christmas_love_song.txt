Song:

All I want for Christmas is you
Your the gift that's made my dreams all come true
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes
Waiting there for me underneath the tree
We'll the spend the day exchanging kisses
Smile and say What a Christmas this is
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsle silver glow
You just look at me and Oh!
Christmas is here!
We will smile and say What a Christmas
This is
Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells or mistletoe
Or the tinsle silver glow
You just have to look at me and Oh!
Christmas is here...
