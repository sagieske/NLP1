Song:

When I'm down, really yin
And I don't know what I'm doing
Aisumasen, aisumasen yoko
All I had to do was call your name
All I had to do was call your name

And when I hurt you and cause you pain
Darlin I promise I won't do it again
Aisumasen, aisumasen yoko
It's hard enough I know just to feel your own pain
It's hard enough I know to feel, feel your own pain

All that I know is just what you tell me
All that I know is just what you show me

When I'm down, real sanpaku
And I don't know what to do
Aisumasen, aisumasen yoko san
All I had to do was call your name
Yes, all I had to do was call your name
