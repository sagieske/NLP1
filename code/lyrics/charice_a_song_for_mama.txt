Song:

You taught me everything
And everything you've given me
I'll always keep it inside
You're the driving force
In my life, yeah
There isn't anything
Or anyone that I can be
And it just wouldn't feel right
If I didn't have you by my side
You were there for me
To love and care for me
When skies were grey
Whenever I was down
You were always there
To comfort me
And no one else can be
What you have been to me
You'll always be
You will always be the girl
In my life for all times

[Chorus:]
Mama
Mama you know I love you
(Oh you know I love you)
Mama
Mama
You're the queen of my heart
Your love is like
Tears from the stars
Mama I just want you to know
Lovin' you
Is like food to my soul

(Yes it is, yes it is, ohhhhh
Yes it is, yes it is, yes it is
Oohhhh)
You're always there for me
Have always been around for me
Even when I was bad
You showed me
Right from my wrong
(Yes you did)
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin' me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There was so many times
Looking back
When I was so afraid
And then you come to me
And saaaayyyy
I can face anything
And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be
You will always be
The girl in my life
(Oooo, oohh)

[Chorus:]

Never gonna go
A day without you
Fill's me up
Just thinking about you
I'll never go a day
Without my mama
