Song:

Colors blind my eyes & angels stifle my cries
I feel so light, can't fight
Sinking down, sinking down...
The tide rolls, the tide rolls on
An endless wave of shit
Another trend like another diseased
Monster is spawned
We're it's creators and soon
We'll all be consumed by it (buy it)
All that seems or seems or seems to be
Is nothing but a dream within a dream
Come join the drowntide
