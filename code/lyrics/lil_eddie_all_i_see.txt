Weekend has arrived everybody's tryin to find something to get into
My friends wanna go out but I can't cancel my plans
Got a date with my baby she's taking me out so I'm gonna catch up with you some other day gotta go can't make her wait tonight have to make sure I'm looking hot 'cause we're going to our favourite spot till the morning we're gonna rock(girl you rock me up)

My baby doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us all I see is you right now they're playing our song dancefloor is ours(all I see is you) the dj's got me feelin' like I did when I first met you and there's nothing that can't break us apart in 2 'cause all I see is you

I get lost in time when you're lookin'in my eyes and we're body to body I don't want you to rush 'cause you're feeling like heaven to me follow the rhythm and keep it real close in the dark everthing goes love it better when you touch baby 'cause we've just begun have to make sure I'm looking hot 'cause we're going to our favourite spot till the morning we're gonna rock(girl you knock me out)

My baby doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us all I see is you right now they're playing our song dancefloor is ours(all I see is you) the dj's got me feelin' like I did when I first met you and there's nothing that can't break us apart in 2 'cause all I see is you

My baby doesn't matter what's going on or who's around us all I see is you right now they're playing our song dancefloor is ours(all I see is you) the dj's got me feelin' like I did when I first met you and there's nothing that can't break us apart in 2, all I see is you baby, oh baby
