Song:

Will you turn my mind away from
Everything that I haven't done
Hope is falling away from me
Hope is falling away from me
Lets go down with the ship
Lets slip into oblivion
Lets go down with the ship
Lets slip into, lets slip into
The blue
Will you turn my mind away from
Everything that I haven't done
Hope is falling away from me
Hope is falling away from me
Lets go down with the ship
Lets slip into oblivion
Lets go down with the ship
Lets slip into, lets slip into
The blue
