Song:

Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words,
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.

(George sings harmonies here)

I get so lonely, when you're away
I count every moment, I wait every day,
Until you're home again
And hug me so tight
That's when I know
Everything is alright.

Like a bird without wings
That longs to be flying,
Like a motherless child
Left lonely and crying.
Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me.

(George sings harmonies here)

You're my guardian angel
My light and my guide
Your hand on my shoulder
And you by my side.
You make everything beautiful,
You make me complete.
Everything in my world
I lay at your feet...

Like a church with no steeple,
Where a bell never rings.
In a town without people,
Where no voice in the choir ever sings.
If a boat on the ocean
Would be lost with no sail,
Then without your devotion
Surely all that I dreamed of would fail.

(George doing harmonies)

Like a song without words
Like a world without music,
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me

I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost without you
Watchin' over me
