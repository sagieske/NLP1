Song:

Shake Shake Shake

So you feel you can't go on
You've got nothing left to lose
But there is no one left to love
You got nothing left to choose

Can't stop
Can't stop at yesterday
Cause we gotta move on in a different way
Today is another day
Can't stop now today is another day

You can't stop, this love
Shake it, Shake it, Shake, Shake it, Shake it
You can't stop, this love
Can't stop now, got to keep moving
We've got faith in what love can do
Don't look back we're gonna make it through
Can't stop now, got to keep moving

Feel you got nowhere to run
That there is nothing we can do
You have so much left to love
In the end there's always me and you

You can't stop
Can't stop at yesterday
Cause we gotta move on in a different way
Today is another day
Can't stop now today is another day

You can't stop, this love
Shake it, Shake it, Shake, Shake it, Shake it
You can't stop, this love
Can't stop now, got to keep moving
We've got faith in what love can do
Don't look back we're gonna make it through
Can't stop now, got to keep moving

Come on; front-back-middle-to top we keep it grooving
No more sad songs singing the blues, we keep it movin
You can't stop, Can't stop at yesterday
Cause we gotta move in a different way
No more sad songs songs singing the blues, we keep it movin (Can Move)

You know we don't stop, even when the wheels lock
(Moving it, Moving it)
And when the beat knock, people in the street rock(x2)
