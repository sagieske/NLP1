Song:

Never realized how much she brought to the table
'Till I went to sit my cup of coffee where the table used to be
No couch, no bed, no heirloom antique cradle
No more hope for one day startin' that family
Bet she's gainin' fast on Memphis
With a trailer load in tow
Who says you can't take it with you till you go

Chorus:
She got away with everything that I had goin'
And she got away before I could make it all alright
And I got a way with leavin' what needs said unspoken
Hell I even blew the chance I had to say goodbye
Yeah she took her heart and took off down that road
And they say you can't take it with you when you go

Good news is ain't much here left for packin'
Bad new is she left behind a million memories
All the echoes of her cryin' lovin' and laughin'
Left me with nothin' left to do but leave
That old house is in the rearview, ridin' shotgun is her ghost
Who says you can't take it with you when you go

(Repeat Chorus)

Closin' in on Dallas now
Is the best love I've ever known
And they say you can't take it with you when you go
