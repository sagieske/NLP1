Song:

Don't piss down my back then tell me it is raining.

You just had to walk in before I kicked the table beneath my feet.
If I can't have any friends I thought why not hang from the ceiling.

Just because I ordered, doesn't mean I can't look at the menu.
Not that there's any other fish in this sea I'd rather have on my plater than you.
Just because I f*****g ordered, doesn't mean I can't look at the menu.
Not that there's any other fish in this sea.

Don't drink and park, accidents in cars cause population.
F**k "more the merrier" there's only one person I need to feel this sinstation.

If you need directions you can take the road that's down my sleeve,
This time I'm taking you with me, but the cuffs are you; so good luck trying to leave!

I hope one day I can cross your ocean, without feeling the puncture of your teeth.
Believe me I'd rather drown myself, then knowing you have the power to pull me beneath.

[X2]
There's so much oxygen that I forgot to breathe...
You're only making things worse, you're only making things worse (I find my self running backwards every time).

[X2]
F**k that I changed my f*****g mind
Jesus loves you so I won't have to.
[X2]
I hope you sleep softly with this pillow pressed against your face
