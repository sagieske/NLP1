Song:

I'm finding out how hot
An old flame can burn
You're a feeling I haven't forgot
The love I can't unlearn
You've become a memory
I can't live without
You'll always be a fire I can't put out

I don't know how to handle
The dream you left behind
It's like a lighted candle
Burning up my mind
At least I'm happy knowing
What love is all about
You'll always be a fire I can't put out

Embers to ashes
That's how it should be
You'd think by know my heart would know
And it could set you free
The things I've tried
The tears I've cried
I guess there's no doubt
You'll always be a fire I can't put out

I don't know how to handle
The dream you left behind
It's like a lighted candle
Burning up my mind
At least I'm happy knowing
What love is all about
You'll always be a fire I can't put out

What love is all about
You'll always be a fire I can't put out
