Song:

Magick speaks with tongues of Fire, Fortune take my hand
Iron pounding dongs of Glory, Soaring on command
Screaming I rejoin the fray

Take me where the thunder walks, A symphony of steele
Take my where the falcon flies, A symphony of steele

Sound the trumpet, crack the mountain, let the arrow fly
Through the land of Lamentation, let the tidings fly
Mercury, the God and I

[?]-Take me where the thunder walks, A symphony of steele
Take me where the falcon flies, A symphony of steele

Spark the ashes, free the temple, stem the crimson tide
Toll the bells of Freedom souting
Praise for those who've died
Wield the Sword of Destiny

[?]
A symphony of steele

If passion denies you, don't die on your knees
Fight with a vengeance what weakness decrees
The Wrath of the Tempest, the cries of the slain
Tragic in splendor, in death you are free
I follow the Sign, bring on the sound of thunder,
Bring on the rain
Spirit of Dark Enchantment remember my name!!!
