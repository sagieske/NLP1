Song:

Well sweetness, I love it when you wrap me up
I'm a drowning man for the third time
Twenty-one gun salute in your flag of mercy
Preparing my body for a burial at sea

So put your tongue in my ear
Through this veil of tears
Whisper what's gone wrong? Gone wrong?
The world, the world she's a Babylon

Coming in from the coast it's a bad nor'easter
Waves banging rocks with migraine vengeance
Build up the tower, unlocking the secrets
The pride of man is so contentious

This is no pleasure cruise in the South Pacific
I'm bailing ice water up to my neck
Titanic's captain said that God couldn't sink her
You might say he learned a healthy respect
