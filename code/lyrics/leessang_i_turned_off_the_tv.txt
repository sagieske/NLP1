Song:

I love you so much so I turn off the tv
Your red lips
I love you so much so I close the curtains
Your red lips
I love you so much so I turn off the tv
Your red lips
I love you so much so I close the curtains
Your red lips

In my eyes, your body has the most beautiful lines than anything else
Your dark hair, I melt in it's scent
Sometimes I imagine things and I become greedy
When I watch tv, when I walk, I want you all the time
I can't suppress it, how can I just hold your hand?
Don't sound so hard on me, you're the one who made me hard
I love you so much, I wannna give you my everything and have your everything
I wanna hug you closer, I wanna wet my body and pat your bottom

I wanna show you all night
You will cry when you see a different me from yesterday
I wanna show you all night
You're so lovely, you always make my heart flutter baby

*Repeat

Why did you just close the curtains when it's so hot?
Why did you just turn off the tv?
Why are you looking at me like that, setting the mood?
I'm tired, I'm tired, let's just sleep
I wanna dream in your arms all night
Stop whining, tonight is not the only night
Not tonight baby, come on my angel, let's just sleep
Don't get mad and hold my hand
Why are you turning your back against me like a child?
Oh come on, you're so silly
I'll think about it, go turn off the lights

I can't sleep like this, you're so beautiful
I can't just let tonight go like this
Don't say no tonight, no no no

*Repeat

You make my heart flutter
