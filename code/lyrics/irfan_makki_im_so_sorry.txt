Song:

If my time would end today would I be ready to go?
And leave all the things I've worked so hard for
And all my friends and everyone I've known?
Never did I ever stop for a moment to think
Of what's staring at me
I've been breaking all the mirrors of reality

[Chorus:]:
I'm so sorry, if only I had just one last chance
I'm so sorry, but now it's too late to change the past, oh

I lived my life in the fast lane, I only lived for today
And never, never really thought about anyone else
It was all about me, myself and I
Never did I ever stop for a moment to think
Of what's staring at me
I've been breaking all the mirrors of reality, oh

[Chorus:]

And now, now that it's over
I wonder if anyone will remember me
If I had the chance to turn back the hands of time
There are so many things that I would change
I'd live my life, every single breath... For You

(Piano Solo)

[Chorus:]

[Outro:]:
I'm so sorry, so sorry
Please forgive me
