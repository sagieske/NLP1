Song:

Been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours for what
Now tell me, what have I got
I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling or else I'll tear up this town

[Chorus:]
Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off my sunday shoes
Please louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some-
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

[Chorus:]
You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your sunday shoes
Oohee marie, shake it, shake it for me
Oh milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

Cut footloose, cut footloose, cut footloose

First we've got to turn you around
Second, put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul

I'm telling you loose
Footloose, kick off your sunday shoes
Please louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose
Kick off your sunday shoes
Please louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody, everybody cut footloose
