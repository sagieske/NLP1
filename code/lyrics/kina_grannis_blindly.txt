Song:

I've been walking down this road too long, too far
And I'm thinking it's time that I turn back.
I'm losing myself in my own confusing rhythms
In the path from heart to brain I lack.

Wish the things I felt were clearer
Like the moonlight over me tonight.
You know all I want's to have you nearer
And a love so high that we'd take flight.

[Chorus:]
So long my ways, I wont miss you
I'll be all right this time.
Follow the lines and dreams can come true.
Just feel my way and shut out the light.

Don't understand how I can know
Just how and why I ought to feel
And then when it comes to feeling that feeling
My head stops it from being real

I wish that I could see right through you
To see just what you see in me
I get so scared someday I'll lose that, lose you
When you look inside and I'm empty

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
But I won't forget
That first time I said those words
Though in my head, I know
It meant something more than this
Find my feelings, save them from the part of me
That confuses everything, when i knew all along
That my heart was never wrong

[Chorus]
