Song:

Don't learn while you get spoonfed
What are you stupid ?
Believe everything inside your head
What are you stupid ?
Stick to the way you're born and bred
What are you stupid ?
A bond is a drag in the end
Yeah, you're stupid, stupid !

These are the words, but they don't make contact
These are the words
These are the words, but they don't make contact
These are the words
These are the words, but they don't make contact
These are the words

Wanna teach but you can't even reach
That's real stupid
Allow these deeds to keep up the peace
Yeah, you're stupid
All this speech separates one and each
Say it's stupid
But can I meet you along the way
Please, or is this stupid, stupid !

Explain the unexplainable to your fellowman
What are you stupid
Get hurt by someone's poisonous pen
What are you stupid
Say no words while you wanna be heard
What are you stupid
Action speaks louder than words
Yeah, you're stupid
