Song:

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me,
“Son, it's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing…

Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, and life, and love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when.

And my father told me,
“Son, it's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say
That he used to sing…

Darlin' hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, and life, and love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh

And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
