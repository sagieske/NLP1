Song:

Ring, ring it's you again heart pops
I loved to hear you
It's been all day I've been waiting for you
Hello, you call my name
So much stories you shared with me
You said a lot to me about girls
Oh, it's so nice
And every beauty thing they did to you
Don't stop and tell me more'

Chorus: Loving you it hurt sometimes
I'm standing here you just don't buy
I'm always there you just don't feel
Or you just don't wanna feel
Don't wanna be hurt that way
It doesn't mean I'm givin' up
I wanna give you more
And more and more'

Knock, knock you came around heart pops
I loved to see you
It's been two years since I'm love with you
Bum! Bum! You break my heart
You said, girl I'm in love with her
But it's all right, I'm still alive yeah' ohh'
And all the beauty things she did to you
Don't stop and tell me more

Back to: Chorus

And when I see that smile upon your face
Deep in your eyes you had it all
And when I hear you super electrical voices'

Back to: Chorus (2x)
