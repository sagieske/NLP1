Song:

Word gets out when this just started out that everything would turn out
This way, 
At first it was a phone call then it was another from a mother who was ready to play
And she said things that no one ever told me before
How could I have known that she wanted to settle the score?

Then a man came in
I can probably see it and it looks like you're having fun
And when I get back
You're gonna be bleeding so I think son you'd better run
Now I think
I should have been leaving cause it looks like I've got enough
She was the deceiver
But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
She told me she was in love

I thought I could fix it in just another minute
But I guess it was a minute too late
I know he was coming
And I should have been running
If he'd caught me I would never escape
Now I know it never should have been a surprise
How could I have know that she was only telling me lies

Cos a man came in
I thought you were leaving but I see you're still having fun
But now I'm get back
You're gonna be bleeding so I think son you'd better run
Now I see
I should have been leaving cause it looks like I've got enough
She was the deceiver
But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
She told me she was in love

Don't blame me, 
It's not my fault, 
Don't blame me, 
I'm not the one

Cause The man came in, 
I thought you were leaving but I see you're still having fun
Now I'm back
You're gonna be bleeding so I think son you'd better run
Now I see
I should have been leaving cause it looks like I've got enough
She was the deceiver
But I had to believe her when she told me she was in love
She told me she was in love
