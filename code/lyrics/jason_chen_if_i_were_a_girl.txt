Song:

If I were a girl
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
Put up all my makeup and go
Go shop with the girls
And get my nails done
I would flirt with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Because theyd cover for me

If I were a girl
I think I could understand
What it mean to love a man
I swear I'd do the best I can
I'd listen to him
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause she's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a girl
I would turn off my phone
I would lie and say it's broken
So he wouldn't know
That I'm unfaithful
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know hell always be there
Faithfully, waiting at home (waiting at home)
