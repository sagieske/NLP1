Song:

There were times in my life when I was confused.
There were things between me and God that were blocking my view.
So I prayed,
"Oh dear Lord, take these things away so I can see."
He answered my prayer and at the sight of Him
I fell to my knees.

And until I went onto that fateful trip.
I thought I was on a sinking ship.

Until,
I went on a balloon ride
(I could see everything from up there).
I went on a balloon ride
And now everything seems clear.

I strive towards infinity.
Though sometimes I don't know what to do.
When other people laugh at me
All I do is look towards You.

Well on my through this life yet something was gone.
I looked round and round and then I found I needed some one.
So I prayed,
"Oh dear Lord, fill me up and make me whole.
Present in my life Jesus Christ, save my soul. "
