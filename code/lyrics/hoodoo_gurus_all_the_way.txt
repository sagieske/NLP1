Song:

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Maybe I've been leading you nowhere
We won't know until we arrive
Either way we're certain of one thing
We know we're alive

Maybe I'm the wrong person for you
Wonder will I ever be right?
You won't wish for anyone better
Not after tonight

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Life could never teach me its lessons
I knew the words but I couldn't spell
Now you've taught me forwards and backwards
I'm learning too well, I'm learning too well

Do we care if anyone sees us ?
We won't be the first or the last
Makin' love wherever we please,
The sign say, "Keep off the grass"
(So, we sleep on the grass)

May be unkind
(May be unkind)
But baby, unwind
(Baby, unwind)

You're too tight, you're too tight
(Baby, won't you please unwind?)
You can lose your grip tonight

Could be I'm the wrong person for you
Wonder if I'll ever be right
You won't wish for anyone better
Not after tonight, not after tonight
I said, not after tonight

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey)
Take me all the way

Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, all the way)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, all the way)
