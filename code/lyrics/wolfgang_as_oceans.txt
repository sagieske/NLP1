Song:

(Vocals - basti)
Close your eyes and rise as oceans
Breathin' floatin' across the waves
Underneath you all sorts of emotions
As this blue horizon calls
And no God or man can control where you roam
As current serves my motor
I'm pushin'
Now awake! Like the oceans feel your waves
Tentacles to crash rocks on shores
Tides devoid of emotions
All your wonderful dreams washed away
As I stand on the sand dragged by your hand
Like an anchor that's bringin' me
Down below the water
'Cause man He can control where you roam
Now rest as oceans
Be still,
Still yet in constant motion
Quiet but never afraid
Silent but always awake
And no God nor man can dictate where you stand
No bouderies cast forever
You last forever.
As the ocean calls your name
