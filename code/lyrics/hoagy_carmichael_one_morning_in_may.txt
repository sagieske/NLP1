Song:

One morning in May, don't forget, dear
That one wonderful day when we met, dear
The world over was blue clover
And hearts carefree and g**

One morning in May, oh, the rapture
Tonight darling, I pray to recapture
Just one hour, just one flower
From love's faded bouquet

Kisses that came with the flame of springtime
Burning your name in my heart
Precious to me like a rosary
Now that we're apart

One morning in May to remember
The love smolders away to an ember
And dreams perish, we'll still cherish
That one, one morning in May

The world over was blue clover
And hearts carefree and g**

One hour, just one flower
From loves faded bouquet

Kisses that came with the flame of springtime
Burning your name in my heart
They're so precious to me like a rosary
Now that we're apart

One morning in May to remember
The love smolders away to an ember
And dreams perish, we'll still cherish
That one, one morning in May
