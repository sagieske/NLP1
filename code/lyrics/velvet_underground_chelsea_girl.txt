Song:

Here's Room five four six
It's enough to make you sick
Bridget's all wrapped up in foil
You wonder if
She can uncoil
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Here's Room One fifteen
Filled with sm queens
Magic marker row
You wonder just
How high they go
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Here's Pope dear Ondine
Rona's treated him so mean
She wants another scene
She wants to be
A human being
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Pepper she's having fun
She thinks she's some men's son
Her perfect loves don't last
Her future died
In someone's past
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Dear Ingrid's found her lick
She's turned another trick
Her treats and times revolves
She's got problems
To be solved
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Poor Mary, she's uptight
She can't turn out her light
She rolled Susan in a ball
And now she can't
See her at all
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Drop out, she's in a fix
Amphetamine has made her sick
White powder in the air
She's got no bones
And can't be scared
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Here comes Johnny Bore
He collapsed on the floor
They shut him up with milk
And when he died
Sold him for silk
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
Here they come now
See them run now
Here they come now
Chelsea Girls
