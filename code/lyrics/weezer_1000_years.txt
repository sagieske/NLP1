Song:

Starry sky,
Oh starry sky,
Tell me if you can,
Why oh why,
Your famous smile,
Is this in your plan?
(chorus)
Every hour of
Every day,
She'll await for you,
She'll await 1000 years
To save herself for you.

Bible man
Oh bible man,
Tell me if you know,
Why do all these strange events
Wreck upon the shore?

(chorus)

Alone,
Just like the sea
Corroding endlessly,

Every hour of everyday,
She'll await for you

(chorus)

Alone,
Just like the sea
Corroding endlessly,
