Song:

Click your fingers applauding the play
Such clear clear nights and clear days
Cause lightning never flashes our way
If you click your fingers applauding the play

Fat kings and queens all eating their grapes
Blood and blaspheme not upon the door drapes
Scream out for murder, scream out for hate
If you click your fingers applauding the play

And from the horizons the wrath boot's not down
Clear skies sometimes the clouds so inviting
Such a friendly sound

Temples arising are not raked
Columns not shattered by any earthquakes
The seas and famine are all their own brake
If you click your fingers applauding the play

And from the horizons the wrath boot's not down
Clear skies sometimes the clouds so inviting
Such a friendly sound
