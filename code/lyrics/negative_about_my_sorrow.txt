Song:

From chains to freedom
From hate to love
One by one

Slowly crying and shedding tears
Love's starving
You need forgiveness
For mortal sins
Everything is blackened

From light to darkness
You will survive
Still go on, you won't be alone

Lay down with me
For tomorrow
I will be waiting
Lay down with me
Maybe tomorrow
Love won't be waiting

When your heart is empty
And consolation is all you need
Your heart is surrounded with a broken shield
No consolation, no bitter tears

Lay down with me
For tomorrow
I will be waiting
Lay down with me
Maybe tomorrow
Love won't be waiting

One last forgiveness
One last temptation
You're all I need

From light to darkness
From hate to love
That's what we are

Lay down with me
For tomorrow
I will be waiting
Lay down with me
Maybe tomorrow
Love won't be waiting

Lay down with me
For tomorrow
I will be waiting
Lay down with me
Maybe tomorrow...
Love will be waiting.
