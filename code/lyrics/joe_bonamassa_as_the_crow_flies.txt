Song:

As the crow flies baby
And I ain't so far from you
As the crow flies baby
And I ain't so far from you

Well I don't have wings
And I can't get home like I want to

In a dream last night
Well I heard you call my name
In a dream last night
Well I heard you call my name

Well I took it as an omen
And I jumped on that next train
Oh whoa

Well you don't know baby
How I miss your sweet caress
Well you don't know baby
How I miss your sweet caress

When I'm in your lovin' arms
And I swear I'm at my very best

As the crow flies baby
