I gotta tell you this too, you know, I'm a short f****r, you know, like I said, I gotta, I work purely off personality. I aint got a problem with it. If I was tall I'd probably be stupid, I'm just guessing, I don't know.
But you tall fuckers got it good when it comes to walking in the bedroom, just dropping your drawers. "Oh my god what the fu-"You know. We, Us short fuckers gotta be creative. I came up with something. Put on a wig, and talk with an accent. I brought my wig with me, I'd like to share it with you:

Hello my name is Carlos.
I want to make love to you.
I want you to get on the bed, and take off your panties, do as I say.
Hurry girlfriend, right now, okay.
Then I want you to pretend that your feet hate each other, do as I say.
Heh, you drunk fuckers'll try to use that line tonight. Every one of you will f**k it up too "Get up dere on the bed and pretend your feet stink.Well I can't remember what he sed just get your panties off!!I want a lil pootie poo."
One of you girls tonight will be lucky enough to have your hiney spanked by Carlos. Who will it be?

As I walk on to the stage,
Tonight I turn another page,
Another nitch up in my cup,
I will sit down in your lap,
Look at you you turn me o-oon,
I squeeze your b***s when we're alo-oone
I am caught up in your trap...
I hope she don't give me the clap

Okay, I play.
Thanks for coming out, Good Night!
