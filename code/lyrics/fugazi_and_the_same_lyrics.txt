Song:

Yes I know this is politically correct
But it comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
That is if you believe in race
Rr that you were born in the right time or place
That is a thought about face your way of thinking
Your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found out a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction.
If you have to carry a gun
To keep your fragile seat at number one
This is a bullet you can't outrun...
Your way of thinking
So wait and see it's coming round
Conscripted through the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound...
Your way of thinking your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction
Action. Reaction. Action. Reaction.
