Song:

I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel.
Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you.
I was dreaming as I drove the long, straight road ahead....
Uh-huh, yeah.
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide.
This fever for you was just burning me up inside.

*Chorus*
I drove all night to get to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room, woke you from your sleep,
To make love to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night.

What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear the beating of our one heart.
I think about you when the night is cold and dark....
Uh-huh, yeah. No one can move me the way that you do,
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you.

*Chorus
I drove all night to get to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room,
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night.
I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide.
This fever for you was burning me up inside.

I drove all night to get to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night, crept in your room,
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you. Is that all right?
I drove all night.
