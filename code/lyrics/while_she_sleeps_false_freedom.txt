Song:

I've lost too many times to see. This crooked cross will
Never save me
F**k belief, This is reason, We won't know what is next
Until it's gone
I'm glad I'm on my own, I'm glad I'm on my own
I'm happy knowing I've got nothing to prove
I'm glad I'm on my own, I'm glad I'm on my own
Alive and knowing I've got nothing to lose
I've lost too many times to see, this crooked cross will
Never save me
F**k belief, this is reason
I look to open skies and see, the net of safety tied down
On me
No more than common myth to help you through the life you
Live
I'll put my hands up high, I'm never going to need the
Burden
I'll but my hands up high, I'm never going to need to
Worship
Let's put an end to this, I'm never going to need the
Burden
Let's put an end to this, I'm never going to need to
Worship
Our guided, our given, Fed to the sun for all you're
Worth without reason
The force-feeding, false freedom. Let's find the meaning
Of peace
Let's find a reason to live.
