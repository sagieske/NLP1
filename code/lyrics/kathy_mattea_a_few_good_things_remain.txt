Song:

I heard a siren late last night, you must have felt me shiver
Shaken by a wave of fright, that you calm with a whisper
And fear gave way to better things
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams

Like a warm spring rain on a roof above
The way you call my name when we make love
While the world outside my window goes insane
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain

When living leaves my pride bruised up, I'm fragile as a feather
The storms of life just won't let up, you're like a change of weather
When dust settles on my dreams, you wash them clean

Like a warm spring rain on a roof above
The way you call my name when we make love
While the world outside my window goes insane
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain

While the world outside my window goes insane
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain
