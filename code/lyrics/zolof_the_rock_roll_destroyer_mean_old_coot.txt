Song:

Hey pea we were playing. We're all so tuckered out.
Sorry I'm becoming a mean old coot as it were.
We stayed until 2. Let's up and get away from here.
And there's hours to go. Let's up and get away from here.
You don't even know.
It's 123 chop!
Calm down. Baby calm down.
If I were you I'd calm down.
We stayed until 2. Let's up and get away from here.
And there's hours to go. Let's up and get away from here.
You don't even know.
It's 123 chop!
