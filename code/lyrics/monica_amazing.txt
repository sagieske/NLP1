Song:

Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Everything I am, everything I was
Has been elevated through the power of your love
Everything I lost, everything I've gained
No longer makes a difference since you changed my name

[Bridge:]
Got my heart beating faster, I can barely catch my breath! 
Boy, your love took the pain from my chest! 
Now I look at us, parallel to the stars
Boy, you claim my heart, you're so amazing! 

[Chorus:]
You are Amazing, when I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me I ain't seen nothing
You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place, show me some better way
Now I should be living my life each and every day
Been through so much, never thought that you would exist
But ain't nobody ever made me feel like this! 
You are amazing! 

Everywhere I've been, everything I've done
All the money fails in comparison to the compassion you show me
Every time that you hold me
And when I'm in your arms, I can do anything for you

[Bridge:]
Got my heart beating faster, I can barely catch my breath! 
Boy, your love took the pain from my chest! 
Now I look at us, parallel to the stars
Boy, you claim my heart, you're so amazing! 

[Chorus:]
You are Amazing, when I thought that I have seen it all
Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Oh na na na

You never left my sight
I was lost, but you found me and saved my life
I could have died, no love inside
Before you I was done inside
But you made me feel again
Boy, I swear you are amazing! 

Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Oh na na na
You are amazing
When I thought that I have seen it all
Came and shown me I ain't seen nothing
You are amazing
When my back was up against the wall
It was you that hit the restart button
Took me to a better place, show me some better way
Now I should be living my life each and every day
Been through so much, never thought that you would exist
And nobody made me feel like this! 
You are amazing! 

Gave me a new life when you made me your wife
Yes you did! 
And I love, love, love you
Is nothing I would not do for you...
