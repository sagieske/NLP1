Song:

We-e-ell, you know you took my heart & broke it apart
Why didn't I, baby, yeah yeah, didn't I know from the start?
You know you took my love, threw it away
Now you're gonna want my love today
Well, bye bye baby

Well I thought your love was oh so true
& you know me, baby, started lovin' you
You know you took my love, threw it away
Now you're gonna want my love today
Well, bye bye baby
Wo

(x2):
Your love was sweet as wine, any I know so
Don't come back runnin' or knockin' on my front door
Well you said that I was your only girl
& there was no other, yeah, in this whole wide world
You know you took my love, threw it away
Now you're gonna want my love today
Well, bye bye baby

Wo bye bye baby, don't you know oh
Bye bye baby, wo, don't need your love
Yeah yeah, I don't want you, baby
Bye bye baby, yeah, bye bye baby
...& fade
