Song:

Oh A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Ya
And A Lifetime Isent Enough To Live
Oh A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Ya
And What Lifetime Isent Enough To Live

I May Be Different Than You
Critisized For What I Do
I Chose To Expose The Truth
The Truth Of Me And I Wont Be Afriad.. On That Day
I Stand On My Feet,Because I Am Yeah
Took A Risk, A Chance Just To Understand
Well I Have Been Cold, For A Savage *
Misunderstood, Yeahh
Light The Lamp I Will Sacrafice To Find You
Cuz A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Ya
And A Lifetime Isent Enough To Live
Oh A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Ya
And What Lifetime Isent Enough To Live

Been Around So Many People
Without You Im All Alone
Gazing Into Space
My Exsistence Are Known
I Dont Want To Be Here, I Want To Be Near.
I Stand On My Feet, Because I Am Yeahh
Took The Risk, A Chance Just To Understood
When I Been Cold For A Savage *.. Misunderstood
Light The Lamp I Will Sacrafice To Find You
Cuz I Lifetime Isent Enough To Love You
And A Lifetime Isent Enough To Live
Oh A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love
And What Lifetime Isent Enough To Live?

Am I So Different Than You?
Critisized For What I Do.
Chose To Expose The Truth.. The Truth Of You
And I Wont Be Afriad , On That Day
I Stand On My Feet, Because I Am Yahh
Took A Risk A Chance Just To Understand
Cuz A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Ya
And A Lifetime Isent Enough To Live
Oh A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love.. Yah
And What Lifetime Isent Enough To Live
Eyy.. A Lifetime Isent Enough To Love Yah
And What Lifetime Isent Enough To Live?
