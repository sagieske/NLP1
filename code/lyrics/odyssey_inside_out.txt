Song:

When you're sitting on your own
And you feel the city life surround you
And she's always on the phone
But you just don't think that you can fight it

Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
Don't give up, don't give up, darling, what you dream

'Cause like the words here in this song
We'll go on and on and on with our love

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
I want it to be so deep that you'll be turning me
(Inside out)
I want it to be so deep you'll be needing me

When you're lying in her bed
And you're in her arms instead of my love
As you feel her tightening grip
Like a genie I will slip from your heart

I won't give up, won't give up, won't give up
(Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up)
Oh, don't give up, darling, what you dream

Like the notes here in this song
We'll go on and on and on and on with our love

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
Oh, I wanna be so deep that you'll be needing me
(Inside out)
Over and over again

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
Oh, I've got to be so deep that you'll be turning me
Turning me, turning me
(Inside out)
Over and over again

(Inside out)
You and I must stay
(Inside out)
Can't believe this way
(Inside out)
You and I must stay
(Inside out)

'Cause I've got to have you, babe

When you're sitting on your own
And you feel the city life surround you
And she's always on that phone
And you just don't think that you got the strength to fight it

Don't give up, don't give up
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
Don't give up, don't give up, darling, what you dream

'Cause like the words here in this song
We'll go on and on and on with our love

(I wanna be)
Inside out, oh, darling
I want it to be so deep that you'll be needing me
(Inside out)
Oh, darling
Oh, I want it to be so deep you'll be turning me, turning me
(Inside out)

Inside out, inside out, oh, darling
Oh, I wanna be so deep that you'll be needing me
