Song:

Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Let's go.

Now!

Everybody in the world, are you with me?
It's to late to try to run, we run the city.
It's my time, it's your time, every time it's don't give a f**k time.
It's go time, it's show time,
Sing it with me everybody, let's go.

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, cause two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, cause two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Let's go.

Let me see you start a war, start a riot,
When there's nothing left to burn, hear the silence.
Hate me, you can't escape me
And you ain't ever gonna change me.
I can't stand it, I've f*****g had it,
I'm about to blow!

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, cause two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, cause two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Let's go.
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Let's go.

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, cause two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Cause it's one! It's one, one for the money.
Two! It's two, two is for the show.
Three! It's three, three get ready,
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go.

Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
Are you rea-ea-ea, are you ready?
