Song:

La da da da ta
I'm gonna bury you in the ground
La da da da ta
I'm gonna bury you in my sound
I'm gonna drink the red from your pretty pink face
I'm gonna... 

Sorry I don't treat you like a goddess, 
Is that what you want me to do?
Sorry I don't treat you like you're perfect, 
Like all your little loyal subjects do.
Sorry I'm not made of sugar, 
Am I not sweet enough for you?
Is that why you always avoid me?
That must be such an inconvenience to you.
Well, I'm just your problem.
I'm just your problem.
It's like I'm not even a person, am I?
I'm just your problem.
Well, I shouldn't have to justify what I do.
I shouldn't have to prove anything to you.
I'm sorry that I exist, 
I forget what landed me on your black list.
But I shouldn't have to be the one that makes up with you.
So, why do I want to? Why do I want to?
To... bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... UGH!
