(Carly simon/Jacob Brackman/Andy Goldmark)

What do the neighbours say
When they hear us scream at night
Do they talk about a love
All in tatters
What do the neighbours know
About the heart and soul
The fire down below
That really matters
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the s*** hurricane
We got here
All I want is you
I don't want a man
To say "good morning dear"
Let 'em listen at the door
Let 'em listen through the floor
Let 'em go ahead and draw the wrong conclusion
So chase me 'round the room
Make me crazy like the moon
They can never guess
In the silences
That all I want is you
And the s*** hurricane that we share
All I want is you
I don't want a man
Who tiptoes up the stairs
All I want is you
And the freight train
Whistling over my track
All I want is you
And your Mack truck loving
Jumping me Jack!
Oh, Jack!
