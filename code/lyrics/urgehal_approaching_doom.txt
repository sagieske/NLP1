Song:

Demonic whips upon a funeral black night sky
Corpsecold soil beneath our cloven hooves
Church fires enlightens the left hand path
Like torches from hell devouring the cross

Thou shall worship Him with fire and blood
Sacrifice thy flesh to the horned god
Fulfill the infernal pacts through the black arts
Signed and drenched in sacrificial blood

For each step my mind grows darker
For each kill my soul grows stronger
Preparing for the apocalyptic war
Through satanic rituals and sorcery

Perform the rites of necromancy
Evoke the unhallowed dead
In sadistic black mass perversions
We seal the oath of the goat

Carve his symbol in thy flesh
Bleed for the lords of hell
Declare war upon the heavens
Kill in His name

Behold His coming
