Song:

I think about the end of the world
I'm thinking about you... 
All the struggle we had, and the past, 
Blood and tears my love! 
How could I forget

In sorrow now, since we fell a part
A million miles away
Still I put my faith on high sky
Everlasting pain! How can I escape... 

I think about the evil ways I've been
The self destruction years... 
I disrespect my self and the world
Chase by ghost of lust
Kill the love ones down

Don't go, don't go away... 
Stay with me here in this lullabies
Darling it won't be long, till we find
Our away back home again... 

I gave up all the poison for you
Gave up the wildest dreams... 
And in the end I'll grow old
With you, only you my love
Burn the fire burns... 

At night when the shadow falls
Wish I'm there just right there
Close by your side! 
This lonesome dreams, I'm haunted by
The memories of rose...
