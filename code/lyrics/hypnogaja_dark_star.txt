Song:

I saw it all
All along
When I looked again
It was almost gone

Fragile sky
Seemed so strong
Was it destiny
That brought this on?

I can see your light fading
The night is contemplating
Will you shine on
Or is it too late?
Darkness casts a shadow brightly
I see the same inside me
Your reflection
Shows me my fate

Dark star
Fading faster

I feel your pain
Come closing in
'Cause what happens next
Will happen then

Scared to die
I won't pretend
More than anything
I'm afraid to meet your end

I can see your light fading

Dark star
Fading faster
