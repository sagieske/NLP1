Song:

Something in your eyes
Makes me wanna lose myself
Makes me wanna lose myself
In your heart

Something in your voice
Makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling will last
The rest of my life

If you knew
How lonely my life has been
And how low I've felt for so long
If you knew
I wanted someone to come along
And change my world
The way you've done

It feels like home
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my way back
Where I come from
Feels like home
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my wayback
Where I'm from

With your embrace
Down a long dark street
And a sigh of wind in the night
It's alright
Cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see
The dark feels light

If you knew
How much this moment means to me
Ad how long I've waited for your touch
I you knew
I wanted someone to come along
I never thought I'd love anyone
So much

Feels like home
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm on my way to where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like I'm on my way back to where I belong
