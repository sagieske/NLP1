Song:

What's up girl
Ohhh ohhh ohhh

She's a weekend beauty queen of the black like clubs wearing out the scene 
You know her type out all night
Starry eyed for the dirty dream always looking for the prince where the
Cash is king
On the boulevard in a big black car 
She's everywhere you are

I smell her sweet perfume making rounds around the room 
Cause she is a downtown girl a downtown girl 
Her lips are red and those hips are turning heads 
Cause she's a downtown girl a downtown girl a downtown downtown girl girl
A downtown downtown girl ohhh 

Living like a celebrity all the guys lined up and the drinks are free 
She's knows she's hot but that's all she got
Everybody knows she's on the move with her six inch heels and an attitude
To seal the deal she shots to kill but I'm not going down 

I smell her sweet perfume making rounds around the room 
Cause she's a downtown girl a downtown girl 
Her lips are red and those hips are turning heads 
Cause she's a downtown a downtown girl a downtown downtown girl girl a
Downtown downtown girl girl 

Likes the attention gets the attention her name is on the bathroom wall (
Her name is on the bathroom wall ) 
The party never over she's always coming over even when the music stops

I smell her sweet perfume making rounds around the room cause she's a
Downtown girl a downtown girl 
Her lips are red and those hips are turning heads 
Cause she's a downtown girl a downtown girl 

All the boys staring at the girls 
Staring at the boys 
Staring at the downtown girls the downtown girls
Her lips are red and those hips are turning heads 
Cause she's a downtown girl a downtown girl 

A downtown downtown girl girl a downtown downtown girl girl a downtown
Downtown girl girl a downtown downtown girl girl ohhh 

A downtown downtown girl girl a downtown downtown girl girl
