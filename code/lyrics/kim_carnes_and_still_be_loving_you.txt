Song:

(Kim Carnes/Dave Ellingson)

You're the poets finest song
And like a painter you can move me with your sunrise
Touch me with the look I see in your eyes
And I fall again

In the silence after love
With the words that go unsaid I'll understand you
Things may not work out the way we've planned them to
But I'll fall again

Loves been called a game
Winner takes it all
And everyone who plays
Plays knowing he could fall
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you

When the love songs have all been sung
And time has taken down it's last December
You will be the one love I'll remember and I'll fall again
For like the fool I am
I'll be the pawn again
Move me as you will
I've always given in
And if love's a game
I'd rather lose to you
Than win with someone else
And still be loving you
