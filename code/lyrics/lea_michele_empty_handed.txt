Song:

If I came to you empty handed
Abandoned ocean
With nothing at all
And if I came to you empty handed
Searching for pieces
After the fall
All I've ever known is how to hide a secret
But I'm tired of going on without believing
And love is not illusion, love illuminates bright

If I fell into you, would it be close enough
If I finally let you in, would you show me what love is
If I had nothing to give

If you came to me empty handed
I'll bring the ocean to bring you home
And if you came to me empty handed
I'll find the pieces to make you fall

If I fell into you, would it be close enough
If I finally let you in, would you show me what love is
If I had nothing to give

If I am a promise
Would you let me break again
I would be your congress, and I will only let you ban
All I've ever known is how to hide a secret
But I'm tired of going on without believing
And love is not illusion, love illuminates bright

If I fell into you, would it be close enough
If I finally let you in, would you show me what love is
If I had nothing to give

If I had nothing to give
