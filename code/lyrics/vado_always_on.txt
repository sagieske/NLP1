Song:

They say I couldn't make it
Been down so long I couldn't take it
Go hard be strong but be patient
Pray before you eat and be gracious
Hard beat and sweat tripping
F... so let's get it
No job... with it... needs some help with it
Dark nights park lights
24 hour practice that's how I got nice
Lights camera action in the spot light
Never get burned I will show turn I got right
As the crime stand on the platform
On it's way to the bench team... 
... how did they react to them
I am always on stand... I am always strong
Even when I am always wrong I am always on
Go hard you will be always on
Go hard you will be always known
... everybody clap for him
... everybody clap for him

They say I ain't great wore more and less I ain't... 
Reaching my goals to the... fear nothing trust life
Whenever I mission you came right... can't take it
I am tired on my way to word... jump high I got higher
... on it's way to the bench team... 
... how did they react to them
I am always on stand... I am always strong
Even when I am always wrong I am always on
Go hard you will be always on
Work hard you will be always known
... everybody clap for him
... everybody clap for him
I am always on

I ain't afraid to live it up
... stand I gotta get it up
... I did it up... they have been trying to... 
I am always on
I am always on stand... I am always strong
Even when I am always wrong I am always on
Go hard you will be always on
Work hard you will be always known
... everybody clap for him
... everybody clap for him
I am always on
I am always on
I am always on
