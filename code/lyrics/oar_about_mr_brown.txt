Song:

What can you say about tomorrow?
What do you know about my life?
What do you say to your daughter?
What do you tell to your wife?
A la la la eh eh
A la la la eh oh
A la la la eh eh
Say Mr. Brown how about your daughter.
Do you know what she's done tonight?
And do you agree that we are lost here?
Well, among the lost we shall survive.
A la la la eh eh
A la la la eh oh
A la la la eh eh x2
What's that you say when the rain wont go away?
What's that you do when no ones looking at you?
Wheres that you go after the show?
What's that you say?
A hey hey hey
Say Mr. Brown how about this weather?
Is it gonna rain on our parade?
Is your soul as light as a feather?
Or am I Flat out going insane?
A la la la eh eh
A la la la eh oh
A la la la eh eh
Say Mr. Brown how about your brother.
Do you know what he's done with his life?
While you're chasing him out the front door,
Hes chasing you with a butcher knife.
A la la la eh eh
A la la la eh oh
A la la la eh eh x2
What's that you say when the rain wont go away?
What's that you do when no ones looking at you?
Wheres that you go after the show?
What's that you say? (Repeat)
A hey hey hey
