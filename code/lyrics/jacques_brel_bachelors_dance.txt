Song:

The girl that I will marry
Will have a heart so wise
That in the hollow of her eye's
My heart will want to tarry
The girl who will be mine
Will have skin so soft and tender
And when it comes December
Her skin will be my wine
And me I'll love her so
And she, she will love me
And our hearts burning slow
For at least a century
Through the window of life
We will go as girl and boy
To become man and wife
To become one with joy
No, it isn't you
The girl that I will marry
No, it isn't you
The girl who'll marry me
The girl that I will love
Will have a house of grace
All painted white, and there my soul
Will find it's hiding place
The girl that I will love
Will do her vigil keeping
And late at night she'll tell me of
The children that are sleeping
And me, I'll love her so
And she, she will love me
We'll make a present of our love
To us and destiny
And we will take the sun
To dress our love in gold
For soon our youth is gone
For soon we must grow old
No, it isn't you
The girl that I will love
No, it isn't you
The girl that will love me
The girl that I will marry
Will age with happiness
For she will have a fireplace
And all my tenderness
The girl that I will marry
Will age without a fear
And like the wine grow mellower
With every passing year
And me, I'll love her so
And she, she will love me
And we will write a song
For all the joys that used to be
And when we leave this earth
Our eyes still filled with love
We'll send a flower down to hell
And up to heaven above
Ah, won't she come to me
The girl that I will marry
Who will she be
The girl who'll marry me
