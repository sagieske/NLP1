Song:

To whom it may concern
Your well-known address
Again, with no answer
To my last request
Disregard ink spots
My presentation
Consider my clear thoughts
My speculations

What a warning

I'm more than worried
The way you're talking
The sky is burning
The clouds are falling
I'm more than sorry

You write me back
Acknowledge my statement
You don't write back

Blank empty words
A creased white receipt
What a disappointment
Was I indiscreet?
Perhaps I'm impolite
Have I the right to write
Am I out of place?
To express my case?

The time is coming
I'm more than worried
The world is dying

The clock is ticking
Real action's missing
I'm more than sorry

Waiting for the mail
I stay well-behaved
Best regards, good world

I stay well-behaved
Best regards, good world
Well into my grave
