Song:

Counting all different ideas drifting away
Past and present -- they don't matter.
Now the future's sorted out
Watch, you're moving in elliptical pattern
Think it's not what you say
What you say is way too complicated
For a minute thought I couldn't tell how to fall out.

It's 20 seconds 'til the last call, you're going "hey hey hey hey hey hey"
Lie down, you know it's easy like we did it all the summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more, you're going "hey hey hey hey hey hey"
It's not a miracle we needed, and no I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, Fold it, Fold it, Fold it

Girlfriend, you know your girlfriend's drifting away
Past and present, 1855-1901
Watch them build up a material tower
Think it's not gonna stay anyway
Think it's overrated
For a minute, thought I couldn't tell how to fall out

It's 20 seconds to the last call, you're going "hey hey hey hey hey hey"
Lie down, you know it's easy, like we did it all the summer long
And I'll be anything you ask and more, you're going "hey hey hey hey hey hey"
It's not a miracle we needed, and no, I wouldn't let you think so
Fold it, Fold it, Fold it, Fold it
Fold it, Fold it, Fold it, Fold it
