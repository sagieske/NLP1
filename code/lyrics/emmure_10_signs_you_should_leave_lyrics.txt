Song:

You know it's all a game.
That we play back and forth.
I leave. You chase.
And were back to square one.
We were not mean to be.
And I tried my best to work it through.
I asked my friends "what should I do?"
Their only advice was leaving you.
But I'm glad I did.
Or at least that's what I tell myself.
I swear to God I never would of known
Your face or your name.
If everyday is a constant reminder you're a:
Whore, liar, ghost, harlet.
And it's sad to say, that
I still cry to the Bayside CD everyday.
Don't you know that those songs are about you?
Check tracks 8 and 9.
Then call me back.
You ask me "when is it over?"
Over? This isn't over till I say it's over.
Back to Square one.
Come On
