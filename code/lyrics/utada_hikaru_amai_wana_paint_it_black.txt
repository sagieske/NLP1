Song:

Everytime we meet in the street by chance
My doubts deepened
That strange guy who appears everywhere I go
Because I'm always doing something dangerous
So no matter what I do, he worries me
Love trap

Being loved and confused
To the point where I couldn't move
Carried along by something that seemed to guard my steps
I was caught

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
A sweet trap, I'm not just calm
I can't be called "shallow," or "young"

Everytime you lose your temper to me
It draws us closer together
Don't make such a suddenly serious face
I was confused by that clever trap of yours
It's a futile resistance
Love trap

Did I underestimate that young smile?
You aimed for the chink in my armor
Because of it's twinkling, your eye
Pushed me into it's depths

Your chains have become comfortable
I'm embraced by both your hands
I want to shine like a firefly

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
I've only beome the prisoner of a sweet trap
Sweet, faint, that gentle light

I was caught in a sweet trap
And my situation has become serious
A sweet trap, you won't say it seriously
Let's confess the whole truth to each other
