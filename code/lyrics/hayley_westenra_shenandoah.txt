Song:

Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away, you rollin' river
O Shenandoah, I long to hear you.
Away I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri.
'Tis seven long years since I last saw you
Away, you rollin' river
'Tis seven long years since I last saw you
Away I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri.

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
Away, you rollin' river.
O Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you,
Away I'm bound to go
'Cross the wide Missouri.
