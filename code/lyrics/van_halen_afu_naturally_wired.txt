(Words by Van Halen)

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

90 days on the road is what I need
When my axe cuts me deep, I let it bleed
On the stage, off my strings, down my face
And all over me. Yeah!

Pumpin' up for the show
Feelin' like somethin's gonna blow

S'got me all fired up
Yes I'm all fired up

Through the ice into the fire
Blowin' steam
North n' South, East n' West, right n' left
I'm always extreme

Don't like the middle squeezin' me
I don't like nothin' in between

Yes, I'm all fired up
Got me all fired up

When the rest have packed it up
I'm alive, I'm electric, inspired

I, I'm naturally wired
Wired! Naturally wired, oh
Wired!

(Guitar Solo)

(Oo-I, I, I, I)
Whoo!
Oh yeah!
Ooh!

I, I, I, I'm naturally wired!
Naturally wired
Wired!
Naturally wired
Wired!
Naturally wired
Wired!
Naturally wired
