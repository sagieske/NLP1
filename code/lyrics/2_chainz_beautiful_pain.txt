Beautiful Pain..

N****s studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the n***a backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
N****s stunt on you, front on you
N****s can't even ball but (??)
I hope you get testicluar cancer in the brain
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her p***y fat but ain't good so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap s**t, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha,
I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
F**k you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now m**********are gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking n***a

[Hook: Lloyd]
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a (??)
Sleeping on the curtains,
What can I say it got me highly motivated
Mama two job working
(??)
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm to young to have burdens
But still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up

You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
(Yeah x2)
Sometime, you don't gotta say much

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Life is a game of inches,
Every move leads to something better,
Theres no time to pay the (b*****s?)
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

[Outro?: 2 Chainz]
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now m**********are gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking n***a
