Song:

If only you could have stayed a little longer
If I had known this feeling
Then I could have been much stronger
And the hurt I feel right now would be so far away
Now all the memories tell me I should have made you stay

You said we'll make it last forever
Maybe you could have been a little stronger too
Now I know that sometimes promises just fade away
I need you here beside me, it's just no good to feel this way

Chorus:
Now that you're gone
I wish you never had to go
Now that you're gone
This pain I feel inside me just goes on and on
Now I know I need you
And I never should have let you go

You said we'll make it last forever
Maybe you could have been a little stronger too
Now I know that sometimes promises just fade away
I need you here beside me, it's just no good to feel this way

Chorus:
Now that you're gone
I wish you never had to go
Now that you're gone
This pain I feel inside me just goes on and on
Now I know I need you
And I never should have let you go

Chorus:
Now that you're gone
I wish you never had to go
Now that you're gone
This pain I feel inside me just goes on and on
Now I know I need you
And I never should have let you go

No, no, no
I never should have let you go
