Song:

Thought that I could bargain barter for your love
But you know it's such a sin, if you play the game of love to win
Play it to win

Tell me where's my rightful place, was it there in your sweet face?
What mamma said to me was true - you are what you love
Not what loves you

Hush now, pretty baby,

Something deep inside of me died when I found out all of your lies
Gotta give myself some kinda meaning, gotta get me some healing
Don't cheat yourself out of love, coz you know that's a bigger sin
To never know such sweetness, never know completeness
But that's where I've been

Hush now, pretty baby

Where's my rightful place, was it there in your sweet face
What mamma said to me was true, you are what you love
Not what loves you
Gotta get me some healing

Hush now, pretty baby
