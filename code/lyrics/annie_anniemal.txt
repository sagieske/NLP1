Song:

(verse)
She's a little girl
In a rich man's world
Everything she'll do
She'll do for you

He's a monster mash
Living on fame and cash
Badly spoiled
A loving dad

(chorus)
Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair (???)
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the animal in you

Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair (???)
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the animal in you

(bridge)
Girl, can't you see?
Come on now, set him free
Try open up his eyes
And make him realize his misery

He do not care
Sittin' over there
Get up, stand up now
Wake up the animal inside of you

(speaking)
I think it should be inside

Animal...
