Song:

Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive
Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bets
Tell me who will make it out alive

Over and over and over again
We play the same old game
Cards kept close to our chest, that's where your secrets kept
So wear your poker face, hands to the fool, hands to the thief
And you can't see

My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand

Cut me up and wear my skin
Show me how to live
Tear me down, clean me up
Now spill my f*****g guts!
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way
Just help me find a way

My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand
My alligator blood is starting to show
I know that you know that, I know that you know
Can't call a bluff with a dead man's hand

Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and, paint the walls

Now you know
Now you know
Now you know

Now you know you can go, you can give up trying
Should've just called it quits
Should've just called it quits
Leave before it's too late
Now you know you can go, you can give up trying
Should've just called it quits
Should've just called it quits
Leave before it's too late

Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bet
Tell me who will make it out alive
Let's play a game of Russian roulette
I'll load the gun, you place the bet
Tell me who will make it out alive

Yeah!

(So put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my f*****g brain)

Put a gun to my head and paint the walls with my brains
Put a gun to my head and paint the f*****g walls
