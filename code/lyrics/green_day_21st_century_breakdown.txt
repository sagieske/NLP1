Song:

Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell.
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled.
The last one born, the first one to run.
My town was blind from refinery sun.

My generation is zero.
I never made it as a working class hero.
21st century breakdown.
I once was lost but never was found.
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline.

I was made of poison and blood.
Condemnation is what I understood.
Videogames of the tower's fall.
Homeland security could kill us all.

My generation is zero.
I never made it as a working class hero.
21st century breakdown.
I once was lost but never was found.
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline.

We are the class of the class of 13'.
Born in the era of humility.
We are the desperate and in the decline.
Raised by the b******s of 1969.

My name is 'no one' the long lost son.
Born on the 4th of July.
Raised in a era of heroes and cons.
That lept me for dead or alife.

I am a nation, a worker, a pawn.
My debt to the status quo.
The scars on my hands are the means to an end.
It's all that I have to show.

I swallowed my pride
And I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers
And lied throught my teeth
The pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
And I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers lept over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Waisting my time
And waiting for judgement day

Praise, Liberty
The freedom to obey
It's a song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line

Oh dream, American dream.
I can't even sleep
From the light's early dawn

Oh scream, America scream.
Believe what you see
From heroes and cons.
