Song:

You were the section of my magazine
You blew my mind like noone of the human kind
You were the only one I could ever speak
This secret language between us and the sheets

You made my mind and body so hot
You sent this wild child into a lady by night
And when I met you long ago I was so alone
My heart was beating so fast I had to write this song
And it goes

You make me feel so beautiful
It's like the sun is always shining when you are in control
You are my Mr. Mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way that you make me feel

Late night lovin' on your balcony
I'm feelin' lovely at the knees who thought that would be me
You lift me up to where I wanna be
You make everything so clear I can finally see

You are the one that I always thinkin' bout
My first love that I made this song about
You know me well and you always make me feel
Like I'm the one and I know your love is real

I love it when you whisper in my ear
You say the sweetest things that I wanted to hear
I never though I could feel this way
And when I leave you in the morning I think of you all day

I feel so peaceful after we make love
I'll lay with you forever just like the sweetest drug
And the whole worlds around us stops and stares
It feels so good to fall asleep knowing that you are there
Come on

You make me feel so beautiful
It's like the sun is always shining when you are in control
You are my Mr. Mystery and
There's no way I can explain the way that you make me feel
And when you left me out this day
I though you will come back anyway
Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?

But that's okay I ain't gonna fall
I gotta get up and roll that's the way you want it
And I won't help it
I'm off to search new love with my chance I might find better
I can make sure you will only bitter
And with the time you don't have to say it
Damn I wonder why I broke up with that fu***n' chick
Now we're wasting all of this time lookin' for girls to hit

You are the one that I always thinkin' bout
My first love that I made this song about
You know me well and you always make me feel
Like I'm the one and I know your love is real

I'm so alone,
I can't get her phone,
I can't call her back and ask her to take me back
Girl: Hello?
Guy: It's, it's me
Girl: Yea so?
Guy: I made a huge mistake
Girl: Uh huh yea you did

Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?,
Ya don't?, ya don't?, ya don't?
Ya don't?
