Song:

Aint no hat 4 that
Yes I say that your behaviour is popostereous
You're just saying imagine if we friend
Dangerous through my pursuit of happiness
Trouble is bout to get me in dealing
You got your good for anxious
You got your good for bad
You wear some shoes and have them, it help now where we stand
It's that aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
No aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
Some say her temperante is a trap for us
She's only nice when something's upstate
And speaking for her friends there is a castuas
We paid the paparazzi, and that we noo
You got your good for anxious
You got your good for bad
You wear some shoes and have them, it help now where we stand
It's that aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
No aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
Shopping for your superficial treasures
Stop shoulder offering you house
Stranger to the simpler things of pleasure
Distance is to you a work of art
You got your good for anxious
You got your good for bad
You wear some shoes and have them, it help now where we stand
It's that aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
No aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
You got your good for anxious
You got your good for bad
You wear some shoes and have them, it help now where we stand
It's that aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
No aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
You got your good for anxious
You got your good for bad
You wear some shoes and have them, it help now where we stand
It's that aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
No aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
Aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
There's aint no hat 4 that, aint no hat 4 that
