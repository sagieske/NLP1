Song:

[Guys]
Oo­, oo­, oo­, oo­, oo­
Oo, oo­, oo, oo
It takes two
Oo. Oo, oo, oo. Oo­, oo
Doo doo, wop!

[Zac]
They say it's a man's world
Well, that cannot be denied
But what good's a man's world
Without a woman by his side
And so I will wait
Until that moment you decide

[Zac & guys]
That I'm your man
And you're my girl
That I'm the sea
And you're the pearl
It takes two, baby,
It takes two

[Zac]
A king ain't a king
Without the power behind the throne
A prince is a pauper. Babe,
Without a chick to call his own
So please, darling, choose me
I don't wanna rule alone
Tell me,

[Zac & guys]
I'm your king
And you're my queen
That no one else
Can come between
It takes two, baby,
It takes two

[Guys]
Don't you know

[Zac]
Lancelot had guinevere
Mrs. Claus has old st. Nick
Romeo had juliet
And liz, well, she has her d**k

They say it takes two to tango
Well, that tango's child's play
So take me to the dance floor
And we'll twist the night away

Just like frankie avalon
Had his favorite mouseketeer
I dream of a lover, babe,
To say the things I long to hear
So come closer baby,
Oh and whisper in my ear

Tell me!

[Zac & guys]
That you're my girl
And I'm your boy
That you're my pride
And I'm your joy
That I'm the sand
And you're the tide
I'll be the groom
If you'll be my bride
It takes two, baby,
It takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes twoooooooo ohhhhooohhhhhhhhh
