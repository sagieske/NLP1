Song:

Ooooohhhh! Yahhh!
If ever you wondered
If you touched my soul, yes you do
Since I met you I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do
Just the way you say hello
With one touched I can't let go
Never thought I've fall in love with you.

Because of you my life has changed thank you for the love and the joy you've bring
Because of you I feel no shame I tell the world it's because of you.

Sometimes I get lonely
And all I gotta do is to think of you
You captured something inside of me you make all of my dreams come true it's not enough that you love me for me you reached inside and touched me eternally
I love you best explains how I feel for you

Because of you my life has changed thank you for the love and the joy you've bring
Because of you I fell no shame I tell the world it's because of you.

The magic in your eyes true love I can't deny if you hold me I just lose control I want you to know that I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me I want the world to see it's because of you...

Because of you my life has changed thank you for the love and the joy you've bring
Because of you I feel no shame I tell the world it's because of you.
