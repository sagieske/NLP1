Song:

I guess it was wishful to think
I was different from the rest
Now I'm red in the face
I don't think I'm impressed

Miss strong and outspoken
So easily broken

Now I kick myself
I should've know better
Get it together

You can't blame me

Are you listening?

Wrap your lines
Around another

While you sweet talk to yourself
I'd rather leave

You stitched a heart on your sleeve
But I see right through the seams

I knew the coward in you
Would play the lead

The nights you spent with me
And didn't want to leave
You stayed with me until I fell asleep

All the things I wish I said
Playing back inside my head

It just might be a long shot
You're marching with your eyes shut

Wrap your lines
Around another

While you sweet talk to yourself
I'd rather leave

You stitched a heart on your sleeve
But I see right through the seams

I knew the coward in you
Would play the lead

All the things I wish I said
Playing back inside my head

It just might be a long shot
You're marching with your eyes shut

Wrap your lines
Around another

While you sweet talk to yourself
I'd rather leave

You've stitched a heart on your sleeve
But I see right through the seams

I knew the coward in you
Would play the lead
