Hi! The Ohio players would like to wish you the happiest of holidays...

Snowflakes falling; voices calling
Coming out of happy new year
Children singing; Santa's bringing...
Santa's bringing lots of cheer

Kin folks coming from out of town
And grandpa's stomach is so big and round
Aw, there's really just one thing we wanna say:
Happy Holidays!
Happy Holiday!
O ho ho ho!
Happy Holidays. Happy Holidays!
Happy Holiday, girl. Huh!
Happy Holidays. Happy Holidays!
Hahaha

Kin folks coming from everywhere
But you know one thing
This time of the year I don't even care
There's just one thing that I'm really trying to say and that's a
Happy Holidays!

Deck the halls for Santa Claus...
I wanna stand under the miseltoe
I can't wait till new year's day...
My resolution will be to love you more
This is a time for brotherhood
Peace on earth is well understood
Brotherly love is the only good
Happy Holidays...

Chestnuts roasting; people toasting...
Bringing in the New Year. Oh dear!
Stars so bright on silent night...
They came to see the king from far and near
If we all love like I know we should
The world would be filled with so much good
We all live in the same neighborhood
Happy Holidays...
The Ohio players wanna wish you a very happy holidays
Happy holidays...
Happy holidays...
