Song:

You built the windows high.
And said it would last forever.
You stare all night at the empty sky.
To keep his thoughts together.
To see the angel once again.
She came to him back when,
His life was full of promise.
And he swore that he had all he needed then.
Swore it would last forever.
To see the angel once again.
To see the angel once again.
He wouldn't let her go.
He thought it would last forever.
She said that his love was a dead mans love,
Draining the life from another.
To see the angel once again.
To see the angel once again.
To see the angel once again.
And if you're gonna live your life like that,
Its gonna let you down.
If you're gonna live your life like that,
Its gonna let you down.
If you're gonna live your life like that,
Its gonna let you down.
If you're gonna live your life like that,
Its gonna let you down.
You wont see the angel again.
See the angel once again.
