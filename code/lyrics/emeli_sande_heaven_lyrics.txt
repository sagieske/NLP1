Song:

Will you recognize me
In the flashing light?
I try to keep my heart beat
But I can't get it right

Will you recognize me
When I'm lying on my back?
Something's gone inside me
And I can't get it back

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wake with good intentions
But the day it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone
Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wake with good intentions
But the day it always lasts too long

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
[X2]

Will you recognize me
When I'm stealing from the poor?
You're not going to like me, 
I'm nothing like before
Will you recognize me
When I lose another friend?
Will you learn to leave me?
Or give me one more try again?

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wake with good intentions
But the day it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone
Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wake with good intentions
But the day it always lasts too long

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
[X2]

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wake with good intentions
[X3]

You say that you're away
I try but always break
'Cause the day always lasts too long

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone
[X2]
