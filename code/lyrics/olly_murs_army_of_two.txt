Song:

Yeah! Ah!

I came. I saw.
Tore down these walls.
Blocked one way. I found another.
You know you’ll always be discovered. If it's me, You choose. I can’t lose.
I’m in love with you if you love me too.

Yeah!

Don’t ever change and I’ll stay the same.
We’ll be swimming in the same direction.
We’ll never lose this connection.
Nothing they can do to stop this army of two.
We’re marching to the future, yeah it’s me and you.

Soldiers, follow my lead. Repeat after me.
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun.
Love is all we need.
Now our fear’s on the run, we’ve already won.
Now march with the band and raise your right hand.
We’ve only just begun.

I took a vow to never let you down.
When it’s us there ain’t no competition.
I could be the star, on which you’re wishing.
I never doubted for a moment, it’s true.
I love all of you, if you love me too.

Yeah!

Don’t ever change and I’ll stay the same.
We’ll be swimming in the same direction.
We’ll never lose this connection.
Nothing they can do to stop this army of two.
We’re marching to the future, yeah it’s me and you.

Soldiers, follow my lead. Repeat after me.
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun.
Love is all we need.
Now our fear’s on the run, we’ve already won.
Now march with the band and raise your right hand.
We’ve only just begun.

Only just begun. Only just begun. Only just begun.

So don’t ever change and I’ll stay the same.
We’ll be swimming in the same direction.
We’ll never lose this connection.
Nothing they can do to stop this army of two.
Cos we’re marching to the future, yeah it’s me and!

Soldiers, follow my lead. Repeat after me.
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun.
Love is all we need.
Now our fear’s on the run, we’ve already won.
Now march with the band and raise your right hand.
We’ve only just begun.

It’s the moment of truth.
I'm counting on you, this army of two.
I’ve only just begun.
It’s the moment of truth.
I’m counting on you, this army of two.
I’ve only just begun.
