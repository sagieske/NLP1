Song:

I never thought that one day you
Would become a part of my life
Still you were always with me
When I lay my head down at night
Could you really be here with me
Has my wish come true tonight

Chorus:
Cause now, now it seems I'm wide awake in this dream
And I'd do, I'd do anything to stay here forever oh oh
Yeah and if this is a dream I'm not gonna wake up (but)
But if I'm awake, I won't cloe my eyes again.

Though I feel like I'm flying
I'm sure my feet are still on the ground
Open my eyes and it's amazing
How my world is changed when I look around
It's like I've foound the road straight to heaven
And that road has lead me right here to you oh oh oh

Chorus:
Cause now, now it seems I'm wide awake in this dream
And I do, I do anything to stay here forever oh oh
Yeah and if this is a dream I'm not gonna wake up (but)
But if I'm awake, I wont close my eyes again

Everything I'll ever need
Is standing right in front of me
You've given more than I could ever ask of you
Now all I can do is give forever to you

Chorus:
Cause now now it seems I'm wide awake in this dream

Cause now now it seems I'm wide awake in this dream
And I'd do I'd do anything to stay here forever oh oh
Yeah and if this is a dream I'm not gonna wake up(but)
But if I'm awake I wont close my eyes again.
