Song:

Dear prudence
Won't you come
Out to play?
Dear prudence
Greet
The brand new day
The sun is up
The sky is blue
It's beautiful
And so are you
Dear prudence
Won't you come
Out to play?

Dear prudence
Open up your eyes
Dear prudence
See the sunny skies
The wind is low
The birds will sing
That you are part
Of everything
Dear prudence
Won't you open up
Your eyes?

Look around round
Look around
Round round
Look around

Dear prudence
Let me
See you smile
Dear prudence
Like
A little child
The clouds
Will be
A daisy chain
So let me see you
Smile again
Dear prudence
Won't you let me
See you smile?

Dear prudence
Won't you come
Out to play?
Dear prudence
Greet
The brand new day
The sun is up
The sky is blue
It's beautiful
And so are you
Dear prudence
Won't you come
Out to play?
