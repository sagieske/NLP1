Song:

Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well, I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well, not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

Wherever you go
Well, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well, I'm more than willing

Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

I've never been with anyone
In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed
Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall

I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no the danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind
