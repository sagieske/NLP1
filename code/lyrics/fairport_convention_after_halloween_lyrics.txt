Song:

(Sandy Denny)
Red and gold and Halloween have passed us by
The charcoal branches lean against the rosy sky
You are so far away and I could touch you if I may
But don't you worry now, I'm only dreaming anyway
You may be lonely, you may be just on your own
It could be anywhere, some place that I have know
But who am I and do we really live these days at all
And are they simply feelings we have learnt and do recall
Oh, the sea has made me cry
But I love her too, so maybe I love you
Tears are only made of salt and water
And across the waves the sound of laughter
October has gone and left me with a song
That I will sing to you although the moment may be wrong
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway
