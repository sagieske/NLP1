Song:

Darling, gimme head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shining, gleaming, steaming, sides and waxen
Give me down to there hair, shoulder length or longer
Here baby, there mama, everywhere daddy, daddy
Hair (Go, go, go, go, go little girls)
Flow it, show it
Long as god can grow it, my hair
Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas, a hive for bees and a nest for birds
There ain't no words for the beauty, the splendor, the wonder of my hair (Go, go, go, go, go little girls)
Flow it, show it
Long as god can grow it, my hair

I want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy, snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty, oily, greasy, fleecy, shining, gleaming, streaming, flaxen, waxen, knotted, polka-dotted, twisted, beaded, braided, powdered, flowered and confettied, bangled, tangled, spangled and spaghettied

They'll be ga ga at the go go when they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond brilliantined, biblical hair
My hair like jesus wore it
Hallelujah, I adore it
Hallelujah, mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair (Go, go, go, go, go little girls)
Flow it, show it
Long as god can grow it, my hair (Go, go, go, go, go little girls)
Flow it, show it
Long as god can grow it, my hair (Go, go, go, go, go little girls)
Flow it, show it
Long as god can grow it, my hair
