Song:

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
It's not warm when he's away
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away

I wonder this time where he's gone
I wonder how long he's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

But ain't no sunshine when he's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know when he's gone
He's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Anytime he goes away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
