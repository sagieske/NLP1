Song:

Wassup, yo? Heard them all now I'm singing for the biggest jewel... Boys and girls
S**... Right now... Sing
... Know I was at

I run I jump I fly on me on you on we on mine
Your love it takes me high, so real, so true, I can't lie
Oh boy you got me going crazy, baby
I think I want to have your baby
Stop playing... Bahm bahm

Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe, when you come around make me get weak and...
Boy stay oh please, don't leave I need you by my side and I'm begging you please
I think your loving is amazing, bahm bahm
Oh boy you're hot you're really blazing
When you're... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Boy want to give me,... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again, bahm

Know in your heart I try to do everything you want, do everything you like, bahm
I need you to be mine, if I can't you I think I'm gonna cry, bahm
You never take me not one word, now put your loving is a problem
Call the police
Call 911 I'm hooked, I'm shocked up, fallen and I can't get up, bahm
Your lips, your body, your touch, got me in a trance I can't get enough, bahm
You're too much for me and I can't take it, bahm bahm
Oh boy, you got my body shaking

When you're... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again,
When you're... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again,

I said you're the boy I want, I don't want another one
Baby baby you're s*** come undress me, oh boy, cause you turn me on
I say you're the one I want, I don't want another one
Baby you're s*** come undress me, oh boy, cause you turn me on

When you're... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again,
When you're... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again,
... Up on me, love up on me, touch up on me
Do it once again,

Put down... And you don't know... Like said before
So what is done said... Said what?

Tell me pretty baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
Tell me baby baby if you wanna make love tonight
I want you... But never get on, and baby boy I want you
Turning me on, and never go, and baby boy I want you
Baby boy I want your love
