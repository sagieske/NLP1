Song:

This snowman is shaping up to be an eight
But not out of ten
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when
They break though these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time
Now the girls up the street are innocent and sweet
While their all in bed
They got their makeup and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
Soon they will change
But tonite hollywood hills never seem so strange
Their mothers pray it will last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled
I wanna wish you merry christmas
Ho ho ho

Now the boys are all grown up
And there working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
I've been raking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up
I pray to god it don't last a long time

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night
Will bring

I wanna roll around like a kid in the snow
I wanna relearn what I already know
Just let me take flight dressed in red
Through the night on a great big sled

I wanna wish you merry christmas
Can't do that
I wanna wish you merry christmas
Can't do that
