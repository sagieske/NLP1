Song:

Whatґs wrong, my pet?
You seem so upset
Tell me whatґs bothering you
Youґre acting strange
Itґs time for a change
Let me suggest what to do:

Letґs cuddle up
In my security blanket
And there we can hide
From the world
Why should we care
If others conform?

Weґll snuggle up
So cozy and warm

Oh, we will be safe
When weґre wrapped up
In the blanket
Weґll see all our problems
Unfurl
So letґs cuddle up
In my security blanket
And there we can hide
From the world
