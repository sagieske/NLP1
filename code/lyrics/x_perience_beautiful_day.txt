Song:

Its years since you've been leaving
the places we were born
I wake up I am receiving
a sign of your return

You gave me one good reason
to wait until you come
I'm waiting and I'm dreaming
were drowning in the sun

A beautiful day and a beautiful night
you drive me crazy when you hold me tight

I live my life so slow and
i'll walk while you will run
I slam the door behind me
the same way as you've done

The flowers you've planted
are growing in the light
they're waiting in the backyard
I visit every night
