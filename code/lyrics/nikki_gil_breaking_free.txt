Song:

[Vince]
Hmhmhm...

We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach!

[Nikki]
If we're tryin' so we're breakin' free

[Alicia]
You know the world can see us,
In a way that's different than who we are!

[Nikki]
Creating space between us, till we sep'rate hearts...

[All]
But your faith it gives me strength,
Strength to believe...

[Vince]
We're breakin' free!

[Alicia]
We're soarin'

[Nikki]
Flyin'

[Nikki and Alicia]
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...

[Vince]
If we're tryin'

[Nikki and Alicia]
Yeah we're breakin' free...

[Vince]
Yeah were breakin' free

[Alicia]
Can you feel it building... ?
Like a wave the ocean just can't control...

[Nikki]
Connected by a feelin',
Ohh... With our very soul...

[Alicia]
Our very soul...

[All]
Rising 'till it lifts us up,
So ev'ryone can see...

[Vince]
We're breakin' free!

[Nikki]
We're soarin'

[Alicia and Vince]
Flyin!

[All]
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...

[Vince]
If we're tryin...

[Nikki and Alicia]
Yeah we're breakin' free

[Vince]
Yeah we're breakin' free!

[Alicia]
Ohohoh... Runnin'

[Nikki]
Climbin'...

[Nikki and Alicia]
To get to that place to be all that we can be... !

[Vince]
Now's the ti-ime!

[Alicia and Vince]
So we're breakin' free...

[Nikki]
Yeah we're breakin' free!

[Vince]
More than hope,
More than faith...

[Nikki]
This is true,
This is fate...
And together

[All]
We see it comin'

[Vince]
More than you,
More than me...

[Alicia]
Not a want,
But a need...
Both of us

[All]
Breakin free...

[Nikki]
We're soarin'

[Vince]
Flyin...

[All]
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...

[Vince]
If we're tryin'

[Nikki and Alicia]
Yeah we're breakin' free

[Vince]
Yeah we're breakin' free!

[Alicia]
Ohohoh... We're runnin

[Vince]
Climbin...

[Alicia]
To get to that place to be all what we can be...
Now'a the time...

[Vince]
Now's the time

[All]
Yeah we're breakin' free!

[Vince]
You know the world

[All]
Can see us...

[Vince]
In a way that's

[All]
Different than who we are...
