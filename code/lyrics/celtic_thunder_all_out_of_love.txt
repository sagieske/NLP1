Song:

I'm lying alone
With my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too
But what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times in my life feel so low
It would make me believe that tomorrow could bring
What today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm so out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonley nights
I'm reachin for you
Hope you feeling it too
Does the feeling feel oh so right?

What would you say if I call on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I known you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong

Mmm what are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was so wrong

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believeing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be to lat to say I was so wrong!
