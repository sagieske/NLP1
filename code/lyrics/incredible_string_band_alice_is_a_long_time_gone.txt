Song:

White rabbit smile, white rabbit smile
Cry not so loud my lover frowns
I'm a grown up lady from London town
Yet ever more he sang his sad song-
Sweet Alice is a long time gone

Oh Alice is gone, gone
Alice is gone, gone
Sweet Alice is a long time gone

She was pretty, oh yes
With her flaxen hair, her eyes so fair
Her sweet voice and her snow white dress

Oh Alice is gone, gone
Alice is gone, gone
Sweet Alice is a long time gone

It's seven long years
Since last I seen your face
No-one in Wonderland
Could take your place
But when I see you again
That sets me back apace
Sweet Alice is a long time gone

I would exchange my coat of fur
If time would turn or waters burn
I'd wish you back the way you were

Oh Alice is gone, gone
Alice is gone, gone
Sweet Alice is a long time gone.
