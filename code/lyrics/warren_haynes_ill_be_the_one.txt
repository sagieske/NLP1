Song:

When you're walking down the street
I'll be the one that stares like a statue
You turn the corner
I'll be the one that follows you downtown
When you finally notice me
I'll be the one fumbling with his feelings
Totally oblivious to anything and everything else
Around

Girl, when we met
I'll be the one that showers you with attention
To win your love
I'll fight until the very end
When you treat me like a fool
I'll be the one that doesn't need redemption
Yeah, drive me away
I'll keep coming back again and again

I'll be the rain if you want me to be
Help you to groa with no guarantee
Even be the clown sad but true
But don't use me up
Or I'll be the one that used to worship you

When silence fills your world
I'll be the one that knows what you're thinking
And when passion burns like fire
I'll be the one bathing in the light
When the curse of darkness falls
I'll be the one who offers a candle
I'll even be the cushion
For things that go crazy in the night

I'll be the rain if you want me to be
Help you to groa with no guarantee
Even be the clown sad but true
But don't use me up
Or I'll be the one that used to worship you

I'll be the rain if you want me to be
Help you to groa with no guarantee
Even be the clown sad but true
But don't use me up
Or I'll be the one that used to worship you
