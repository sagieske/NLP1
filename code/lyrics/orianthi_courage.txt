Song:

Take all my vicious words
And turn them into something good
Take all my preconceptions
And let the truth be understood
Take all my prized possessions
Leave only what I need
Take all my pieces of doubt
And let me be what's underneath
Courage is when you're afraid, 
But you keep on moving anyway
Courage is when you're in pain, 
But you keep on living anyway
We all have excuses why
Living in fear something in us dies
Like a bird with broken wings
It's not how high he flies, 
But the song he sings
Courage is when you're afraid, 
But you keep on moving anyway
Courage is when you're in pain, 
But you keep on living anyway
It's not how many times you've been
Knocked down
It's how many times you get back up
Courage is when you've lost your way, 
But you find your strength anyway
Courage is when you're afraid
Courage is when it all seems grey
Courage is when you make a change, 
And you keep on living anyway
You keep on moving anyway
You keep on giving anyway
You keep on loving anyway
