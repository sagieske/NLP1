Song:

Please you have to help me
This is not my true face
If you could see my soul
As I have seen my soul
I could show it to you
It's rotten
It's poison
Help me please

Please, give me a f*****g excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret, regret

Are you with me or are you on your own
It's time to choose your side
So choose your side

Are you with me or are you on your own
It's time to choose your side
So choose your f*****g side

Could be the end of the world
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away (x2)

Hear me now
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a god you'll ever know
Get off your knees

Open your eyes
I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you
I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

Could be the end of the world
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away (x2)

Over and over
Over and over
Fuckin hell
F**k
