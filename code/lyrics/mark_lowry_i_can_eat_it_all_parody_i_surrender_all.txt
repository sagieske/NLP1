Song:

I can scarf a dozen dougnuts,
And lick the suger off my hands,
If I had a hundred tacos,
I could eat 'em on demand.

If I eat 'em even faster,
You can see my waist expand,
But the bloated feeling that I get,
Is the part that I can't stand

I'm the middle of the kitchen,
I can't help but gain a pound,
I'll never taste the feel of victory
Till I finally chow down

I can offer no defence,
When that aroma fills the place,
When I'm served a tray of burgers,
I will gladly stuff my face,

I can eat it all,
Alfalfa, sprouts, and grains,
But when it comes to fast food,
I eat everything,
I can eat it all,
Whatever I desire,
It's fat that I require,
Cause I'm a butterball,
I can eat it all.

The source of my condition,
Is the fact I don't obstain,
I can measure my consumption,
By the weight that I have gained

Though my friends call me a glutty,
And that causes me such pain,
If they serve me one more salad,
I think I will go insane

Cause I've laid aside the health food,
For the fatter foods I've found,
When I get my hands on pizza,
I can never put it down

When I hit my favorite restraunts,
I eat everything I see,
After hours at the buffet,
They are begging me to leave

I can eat it all,
Alfalfa sprouts and grains,
But when it comes to fast food,
I eat everything,
I can eat it all,
Whatever I desire,
It's fat that I require,
Cause I'm a butterball,
I can eat it all

I have a favorite verse,
I would like you all to know,
And it goes like this,
"Man cannot live by bread alone"

That is why I lay my ground beef,
On a golden flame of fire,
The more I have,
The more that I desire

I can eat it all

(small break)

I can eat it all,
Whatever I desire
It's fat that I require
Cause I'm a butterball
I'm wider then I'm tall
I'm pure cholesteral,
I can eat it all
