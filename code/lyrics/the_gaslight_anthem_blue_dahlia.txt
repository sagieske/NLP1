Song:

What a hot and sultry summer,
The steam just slides up off them streets
You got to stay inside and wait for the night,
And then come on over and see me
There's a poetry about these streets,
It just slips from your skin and goes right underneath
And mama always knew I'd meet a girl like you,
But me, I never believed

Cuz I've been so lonely I can't imagine that kind of sympathy [x2]

Where'd you get them scars?
How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break?
She said, "it's sad enough to break"
How long was your life?
Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, "I'm man enough my baby, come see about me"

I had a dream about you once, and I could barely see your form
And I met you between the wax and the needle,
In the words of my favorite song
Your black hair was like a raven with your tan skin on the beach
Your backdrop were the auroras and my sidekick was all this grief
I've been so low down, I'm almost level with the ground

Where'd you get them scars?
How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break?
She said "it's sad enough to break"
How long was your life?
Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, "I'm man enough my baby, come see about me"

Did they take you to the carnival to get locked up on a ride?
Me, I got caught up with the fortuen tellers
And the ladies with the sleepy eyes
It took years my baby just to come clean,
Every streetlight a reminder
And all those apologies
And the night was lonely next to me
Even the night was lonely next to me

Where'd you get them scars?
How blue is your heart?
Is it sad enough to break?
She said "it's sad enough to break"
How long was your life?
Was it cold and strange like mine?
Are you man enough to lay here?
She said, "I'm man enough my baby, come see about me"
Come see about me, ah-ah
Come see about me,
Come see about me,
Come see about me, ah-ah
Come see about me, ah-ah
Whenever you're lonely
