Song:

(Tex Logan)

Holly's in the window,
Home is where the wind blows.
I can't walk for runnin'! --
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.

Can't you hear them bells ringin', ringin'
Joy, joy! Hear them singin'!
When it's snowin', I'll be goin'
Back to my country home.

Christmas Time's A-Comin',
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.
And I know I'm goin' home.

Bright candles burnin',
My old heart's a-yearnin'
For the folks at home when
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.

Snow flakes a-fallin'
My old heart's a-callin'
Tall pine's a-hummin'
Christmas Time's A-Comin'.
