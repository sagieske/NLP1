[Chorus:]
Well alright, okay, you win
I'm in love with you
Well alright, okay, you win
Baby what can I do?

I'll do anything you say
It's just got to be that way

[Repeat chorus]

Anything you say I'll do
As long as it's me and you
All that I am askin'
All I want from you
Just love me like I love you
And it won't be hard to do

[Repeat chorus]

I'll do anything you say
It's just got to be that way

All that I am askin'
All I want from you
Just love me like I love you
And it won't be hard to do

[Verse 4]
Well alright, okay, you win
I'm in love with you
Well alright, okay, you win
Baby one thing more
If you're gonna be my man
Sweet baby take me by the hand

[Repeat verse 4]

Well alright, okay, you win
