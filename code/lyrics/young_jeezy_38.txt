Song:

[Chorus:]
I don't think they know the time (x5)
Heard the streets f-cked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that s**t got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

[Young jeezy – verse 1]
Ooh oh, your boy back
And he way to flashy, got my toys back
N***a I just left the lot, I aint come to play
He pull me from my dealer tag, f-ck you trying to say
Know some n****s doing 10, blame it on the yay
Clip hold half a hundred, blame it on the k
Still the realest n***a any, these n****s cb4
This is f-ck a n***a records, and I'm the ceo
Got them stack long and wide, like some lego blocks
Say you need a real home, this my lego spot
You ever seen so much money in a duffle bag?
Soon as you open up the ship, the b***h will double brag

[Chorus:]
I don't think they know the time
Heard the streets f-cked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that s**t got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire

[Young jeezy – verse 2]
I'm in that purple lam', looking like some dirty sprite
Catch them b******s with them birds, yeah that rowdy white
Where I'm from them things hot, and that talk is cheap
And aint nobody hearing s**t, cause they trying to eat
All they can eat, buffet style
N***a selling anything, buffet wild
Db9 stupid grill, yeah that overbite
Need me 9 stupid deals, this s**t is overpriced
Got it vacuum sealed up, that's the hide the scent
So much that if they pull you over, smell it through the vent
If them people hit them lights, I be a nervous wreck
When you don't fear nothing but the lights, now that's a nervous check

[Chorus:]
I don't think they know the time (x5)
Heard the streets f-cked up, I can see the sign
Heard they going for the 30 straight
I can't lie, man that s**t got me 38
Red hot, on fire
Glass pot, on fire
Red dot, on fire
5 shots, on fire
