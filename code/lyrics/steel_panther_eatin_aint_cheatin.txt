Song:

I went down on her last night
From what I understand baby that's alright
I didn't screw her and that's the truth but I eat that vagina through and through
She rocked my stick and I blew my load
But right after, honey, I came home
I love you better than all the rest but eating out weekly I can't resist
So if you want to come with me, I'll show you what I mean

Eatin ain't cheatin
I don't know what your talking about
Eatin ain't cheatin
You should know that sucking ain't fucking
Eatin ain't cheatin

Now I'm just a man in a band
I'm eatin out the bitches as fast as I can
Licky clitty clitty
Tonging that twat
It's finger licking good
Baby why should I stop
If you want to have a seat I'll clear a place on my face yeah

Eatin ain't cheatin
I'm backstage only using my mouth
Eatin ain't cheatin
Baby munchings jusy lunching yeah

Uhhhhh (licking sound)
Ummmm Yeah

Now Licky! 

(Guitar Solo)

It doesn't make me unfaith unless I'm laying down the cable (cable cable)

Ahahahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 

Eatin ain't cheatin
You should know sucking ain't fucking
Eating ain't cheatin
I'm telling all the girls around the world

Eatin
Eatin ain't cheatin

Eatin
Eatin ain't cheatin
