Slim Thug:

Mjg:
"Some of our mothers and fathers are gone, Our sisters and brothers are gone,
Our babies and children are gone, But, Life. Goes. On. And so you gotta be strong, Because hard times do not discriminate, They only intimidate, bully and eliminate people without any faith, And if it wasn't for the pitfalls in my life, I never ever would have learned how to climb out, Some things you can't be told or taught, some things you just gotta find out, Some people go from millions to nothing, Some people go from nothing to mills, But what both of them got in common, neither one of them is happy still, You can be a preacher or pack the steal, or whatever your tactics is, So many people out here so fake, they need to take a break and practice real, Pimp tight M J, tryin to live life, and trying to live good, I played my part but I didn't write the book.
