Song:

The serpent knows,
When the curtain falls,
With denials blindfold,
He greets another day

[Chorus:]
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie,
A perfect ten,
When reality caves in
Don't tell me,
Tell my ghost,
'cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know
I found secrets about life's undertow

Life's wrapped in a riddle,
Easier said than done,
Way to play the victim,
Just run and hide.

[Chorus:]

Let them take me far away

Crawl back in place,
It's easier to cope behind the curtain,
Wipe the worries away
No thought about the consequence

[Chorus:]

Let them take me far away
