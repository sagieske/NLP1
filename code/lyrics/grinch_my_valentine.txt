Song:

Still can't remember
How it started
I know the fire burned till dawn
Innuendoes
Accusations
Feelings denied too long
Can't ever wash away
The memory
Of the way she looked at me
A million poisons
Seems like a million years
But the stains never come clean
I'll never shake those
Echoes of
The words that numbed my soul
We spoke of lies and ugly truth
Until I finally lost control
I raised my fist
She said
"You wouldn't dare"
So I showed her she was wrong
That's when I saw
The face of true love
She said, "Ooh babe this really turns me on...
Won't you-
Be my Valentine
Be my Valentine
Be my Valentine
Be my Valentine
This one last time"
