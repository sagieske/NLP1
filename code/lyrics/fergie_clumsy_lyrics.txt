Can't help it
Girl can't help it (oh babe)

First time, that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me, mmm mmmm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mmm mmm

[Chorus:]
You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh)
Flippin' (oh), fumblin' (so)
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh)
Sinkin' (oh), crumblin' (so)
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
So in love with you

Can't breathe, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, mmm mmmm
Whoa now? Think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me
Mmm mmm

[Chorus:]
You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin'
(Oh), flippin'(Oh), fumblin' (so)

[Bridge (talking):]
You know this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This love sick thing
I like serious relationships and uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone, but
The love bug crawls right back up and bites me
And I'm back

[B-Section:]
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (in in love)
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (oh god)
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (I'm back in love)
Can't help it
Whooo hoo hoo
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah)
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah baby)
Can't help it
Girl can't help it (I'm back in love, yeah)
Can't help it (I know you got me)

[Chorus:]
You got me trippin' (oh), stumblin' (oh)
Flippin' (oh), fumblin' (so)
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh)
Sinkin' (oh), crumblin' (so)
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
So in love with you

Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
You got me slippin' (oh), tumblin' (oh)
Sinkin' (oh), crumblin' (so)
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (in in love)
So in love with you
So in love with you
So in love with you
