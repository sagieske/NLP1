Song:

I said congralutaions and I hope you're happy
But I was lying I hope you're crying
And everytime she touches you you'll think of me.

I said the best of luck to you to your new love
But I was lying no use denying
I'm not as good a loser as I thought I'd be.

I hope our past is strong enough to cloud your vision
Till one day he'll even get to look like me
I hope my mem'ry crowd your mind within decision
And from force of habit you'll run straight to me.

And when I said I'll see you soon let's get together
I wasn't lying I hope you're crying
Tears of joy the day that you come back to me...
