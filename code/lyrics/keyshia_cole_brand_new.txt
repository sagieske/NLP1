Song:

I want you to, wrap your hands around my body
Take me to another place let's get away from here
I want you to, let me know exactly how you feel
No holding back, no strings attached
Wanna touch your body

Chorus:
Let me show you something brand new
When we're through, we'll talk
All night, what's on your mind
Let me show you something brand new
When we're through, we'll talk
All night, what's on your mind

Hook:
(Tell me what's on your mind)
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?
(Talk to me baby) What's on your mind?
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?
Yeah... (I need your love)

No one can make me make me feel this way
Way when you touch me touch my soul
And make me lose control
I wanna feel everything you give to me
(I need your love)
Take my heart (Take my heart)
Take my body (Take my body)
Take my love (Take my love)
But give me all you got
I don't wanna stop lovin you
Make me over baby don't go

Chorus:
Let me show you something brand new
When we're through, we'll talk
All night, what's on your mind
Let me show you something brand new
When we're through, we'll talk
All night, what's on your mind
