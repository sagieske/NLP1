Song:

Sun, that's how I call her
'Cause we met in summerland
Sun, that's why I loved her
'Cause I came from the night

Sun made me tender
Covered my life
In the way
That I needed so bad

Just a sun
In the horizon
With a strange
Shiny look in her eyes

Sun, she's like a fountain
Where I dream and make love
And the light over her shoulders
Makes me think nothing is real

Sun made me tender
Covered my life
In the way
That I needed so bad

But one day
Sun changed direction
And she left me
Alone in the shade.
