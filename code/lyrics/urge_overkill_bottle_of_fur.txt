Song:

You can't be too sure.

Sail away on a crystal ship in a bottle
Gonna say goodbye to all my friends on shore
Maybe she's giving me a second chance
You can't be too sure

Like a bottle of fur
Missing the smell of her
Bottle of fur
Missing the smell of her
Bottle of Fur
Bottle of Fur yeah

If I was a king and you'd dance for me like a genie
Then you'd get back in your lamp leaving me here with the gold
Ooh bread of wickedness both sides buttered with war
But your load ship brings goodbye to love and loss any more
No more

Maybe she's giving me a second chance
Maybe she's giving me a second chance
You can't be too sure
You can't be too sure
You can't be too sure
You can't be too sure
You can't be too sure
You can't be too sure

Like a bottle of fur
Missing the smell of her
I'm missing the smell of her
Like when I'd hold you in the night
We used to make it til daylight
Now I sleep alone
Now I sleep alone

Like a bottle of fur
Missing the smell of her
Bottle of fur
Missing the smell of her
Bottle of Fur
Bottle of Fur yeah
