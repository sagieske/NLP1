Song:

There's a building program going on in Heaven
Construction carried out by God's own hand
Fifteen hundred miles wide
Mansions standing side by side
The streets are paved with gold throughout the land
Now they say they'll be no dying in that city
No sickness and no sorrow will be known
The feeble will be young
No division all is one
Eternal celebrating going on
Chorus
Don't you wanna go with me to God's new city
Don't you wanna hear that heavenly choir sing
Don't you wanna touch the nail scarred hands that brought this great salvation plan
Can't you feel it stirrin' in your soul
Don't you wanna go
You know I have many loved ones waiting over yonder
And how I long to see my precious father there
All the saints will gather in
Immortal bodies free from sin
As we praise the Lamb of God who's joy we'll share
