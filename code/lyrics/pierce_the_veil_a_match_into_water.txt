Song:

Let's Go!
I kissed the scars on her skin,
I still think you're beautiful
And I don't ever want to lose my best friend.
I screamed out "God you vulture,
Bring her back or take me with her! "

Tear it down,
Break the barricade.
I wanna see what sound it makes,
I hate this flavor with a passion and I f*****g hate the aftertaste!

How does it feel
(How does it feel?)
How does it feel well it feels like I'm on fire!
Wake up I know you can hear me!

Make me a promise here tonight,
Love like a tidal wave.
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way.
The chemicals will bring you home again.
This is it, when it's done we can say that,
When it's sudden death we fight back.

Oh yeah, pretend like I don't entice you,
I've seen you circling the sky above my head,
You traitor!

I will never be taken for granted again,
Keep digging holes in the desert!
Say a prayer for you,
I know that you're in pain, but if we die at the same time does it still scare you?

Make me a promise here tonight (Let's go!),
Love like a tidal wave.
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way.
The chemicals will bring you home again,
This is it, when it's done we can say that,
Oh my God, we're not gonna make it!

We will bring the tidal wave,
We will bring the tidal wave,
We will bring the tidal wave,
We will bring the tidal wave!

We will bring the tidal wave!
We will bring the tidal wave!
We will bring the tidal wave!
And nothing will remain!

She's mine!
You stay away from her, it's not her time!
'Cause baby I'm the one who haunts her dreams at night,
Until she's satisfied.

Make me a promise here tonight,
Love like a tidal wave.
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way.
The chemicals will bring you home again,
This is it, when it's done we can say that,
When it's sudden death we fight back!

Go!

F**k it!
