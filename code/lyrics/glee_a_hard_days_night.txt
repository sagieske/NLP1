Song:

[Rachel:]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

[Rachel with Santana:]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone

[Rachel:]
You know I feel okay

When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

[Santana with Rachel:]
It's been a hard day's night

[Santana:]
And I've been working like a dog

[Santana with Rachel:]
It's been a hard day's night

[Santana:]
I should be sleeping like a log

[Rachel with Santana:]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do

[Rachel:]
Will make me feel all right, ooww!

[Santana with Rachel:]
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone

[Rachel:]
You know I feel okay

[Santana and Rachel:]
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

[Rachel:]
It's been a hard day's night

[Rachel with Santana:]
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do

[Rachel:]
Will make me feel all right
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right
