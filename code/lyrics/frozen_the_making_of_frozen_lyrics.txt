Song:

How is a movie made?
How are the choices chosen?
This is the making of "Frozen"

This is the making of "Frozen"
People want to know what filmmakers do
People want to know
People want to go
Behind the scenes of the movie

We're here to do that for you

How did we make (x4)
Frozen
How did we make (x4)
Frozen
How did we make (3x)
How did we make-a-make
Frozen?

Lalalalalalalala
(Baby baby whoo!)

This is the making of "Frozen"
(Yes it is!)
It's time to take you
On the path that we took

People want to know (x4)
About Frozen
We're here to give you that inside look

How did we make (x3)
How did we make-a-make
Frozen

How did we make (x4)
Frozen

How did we make (x2)
How did we make-ity, make-ity, make-ity
Make Frozen?

La, la, la, la

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Random singing)

(Whistling solo)

Every film is different
Every film's the same

Some films you never learn
How they're made
And that is a shame

But every movie's made by movie makers
In the movie making game
(Reindeers Are Better Than People)

How did we make (3x)
How did we make-a-make Frozen?

People want to know (x5)
People want to...

How did we make (x2)
How did we make-ity make-ity make-ity make Frozen?

People want to know (x5)

How did we make (x3)
How did we make-a-make Frozen?

How did we make-ity, make-ity, make-ity
Make-ity, make-ity, make-ity,
Make-ity make Frozen?

How did we make (x3)
How did we make-a-make
Frozen

People want to know (x3)

We don't know!
