Song:

Gonna find a perfect mountain
Gonna stay until I die
Drink of Mother Nature's fountain
Let my worries roll on by

Well, the good times go easy
And the bad times go slow
Even in the in-between times
I can't let my worries go

Always wanting to go somewhere
But I'd never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there
Long for things I left behind

Gonna find a perfect mountain
Gonna stay until I die
Drink of Mother Nature's fountain
Let my worries roll on by

Well, I can think of nothing better
Than a sweetheart for a friend
Before I find the two together
I'm afraid my days shall end

Always wanting to go somewhere
But I'd never fail to find
I grow tired of what I find there
Long for things I left behind

Gonna find a perfect mountain
Gonna stay until I die
Drink of Mother Nature's fountain
Let my worries roll on by
Let my worries roll on by
