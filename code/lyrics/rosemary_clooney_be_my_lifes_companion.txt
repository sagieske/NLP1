Song:

Be My Life's Companion
Mills Brothers/Rosemary Clooney
The Very Best of the Mills Brothers

Want no silver threads among the gold.
Want no silver threads among the gold.
Want no silver threads; want some action instead.
Want no silver threads among the gold.

Be my life's companion, and you'll never grow old.
I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old.
When there's joy in living, you just never grow old.
You've got to stay young, 'cause you'll never grow old.

People who are lonely are old at 33.
Don't let it happen to you; don't let it happen to me.

Be my life's companion, and you'll never grow old.
You'll never grow old, no, you'll never grow old.
Love and youth and happiness are yours to have and hold.
Be my life's companion, and you'll never grow old.

I know a man who's lonely, and he's old at 33.
No one wants to be old at 33.
Your disposition sours like a lemon on a tree.
Don't let it happen to you, and don't let it happen to me.

Be my life's companion, and you'll never grow old.
Yes, I'll love you so much that you'll never grow old.
Love and youth and happiness are yours to have and hold.
Be my life's companion, be my life's companion, and you'll never grow
old.
