Song:

What is that vitalizing sound
Calling me
In my head
Repeatedly
What is that visionary sight
Before my eyes
So prominent
So mesmerizing turbulent

You've got a hold on me
Your ingenuity
Seems to be driving me down on my knees
The force you generate
You reinvigorate
Your body talks and overstates

Well I'm already drawn
Close to the divine
Intoxicating images are rushing through my mind
Embodiment of sin
Has kindled me within
Sensation seems to multiply
They're building up inside

Cutting through the night
Radiating light
I've seen you move the crowd
I know what you're about
The stories I have heard
The talk about excess
I know what people say
But surely you impress

Charismatic pill
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one
A universal force
An automatic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

What have you done to me
This candid chemistry
Emotions running over me
And when you arch your back
Just with a stare like that
Well it's natural to interact

Well I'm not holding back
Ready to commence
Caught up in your blizzard
So confusing and intense
Synergy of two
Energy gone wild
See the stars align
To spell your name out in the sky

Never seen a sight
So fascinating right
A symetry between
Dirty and pristine
Calling out so loud
Beautiful and true
Mystery about
Everything you do

Charismatic drug
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one
A universal force
An atonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try

This electricity
Injected into me
Emotions running over me
And when you're getting close
You touch my innermost
A feeling deep inside me knows

Wonders of deligth
Cutting through the night
Known you got it all
I can't do without
Burning in my veins
Ripping through my soul
I'll never be the same
A secret can't be told

Charismatic pill
You elevated sun
Vanity and pride
Added into one
A universal force
An autonomic high
A thing I can't control
No matter how I try
