Song:

Dr. Everett V. Scott From the day he was born
He was trouble
He was the thorn
In his mother's side
She tried in vain

Criminologist But he never caused her nothing but shame

Dr. Everett V. Scott He left home the day she died
From the day she was gone
All he wanted
Was rock and roll p***
And a motorbike
Shooting up junk

Criminologist He was a low down cheap little punk

Dr. Everett V. Scott Taking everyone for a ride

Chorus When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switch blade knife

Dr. Frank-N-Furter What a guy

Janet Weiss Makes you cry

Dr. Everett V. Scott And I did

Columbia Everybody shoved him
I very nearly loved him
I said hey listen to me
Stay sane inside insanity
But he locked the door
And threw away the key

Dr. Everett V. Scott But he must've been drawn
Into something
Making him warn me
In a note which reads

Chorus What's it say? What's it say?

Eddie I'm out of my head
Oh hurry, or I may be dead
They mustn't carry out their evil deeds

Chorus When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switch blade knife

Dr. Frank-N-Furter What a guy

Janet Weiss Makes you cry

Dr. Everett V. Scott And I did

Chorus When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switch blade knife

Dr. Frank-N-Furter What a guy

Chorus Whoa ho ho

Janet Weiss Makes you cry

Chorus Hey hey hey

Dr. Everett V. Scott And I did

Chorus Eddie
