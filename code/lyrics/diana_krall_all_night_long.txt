Song:

Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is that he's every dream I dream
All night long

Never heard him say a single word of love
Don't know his fate or his soul
Cause he only speaks to me in dreams I've dreamed
All night long

When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dreams is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear

I don't want a love that's just a memory
Fate how could you be so warm
Now I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long
