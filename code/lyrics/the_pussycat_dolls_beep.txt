Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your...

'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're looking at my...
I'm a do my thing while you're playing with your...
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Every boy's the same
Since up in the seventh grade
They been trying to get with me
Trying to (Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha-ha)
They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna (Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha-ha)
I keep turning them down
But, they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down

'Cause they only want
Only want my ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha
Only want what they want
But, na, ah-ah
Na, ah-ah

Do you know that no
Don't mean yes, it means no
So just hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my two cents in it
One, just be patient
Don't be rushing
Like you're anxious
And two, you're just too aggressive
Trying to get your (Ahh)

Do you know that I know?
And I don't want to go there

Only want
Only want my ha, ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha
Only want what they want
But, na, ah-ah
Na, ah-ah

[Nicole]
Ooh, you've got it bad I can tell
You want it bad, but oh well
What you got for me
Is something I
Something I don't need
Oh oh oh!
