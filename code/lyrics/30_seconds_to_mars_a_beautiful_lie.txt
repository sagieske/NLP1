Song:

[Verse:]
Lie awake in bed at night
And think about your life
Do you want to be different? (Different...)
Try to let go of the truth
The battles of your youth
'Cause this is just a game

[Chorus:]
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me

[Verse 2:]
It's time to forget about the past
To wash away what happened last (happened last...)
Hide behind an empty face
Don't ask too much, just say
'Cause this is just a game

[Chorus:]
It's a beautiful lie
It's a perfect denial
Such a beautiful lie to believe in
So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me

Lie.... Beautiful

[Bridge:]
Everyone's looking at me
I'm running around in circles (Baby)
A quiet desperation's building higher
I've got to remember this is just a game

(Llllliiiiiiiieeeeeee)So beautiful, beautiful... X4

[Chorus:]
It's a beautiful lie ---
It's a perfect denial ---(So beautiful, beautiful)
Such a beautiful lie to believe in ---
So beautiful, beautiful lie makes me
