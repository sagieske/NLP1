Song:

In the night-light, do you see what you dream?
All your travels, are they all what they seem?
Look around you, then you may realize
All the preachers, all with their lies

And I might know of our future,
But then, you still control the past.
Only you know if you'll be together.
Only you know if we shall last!

(In the night-light)

In the night-light, do you still feel your pain?
For the valor you waited, never came!
If you were able, would you go change the past?
To mend a faux paux with one last chance!

And I might know of our future,
But then you still control the past.
Only you know if you'll be together,
Tonight!

Cause every night I will save your life!
And every night I will be with you!
Cause every night I still lay awake,
And I dream of an absolution!

Cause every night I will make it right!
And every night I will come to you!
But every night it just stays the same,
In my dream of an absolution!

(In the night-light)

In the night-light, do you see what you dream?
All your triumph, and all you'll ever be?
Look around you, then you may realize,
Happiness lies trapped in misery!

And who knows what of our future?
We can all try to change the past.
Only you know if you'll be together,
Tonight!

Cause every night I will save your life!
And every night I will be with you!
Cause every night I still lay awake,
And I dream of an absolution!

'Cause every night I will make it right!
And every night I will come to you!
But every night it just stays the same,
In my dream of an absolution!

Instrumental

Cause every night I will save your life,
And every night I will be with you!
Cause every night I still lay awake,
And I dream of an absolution!

Cause every night I will make it right,
And every night I will come to you!
But every night it just stays the same,
In my dream of an absolution!

And you'll see (And you'll see)
What you'll be (What you'll be)
And you'll see
All you can (All you can be)
And every night (And every night)
And every night (And every night)
And every night (And every night)
I will dream (I will dream)

And you'll see (And you'll see)
That this is my dream (What you'll be)
And you'll see
Every night
I will always dream (Cause every night)

And every night
And every night
I will dream (I will dream)
