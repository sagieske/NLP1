Song:

Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Don't Nobody Wanna Die, But Everybody Wanna Ball
Somebody Gotta Go, When Them Killa's Call
You Know It's In Us All, You Just Gotta Find It And Use It
You Can Get Away With It, If You Don't Abuse It
The Streets Talk, The Beats Mark, Cuz That Heat Comin'
And If They Know That You Did It, You Better Keep Runnin'
I Think I See Sumthin, There Go My Enemy
Only Lord Knows Where This n***a F'nd To Be
Tennakee, Still The Price Is As Real If You Look It
Might Give It To You For 5, Depend On If I Took It
N***a Anything Goes, My Shop Never Close
From The Nickels And The Dimes To The Whole Kilo
The Real n****s Feel Me, The Haters Wanna Kill Me
But I'm Holdin' Down My City, Me And This 9 Milli
While Your Throwin' Bricks, And Hidin' Ya Heads
Homie, I Know Where You Hang
Ain't No Thang To Walk Up And Let That Chopper Go...

[Backround]
Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Now All The Gangsta's Pray
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

Just Think If I Ain't Empty The Clip, And He Killed Me
Would I Still Be Livin'?, Would My Homeboy's Miss Me?
How Many n****s Bust They Gun When They Have To?
Don't Need No Ski Mask When It's Time To Get At You
I'm Glad You Done Seen What It Look Like When We Left
Brain Fragments From Shot-Gun Blasts'll Take A n***a Breathe
It's Death Before Dishonesty, Dope Deals And Robbery
Poppa Wasn't Around, But That s**t Didn't Bother Me
I'd Probably Be In The Penitentary
But I Played The Cards, The Dead Lord Sent To Me
The Whole Truth, I Use This Booth To Speak To My Thug n****s
Why You Mad At Me? The Government's The Drug Dealers
Before I Let This Police Kid Harass Me
This Rookie a** Cop Gon' Have To Blast Me
He Asked Me For Identification, I Looked At Him And Laughed
He Made A Move And I Heard A Blast
That's What You Get, b***h

[Backround]
Bang Bang
I Shot You Down, Bang Bang
You Hit The Ground, Bang Bang
That Awefull Sound, Bang Bang
I Used To Shoot You Down

[Young Buck:]
Now All The Gangsta's Pray
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

It's Goin Down Around Here n***a
Get Ya Muthafuckin Head Bust
Them Muthafuckin Street Lights Go Out
And Them Real n****s Come Out
All The b***h n****s Go In The House
Just Not A Game, Man
Don't f**k Around And Lose Your Brain
And Hey, All My Real n****s Pray

Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me

Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
Lord, Forgive Me
But He Tried To Kill Me
Somebody Out There Gotta Feel Me
