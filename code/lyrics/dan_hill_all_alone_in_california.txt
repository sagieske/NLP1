Song:

He caught her signal
As she strolled in the bar
Amidst all the lonely people
Out to prove they're popular
And he came upon her slowly
Not sure of what to say
Trying to sound clever - but words got in the way

Conversation wandered -
Though their eyes seldom met
They both knew what they were after
And they played it step by step
And his mind was getting foggy
The drinks were coming fast
Momentary friendship - with no future and no past

Chorus:
All alone in california
Looking for some fun
His eyes were feeling heaving
He kind of wished that he could run
The colours started spinning
As she kissed away his doubts
The night was just beginning
As his body began to meltЎ­

She watched the sunrise
While he slept in dreams unknown
And she wondered what his name was
Though she barely knew her own
And she slowly started crying
Though she wasn't white sure why
Trying to fight an emptiness
That haunted her insides.

Repeat chorus
