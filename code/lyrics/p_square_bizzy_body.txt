Verse 1
When I first saw her
She was looking like an angel light
She blow me nami mind like a dynamite
She flash like a light in ani candle light
And then she said
(All this on me)
Girl you know say when you
Move your body hold am tight
Make you no try to hurt no body
Make you dey watch your side

Omoge no bi fight and she said
(All this on me)

Boy you know say if I give you body

Cos you go loose control.... Hey
