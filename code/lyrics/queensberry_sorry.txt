Song:

I canґt help but wonder how
I would be feeling if
I wasnґt here right now
I finally decided
I donґt need another reason
For leaving you

I laid you clothes out on the bed
Donґt wanna see you here again
Put your keys through the letterbox
And just walk away

Chorus

You always get the best of me
Your lies and your apologies
Canґt understand what made me so weak
Well you could try to plea
But sorry is a word that youґll never need
See it donґt matter what you do
Cos I already know weґre through
If it ainґt feeling right whatґs the use
So you could try to plea
But sorry is a word that youґll never need

You can save those crocodile tears
Ainґt no point, tacking back, what you said
Cos I donґt want to hear it no more
Iґm justified in feeling this way. Ooh yeah

Chorus

Forget about the two of us
The picture my mind drew of us
Was just a world that I had made belive

So you could try to plea
But sorry is a word that youґll never need

Chorus
