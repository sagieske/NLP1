Song:

Oh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ill neverooohh

Girl you took my breath away,
And went out with someone new
I'd rather be here with you, baby forever
My heart belongs to you,
Cause I think about you all the time
You know my love is true when we're together
I played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up you were saying good-bye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now you're best that I had

Chorus:
I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
I promise it's true no I'll never,
I'll never find someone like you, 'cause I love the
Way that you hold. Girl I won't no I won't let you go.
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you, oh

All I have is just my heart and my feelings I gave to you
That's all that I can do is, give you forever
And oh, you don't know that you're hurtin' me
'Cause it's not just a sexual thang,
I want to share my dreams baby together
Girl I'm afraid just to give it all up
My hearts tellin' me to hold back on my love
But when you get close I just want you to know,
I start to get weak and I can't let you go

Chorus:

Just your smile
Tenderness(girl I wont let you down, wont let you down)
Girl, I will never find no one that compares to you ooh

Chorus till fade:
