Song:

Get numbers, get names, thick dames
Headhunters get brains, big thangs
Give n****s s**t stains, the s**t, man
And don't you forget, man

We be the best of cg
Greedy, abduct the pd
See me, n***a, not in 3D
Be me, hah, it's not easy

I'm breezy and off the Heezy
Me and my woman's like George and Wheezy
Movin' on up, n****s used to tease me
See me on top, it makes you queasy

Sick with it, b***h, I'm Bruce Lee
Seduce me, you're nice and juicy
In the parking lot, I gots to get mine
Why the f**k we goin' in when there's b*****s in line?

I spend my time watchin' bitches' behind
Thinkin' bad s**t in the back of my mind
I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime
Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes

And I'm in this b***h
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

I'm in this b***h
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

I'm in here, got all you freaks lookin'
When we walk by, p***y start cookin'
Rookies start tookin'
Get your a** up, V. I. P. Section's gettin' tooken

Might dance, might not, might spend enough
Cool as hell but still pipin' hot
Soon as I find a spot, all my people gather 'round
The n***a with the shiny, watch me

Ice Cube, m**********are
Next to me, you a test tube m**********are
We kinda rude, m**********are
Get too close and bucka, bucka, bucka

Don't want no problems, ya'll
F**k around, I'll pull out the problem solved
And watch E pills dissolve
Nine times out of ten, you hoes involved

And I'm in this b***h
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

I'm in this b***h
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

Get numbers, get names, thick dames
Headhunters get brains, big thangs
Give n****s s**t stains, the s**t, man
And don't you forget, man

Security pat downs, I'm a star, m**********are
I been put' the gat down, I been put the mack down
But check the people that I'm with
'Cause they'll lay you flat down

And they'll do it right now
Yeah, you scared of the phone numbers that a n***a might dial
Club-hop, car shows, picnics
Big cars, big jewels, big dicks

Rush doors or gotta hop the fence
Blow this door, gotta blow my rent
Gotta show my a**, then go repent
Gotta call in sick and tell 'em where I went

And I'm in this b***h
With a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

I'm in this b***h
Who got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll?
About to spend this b***h
I'm in this b***h
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
About to spend this b***h

You know, you know
You know, you know
I got a hundred dollar bill, ya'll
