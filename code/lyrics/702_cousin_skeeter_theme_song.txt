Song:

You know how he does, and you how he flows
All I wanna do is hug ya cause I like your steelo
And I dig the way you move, and the way you do your thing
Skeeter keep it comin' on 'cause we'll love you plain same

Skeeter's the one for me, he knows how to get down, knows how to party, baby
All the girls love his style
Skeeter drives us wild with his high profile

You stay on my mind (on my mind)
On each and every...(every show, yeah)
Skeeter is what I want, Skeeter is what I need
I love your dark-brown eyes
Let's sit and watch tv, yeah!
