Big Tone:
I got a good feeling about this one

Tae Yang:
Oooh yeaaah~ Ooooh

Big Tone:
To all the fly woman across the globe
(Girl you know you're my connection) uh huh
(Girl you know you're my connection) uh huh
(Girl you know you're my connection) right here
Let's break it down for them.

Tae Yang:
It's true, I got a thang for you
All of the things you do.
Got me feeling butterflies
I know
You feel the same cause it shows
Trust me girl, I see the glow
Every time I look in your eyes

(Bridge)
I never thought it could be (never thought)
Cause truthfully you should be (ooh yeaah)
Living deep within my dreams where I would never find you
But you're the real thing baby
Our chemistry is crazy
And I'm really feeling this connection inside, yea

(Chorus)
Girl it's real it's my confession
Heaven sent, you're such a blessing
I feel
A love connection
When I'm with you
All them girls, they keep me guessing
Had my picks, you're my selection
I feel
A love connection
When I'm with you

When I
See you from day to day
There's so much I want to say
But I try not to come up too strong (come up too strong)
From now, I just say what I feel
Cause this connection is real
This just feels too right to be wrong (ooh yeaah)

I never thought it could be (I never thought)
Cause truthfully you should be (oh you should be)
Living deep within my dreams where I would never find you (I shouldn't find you)
But you're the real thing baby (oh you're the real thing)
Our chemistry is crazy
And I'm really feeling this connection inside, (girl it's real! )

Girl it's real it's my confession (Hey! )
Heaven sent, you're such a blessing (I feel)
I feel
A love connection
When I'm with you
All them girls, they keep me guessing
Had my picks, you're my selection (whooaa~)
I feel
A love connection (yeaa)
When I'm with you (whoaa)

Big Tone & Taeyang:
Okay (I'm feeling the connection)
Lady (I'm feeling the connection)
Baby (I'm feeling the connection)
You got me, feeling the connection
That's right I'm (feeling the connection)
All this time (that I'm investing)
All you got to do is to say yes and
I'll be with you

Big Tone:
I'm been around girl and that's no lie
See my share but no comparing you
Damn you just too fly
The way you lick your lips and just touch my spots
I need you Miss in my life like hip needs a hop
You're a goddess so here's my confession
I been lost till I found you my blessing
You're beautiful, I'm saying more than complexion
My body gets so weak feel that connection

Tae Yang:
Feel that connection! 

Girl it's real it's my confession (yeah)
Heaven sent, you're such a blessing (you're a blessing baby)
I feel
A love connection
When I'm with you
All them girls, they keep me guessing
Had my picks, you're my selection
I feel
A love connection
When I'm with you
