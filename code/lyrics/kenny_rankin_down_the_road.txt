Song:

The Land Of Mystic Emerald Seas
In Fields Of Soft, Sweet Clover
Sons Of Old Killarney
When Will This Fight Be Over?

Is It Our Human Fate
Or Merely A Twisted Fable
That We're Haunted By The Hate
That Sprang From Cain And Abel

Down The Road, Down The Road
We Are Walking The Same Path
To The Judgement Day
Down The Road, Down The Road
We Are Walking The Same Path
To The Judgement Day

Sons Of Old Killarney
Keepers Of The Celtic Lore
Why Must We Deny Our Hearts
To Raise Young Sons For War?

She's Praying For An Answer
She Knows May Never Come
Knowing That The Questions
Were Never Settled With A Gun

Down The Road, Down The Road
We Are Walking The Same Path
To The Judgement Day
Down The Road, Down The Road
We Are Walking The Same Path
To The Judgement Day

She's Praying For An Answer
She Knows May Never Come
Knowing That The Questions
Were Never Settled With A Gun

Down The Road, Down The Road
We Are Walking The Same Path
To The Judgement Day
