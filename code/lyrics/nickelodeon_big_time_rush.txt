Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.

Make it count,
Play it straight.
Don't look back,
Don't hesitate.
When you go big time.

Whatcha know,
Whatcha feel.
Never quit,
And make it real.
When you roll big time.

[Ohhhhh.]
Hey! [Ohhhh] Hey! [Ohhhhh]
Listen to your heart now!
Hey! [Ohhhh] Hey! [Ohhhhh]
Don't you feel the rush?
Hey! [Ohhhh] Hey! [Ohhhhh]
Better take your shot now.

Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Ohhhh Ohhhhh.

Cmon shake it up!
Whatcha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose,
If you want it all,
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.

Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.

Step it up,
Get in gear.
Go for broke,
Make it clear.
Gotta go big time.

Make it work,
Get it right.
Change the world over night.
Gotta dream big time.

Whatcha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose,
If you want it all,
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.

Look around,
Every light is shining now,
It's brighter somehow.
Look around,
Nothings really as it seems,
Nothing but dreams.
You and I,
Gonna make a brand new sound,
Like we own this town.

We can fly,
Now our feet are off the ground,
We'll never look down.
Welcome to the big time,
All the pretty people see you walking in the sunshine.
Welcome to the good times,
Life will never be the same.

Cmon shake it up!
Whatcha gotta lose?
Go and make your luck with the life you choose,
If you want it all,
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.

Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
Oh Oh Ohhhh Ohhhhh.
If you want it all,
Lay it on the line.
It's the only life ya got,
So ya gotta live it big time.
