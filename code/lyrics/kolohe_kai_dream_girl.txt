Song:

All through, my days at school
I often think of you, my darling baby boo
Your always in my head, that's why I can't wait to go to bed, to close my eyes and visualize, you right by my side.

*Chorus*
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up.
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up, please don't wake me up.

We're walking hand in hand in Disneyland, then we're at the grand canyon, soon we'll be on the moon, that afternoon walking on the sand.
My Hawaiian baby girl, in my dreams your always near.
But in the morning, there's a warning, that you won't be here

*Chorus*
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up.
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up, please don't wake me up.

Oh my girl we can go anywhere
Just say the place and I'll take you there.
In this dream I can be your King, and you my love, 
You can be my queen... 

*Chorus*
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up.
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world, 
I'm in love with you, please don't wake me up, please don't wake me up
