Song:

"Bye bye, baby" Cybil says as she walks out the door.
You can bet that Hollywood looks oh-so-good,
Much better than it ever has before.
So my pets have left me in search of careers and richer soils,
Heading off to pure-bread friends and happy ends
And anything to prove I'm disloyal.

It's not just that I'm selfish and scared,
It's not just that I'm so unprepared.
It's just you'd think I'd grow out of this, wouldn't you?

So take me to winter, as if it was discontent I'd see.
I'll live with the madmen there and pull my hair
'cause lunacy is everything I need.

It's not just that I'm selfish and scared,
It's not just that I'm so unprepared.
It's just you'd think I'd grow out of this, wouldn't you?

"Bye bye, baby" Cybil says as she walks out the door.
You can bet that Hollywood looks oh-so-good,
Much better than it ever has before.
