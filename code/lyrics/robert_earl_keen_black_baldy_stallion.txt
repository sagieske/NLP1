Song:

Slidin' down the canyon on the Black Baldy Stallion
Through the rocks and the ridges of the cold dark night
Shinin' like a diamond from the belt of Orion
Is it your imagination, is the end in sight?

From the top of the mountain to the edge of the water
You can hear her singin' softly so you spring to the order
Of the song she was singin' the first time you saw her
The years melt away as you ride toward the border.

Such a long, long way to ride
Just to hear her say your name
When you reach the other side
You won't leave her again.

It's a resonating wonder how you've never knuckled under
To the Elders of the village on that early Easter mornin'
Cause you never broke your promises and bonding her is all there is
Ridin' through the river in the fiery dawnin'.

Such a long, long way to ride
Just to hear her say your name
When you reach the other side
You won't leave her again.

(Guitar solo)

Sittin' in the cafe on the corner of the plaza
She's openin' the letter you could not deliver
As the Black Baldy Stallion riderlessly passes
Gleamin' in the sun drippin' water from the river

Such a long, long way to ride
Just to hear her say your name
When you reach the other side
You won't leave her again.

... A long, long way to ride
Just to hear her say your name
When you reach the other side
You won't leave her again.

You won't leave her again.
