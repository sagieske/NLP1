Song:

The Minute you walked in the joint
I could tell you were a man of distinction
A real big spender good looking so refine
Wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind.

[Bridge:]
So let me get right to the point
I don't pop my cork for every guy I see

[Chorus:]
Hey Big Spender
Spend a little time with me

Wouldn't you like too have fun fun fun
Hows about a few laughs laughs
I can show you a good time
I can show you a good time

[Bridge:]
So let me get right to the point I don't pop my cork for every guy I see

[Chorus:]
Hey Big spender
Hey big spender
Hey! Big spender
Spend a little time with me
Hey!
