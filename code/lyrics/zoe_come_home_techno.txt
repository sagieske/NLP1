Song:

When will you come home
When will you be mine
I have waited so long just to see you smile
So tell me why do only theese feelings in me
Call upon your name
Why do all these dreams with in me
Always end the same?

When will you come home..

When will you come home..

When will you come home
When will you be mine
I have waited so long just to se you smile
So tell me why do only feelings in me
Call upon your name
Why do all these dreams with in me
Always end the same?

When will you come home
When will you come home
When will you come home
When will you come home
When will you come home
When will you come home
When will you come home

When will you come home
When will you be mine
I have waited so long just to see you smile
So tell me why do all these feelings in me
Call upon your name
Why do all these dreams with in me
Always end the same?
