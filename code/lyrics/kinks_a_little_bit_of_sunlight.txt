Song:

Tears would fall like the falling rain,
There would be a sea.
But you don't have to cry to prove your love,
Just believe in me.

[Chorus]
Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,
A little bit of sunlight,
Is all that I want,
All that I want,
All that I want from you.

A man who can't live with cloudy skies,
Should only wait and see.

Soon all the clouds will disappear,
And leave just you and me.

[Chorus]
