Song:

I've been lying through my teeth today
To keep in sight and you from him tonight
But you'll bite on every word he'll say
I don't know why you buy them over and over again
So don't pretend that this feels right
I feel fine
(Taste me, wont you crave me every night, night
And chase me girl, I'll make you feel alright, right
There's a brighter bright on the other side, side
So take me for yourself and I will show you why
There's a brighter bright)
You're the rabbit, he's the bird of prey
And you'll run right into his grip tonight
'Cause you love the way he gets you laid
There's no escaping only scraping along for the ride
And I can't bear to watch you cry
Please don't cry
(Chorus)
There's a brighter bright
I'm waiting till you're crazy enough to try
There's a brighter bright
And I can't bear to watch you cry
Please don't cry
Taste me, wont you crave me every night
And chase me girl, I'll make you feel alright
(Chorus)
