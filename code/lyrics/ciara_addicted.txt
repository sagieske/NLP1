Song:

Ah you know i just can't help it
Ah a bad habbit i'm hooked he's got me i can't break it

One hit, can't quit, last sip, thatz it
Quick fix, don't fall, withdraw
Hell NAW!!
Cant put down the bottles, tipsy got me throwed off
Tryin not to stumble
Slurrin wordz that mumble sayin

Baby x3
Ya poisons got me up and down, head spinnin round and round
Im goin crazy, crazy, take me
Boy u got that ghetto love, i just can't get enough

That's why, im so addicted
Im feelin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, u got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
Im an addict, gotta have it baby

Go go, slow slow, more more, pour, pour
Oh boy u got me wired
Hyper but im tired
Sweatin hot like fire
I can't get enough im so...

Baby x3
Ya poisons got me up and down, head spinnin round and round
Im goin crazy, crazy, take me
Boy u got that ghetto love, i just can't get enough

That's why, im so addicted
Im feelin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, u got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
Im an addict, gotta have it baby

Got my lightz in my trunk
Let it glow, feel the bass
Let it bump, let it bump
Down here in the A
We can kick it wit my girlz
We can kick it wit the boys
If u feel me make some noise (Hit It)
One, two, three

Now you really got to get it
Fired Up! Fired Up!
Put ya hands up to the ceilin
Higher! Higher!
If you wit me, let me see ya
Lighters! Lighters!
Cuz u really got me feelin' bad
One more hit I need it bad

Im so addicted
Im feelin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, u got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
Im an addict, gotta have it baby

Im so addicted
Im feelin' for ya baby
I really need it
So hit me up, u got that stuff I like
That's so so fine
Hit me one more time
Im an addict, gotta have it baby

Im so addicted (oh oh oh oh oh)
I really need it (oh oh oh oh oh)
Im so addicted (oh oh oh oh oh)
I really need it (i need it, ha ha)
