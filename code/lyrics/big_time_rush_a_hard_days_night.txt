Song:

[James]
It's been a Hard Day's Night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a Hard Day's Night
I should be sleeping like a log
[Logan]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
[James]
Will make me feel alright
{Kendall]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
[Logan]
So why on Earth should I moan,
Cause when I get you alone
[Kendall]
You know I feel ok
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, I feel you holding me tight, tight yeah
[Carlos]
It's been a Hard Day's Night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a Hard Day's Night
I should be sleeping like a log
[Logan]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
[Carlos]
Will make me feel alright
[Logan]
So why on Earth should I moan,
Cause when I get you alone
[James]
Will make me feel
[Kendall]
Ok
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home, I feel you holding me tight, tight yeah
[James]
It's been a Hard Day's Night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a Hard Day's Night
I should be sleeping like a log
[Logan]
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
[James]
Will make me feel
[Kendall]
Alright, [alright]
[James]
Will make me feel
[Kendall]
Alright, [yeah]
[James]
You know I feel Alright
