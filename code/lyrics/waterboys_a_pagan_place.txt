Song:

How did he come heer?
Who gave him the key?
Slipped in his hand
So secretly
Who put the colour
Like lines on his face
And brought him here
To a pagan place?
Who shot the arrow?
How high did it fly?
When he tipped it
With poison
Did he even know why?
What unseen hand
Brought him
Face to face to face to face with
All this and more
In a pagan place?
Come into my parlour
Sail in at my shore
Drink my soul dry
There is always more
There is always more after
Now fly on my carpet
Look into my face
And see the
Heart of Man
In a Pagan
In a Pagan
In a Pagan
In a Pagan
In a Pagan
Pagan........
