Light 'em up!

Yeah!

Lookin' good through the window
Shinin' red and blue light, yeah
A little thick in the bottom
But still lookin' alright, yeah

Got a pocket full o' money
Got me a long night ahead
Quick stop by the Bulldog
Score me some Panama Red, yeah

Oh, wham bam, oh Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
Stone you like nothin' else can (Yeah yeah yeah)
Woo! Hot damn, roll an Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
She can't then nothin' else can

Uh! Caught a plane outta Moscow
Spent one cold night in Berlin, yeah
It's a long hard way but I'm a-comin'
Back again, yeah

Oh, wham bam, oh Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
Stone you like nothin' else can (Yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah, come on up, roll an Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
If she can't then no one else can

Yeah!
Yeow!

(Guitar Solo)

Ohhh!

Yeow!

Oh, wham bam, oh Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
Will stone you like nothin' else can (Yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah, hot damn, roll an Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
If she can't then no one else can (Yeah yeah yeah)
Woo! Wham bam, oh Amsterdam (Yeah yeah yeah)
Don't have to worry 'bout the man (Yeah yeah yeah)
Woo! Hot damn, uh, burn an Amsterdam, yeah (Yeah yeah yeah)
Stone me like nothin' else can (Yeah yeah yeah)
