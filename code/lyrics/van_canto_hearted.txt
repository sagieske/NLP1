Song:

[Storyteller:]
"Once in lands far beyond
He would better never ever
Having started journeys in worlds down below
He has now choices now
Has to get back somehow"

[Pathfinder:] "What if I break down?"
[Demon:] "I'll welcome you here!"

[Pathfinder:] "No!"
[Demon:]
"What you name a world below
Will rise as worlds are turning though"
[Pathfinder:]
"I resist and I refuse if I had a chance to choose, I would escape!"
[Demon:] "Pushed onto the ground"

[Storyteller:]
"And as the story goes a sallow light appears
It's taking shape: An angel sings to ease the fear"

[Angel:]
"In dark hours so cruel
When you feel blackhearted
Remember the words
You once had said
If you trust in yourself
You will live lighthearted
Destiny's calling
Be there to change your fate"

[II BATTLE]

[Storyteller:]
"Once as time was moving on"

[Demon:]
"Blame me for forsaking you?
If I let you, I would do!"
[Pathfinder:]
"You won't crawl into my mind
Leave me speechless leave me blind
Still I can hear you"
[Demon:]
"I growl and die inside"

[Storyteller:]
"And he then turns around"

[Pathfinder:]
"Now that you see me stand alone
Will you come for me?"
[Angel:] "I listen, I'm on my way"
[Pathfinder:] "I need a guide by my side, so I will"
[Angel:]
"I will help you to
See clearer one day"

[Storyteller:]
"And as the story goes the sallow light returns
It's spending light and warmth as the fire burns"

[Angel:]
"In dark hours so cruel
When you feel blackhearted
Remember the words
You once had said
If you trust in yourself
You will live lighthearted
Destiny's calling
No fate is sealed
If you trust in yourself
You will live lighthearted
Destiny's calling
Be there to change your fate
And rise a new day"
[Angel:] "Return to places beneath my skies"
[Demon:] "I'm leaving but will return"
[Angel:] "A look inside makes you weak and blind"
[Demon:] "No more! In hell you shall burn!"

[III REDEMPTION]

[Storyteller + Angel:] "Fly high to worlds far away"
[Pathfinder:]
"I would better never ever
Having started journeys in worlds down below
I've been uncaged somehow
Start a new glory now
Is there a lesson to learn?
I will return! 
In dark hours so cruel
When I felt blackhearted
I remembered the words
I once had said
Yes I trust in myself
Feel strong and lighthearted
Destiny's calling
I will be there
Every task to be done
I'll carry out bravehearted
A mission to face?
I'll stand my ground
And in every night
You will shine lighthearted
This story may end
Another one will unfold"
Story teller:
"For now this story shall end"
