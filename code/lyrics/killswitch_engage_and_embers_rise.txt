Song:

(It's all a nothing, been dead for??)?
For far too long the illusion falters
This illusion falters
Suffering (suffering)
Despite the struggle
Remaining helpless
My heart can no longer (my heart can no longer)
No longer be frozen (no longer)

Take my?
I will never
Never leave you

It must be now, we must (revolt)?
Invoke the strength, turn the tide, stop (it)? Now (yea)

Take my?
I will never
Never leave you

The winds of change will cleanse away
What still remains
Let our doubts and indecision pass away

Take my?
I will never
Never leave you

My
Life
From
Yours

Free? (my)
Again (life)
My life (from)
?

(Go!)
