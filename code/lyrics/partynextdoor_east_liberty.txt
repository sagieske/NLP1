Song:

[Verse:]
The summer's over and we're watchin' the sun finally set
Seems like it's forever now, but forever's here

[Pre-Hook:]
Cruise out of the town in a rental
The same in the silence crescendo
But you the only one I miss
Cause you the only one I..
Summer's over, and I feel the same way you do
Yea, yea

[Hook:]
Come on baby, girl come on
Come on baby, girl come on
You don't want a lazy lover
Just switch your model find another
Come on baby, come oh girl
Come home baby, come home girl
How you feelin', how you feel?
Let a real one take the wheel

[Verse 2:]
Girl the summer's fallin' and we're watchin' the sun finally set
Sometimes I hear the ocean, while drivin' down Oceans
Girl the ocean's callin' your name

[Pre-Hook:]
Cruise out of the town in a rental
The same in the silence crescendo
But you the only one I miss
Cause you the only one I..
Summer's over, and I feel the same way you do
Yea, yea

[Hook:]
Come on baby, girl come on
Come on baby, girl come on
You don't want a lazy lover
Just switch your model find another
Come on baby, come oh girl
Come home baby, come home girl
How you feelin', how you feel?
Let a real one take the wheel

[Outro:]
Come on baby
Come home baby
How you feelin' how you feel?
Let a real one take the wheel
