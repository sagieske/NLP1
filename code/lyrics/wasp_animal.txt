Song:

Well I have a treat for you all, the lyric's to "Animal (f**k like a beast)
By wasp......... Here Goes......
I got pictures of naked ladies
Lying on their beds
I whiff that smell and sweet convulsion
Starts a-Swelling inside my head
I'm making artificial lovers for free
I start to howl I'm in heat
I moan and growl and the hunt drives me crazy
I f**k like a Beast
Chorus:
I come round, round I come feel your love
Tie you down, down I come steal your love
I come round, round I come feel your love
Tie you down, down I come steal your love
I'm on the prowl and I watch you closely
I lie waiting for you
I'm the wolf with the sheepsskins clothing
I lick my chops and your tasting good
I do whatever I want to, to ya
I'll nail your a** to the sheets
A pelvic thrust and the sweat starts to sting ya
I f**k like a beast
Repeat Chorus
Come ride, savage seduction
Ride, ride, ride
Repeat Chorus
