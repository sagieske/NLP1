Song:

Why. Your phone that was turned off again yesterday night
Why do you make me go crazy like this
Just how many times
will something like this repeat

Why is my bad premonition right
With my friend’s accidental call
I know now
That everything is a lie

You deceived me, even your tears were all a show
Up till now, I believed everything if it were your words
You deceived me, I was a fool
How could you pathetically play with me till the end

Oh no, oh no
(Yeah, I was a fool for believing you till the end. Who would I blame, I’m
the fool)
No more, no more
(I won’t be decieved anymore)
Show show show, don’t put on a show

No matter what anyone else said, I believed you
I begged the sky, but you deceived me thoroughly
My life is twisted because of you
There’s no use even if I beg anymore
I can’t even believe your tears
You love me? Don’t make me laugh
I won’t be decieved anymore. Don’t put on a show

Tears aren’t worth it for a girl like you
It’s better off this way. Live like that
I want to erase you, throw you away
You were never with me

You deceived me, even your tears were all a show
Up till now, I believed everything if it were your words
You deceived me, I was a fool
How could you pathetically play with me till the end

Oh no, oh no
(Yeah, I was a fool for believing you till the end. Who would I blame, I’m
the fool)
No more, no more
(I won’t be decieved anymore)

Everything really (everything)
I wish it were all a dream (a dream)
It’s making me crazy (It’s making me crazy)
I won’t love again now
You deceived me, even your tears were all a show
Up till now, I believed everything if it were your words
You deceived me, I was a fool
How could you pathetically play with me till the end

Oh no, oh no
(Yeah, I was a fool for believing you till the end. Who would I blame, I’m
the fool)
No more, no more
(I won’t be decieved anymore)
Show show show, don’t put on a show
