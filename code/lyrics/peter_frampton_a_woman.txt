Song:

Oh woman, Oh woman, Oh what can she be?
Whatever she is, she's necessary.

A woman is something both evil and good,
But too complicated to be understood.
An angel when lovin', a devil when mad.
A woman can make you both happy and sad.

Afraid of a cricket, she'll scream at a mouse.
But she'll tackle a husband as big as a house.
She'll take him for better, she'll take him for worse.
She'll bust his head open and then be his nurse.

(This verse I'm not sure of)

She's spiteful, deceitful, keen sighted and blind.
????? And crafty and cruel and kind.
In the morning she does, in the evening she don't.
You're always a thinkin' she will but she won't.

Oh woman, oh woman, oh what can she be?
What ever she is, she's necessary.

These are the words for "A Man" as close as I can remember

A man, oh a man, any woman will say,
Whatever he is, we like him that way.

A man is a creature we can't overlook.
As easy to read as a page in a book.

That's all I can remember of "A Man"
Can someone fill in the rest for me?
