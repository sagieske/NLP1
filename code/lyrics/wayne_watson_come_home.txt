Song:

I looked out across the field
At the sundown gold
Don't feel so young anymore
But sure don't feel old
And I remember you as a child
Running 'round free
You would play through the day into nighttime
Till you could not see
Chorus
Come home - come home
Night is falling but the lights are on
Come home - come home
Night is falling and it won't be long
I'll turn my head
And you'll be grown
I stood in the dark by the window
Lookin' for your lights
I sleep better knowing everybody's home
And everybody's alright
Just one of those things that happen
When you care so much
And you pray to keep from worryin'
Then you worry you ain't prayin' enough
Repeat Chorus
We are all just children - even your momma and me
And everybody gone before us
From this family
And God, the good, good Father watches
Those He call His own
And one day when we're through growin'
He's gonna call us home and he'll say
Come home - come home
Night is falling but the lights goes on
Come home - come home
Night had fallin and it's been so long
Since we've been together
Gonna be here forever
Come home, come on home
