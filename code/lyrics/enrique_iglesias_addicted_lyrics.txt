Song:

Have I told you how good it feels to be me,
When I'm in you?
I can only stay clean
When you are around.
Don't let me fall.
If I close my eyes forever,
Would it ease the pain?
Could I breathe again?

[Chorus:]
Maybe I'm addicted,
I'm out of control,
But you're the drug
That keeps me from dying.
Maybe I'm a liar,
But all I really know is
You're the only reason I'm trying.

I am wasted away,
I made a million mistakes.
Am I too late?
There is a storm in my head;
It rains on my bed
When you are not here.
I'm not afraid of dying,
But I am afraid of losing you.

[Chorus:]
Maybe I'm addicted,
I'm out of control,
But you're the drug
That keeps me from dying.
Maybe I'm a liar,
But all I really know is
You're the only reason I'm trying.

When you're lying next to me
Love is going through to me.
Oh it's beautiful.
Everything is clear to me
'till I hit reality
And I lose it all...
I lose it all...
I lose it all.
I lose it all...
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah....
Nah nah nah nah nah nah.....
Nah nah nah nah nah nah....

You're the only reason,
Yeah, you're the only reason I'm trying,
Oh, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying,
Don't want to lose it all,
Don't want to lose it all,
I'm trying, I'm trying..
I'm trying...
Yeah, you know I'm addicted,
You know I'm addicted,
Yeah, you know I'm addicted....
