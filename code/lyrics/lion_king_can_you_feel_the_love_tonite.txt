Song:

Timon-
I can see whats happening....
Pumba-
What!
Timon-
.. And they don't have a clue..
Pumba-
Who!
Timon-
.. They'll fall in love and heres the bottom line.. Our trios down to two
Pumba-
Oh..

Timon-
The sweet caress of twilight
Theres magic, everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disasters in the air!!!

[Chorus:]-
Can you feel, the love tonight...
The peace the evening brings
The world for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things.

Simba-
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see.
The truth about my past.. Impossible!
She'd turn away from me..

Nala-
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what I can't decide.
Why wont he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside......

[Chorus:]-
Can you feel, the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight
You need'nt look too far
Stealing through, the nights uncertanies
Love is where they are......

Timon-
And if, he falls, in love, tonight....*sniff*
It can be, assumed...

Pumba-
His carefree days, with us are history...

Both-
In short our pal... Is doomed
