Song:

I'm so hypnotized, open the days, mesmerized
I'm tryina visualize you right now, keep me cool right now
I like to be optimistic, you and me, that's futuristic
We can fly high like a spaceship, zoom right now, to the moon right now

You want me all alone
Yeah, I heard that before
But first I gotta know
Gotta know if you insecure
Can you take control?
Tell me baby, can you break my lips?
Boy, I gotta know
Wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this, built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this

Too fly for you, have to go
So cold like a popsicle
Row deep when we at the show
Guest list, Becky G plus Mexico
You don't know what you do to me
Got me acting all stupidly
And from my love I speak truthfully
In a world full of lies you're the truth to me

You want me all alone
Yeah, I heard that before
But first I gotta know
Gotta know if you insecure
Can you take control?
Tell me baby, can you break my lips?
Boy, I gotta know
Wanna know if you're built for this
Built for this, built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this

I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this

You want me all alone
But first I gotta know
Can you take control?
Boy, I gotta know
Wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
I wanna know if you're built for this
