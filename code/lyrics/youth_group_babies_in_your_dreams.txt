Song:

Headlines shout their announcements out
About a baby boom.
Your mind grows restless, you pace the floor, 
Walking from room to room.

You're picking teams, 
You want something not seen, 
Babies in your dreams.
Nighttimes go by, 
A lightbulb in your eye
And a reason to cry.
I can't go on without a song to sing
And something to love.

I can't argue with a rock, 
If you love it then you share it.
Our lines grow deeper, the dough is set, 
We harden into our parents.

Woken by screams, 
Prams in the stream, 
Nothing's as it seems.
Traffic goes by, 
Looking for a new high
And a reason to try.
I can't go on without a song to sing
And something to love.

The desert blooms green, 
You're trying to touch a moonbeam, 
Babies in your dreams.
Dancers float by, 
A spiritual lie, 
No reason to cry.
I can't go on without a song to sing.
I can't go on without love.
I can't go on without a song to sing
And something to love.
