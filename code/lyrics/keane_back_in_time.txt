Song:

I've got time to kill
I'm not living for the moment anymore
I don't wanna wake up
I've got time to kill
I'm not living for the future anymore
I don't wanna wake
I don't wanna wake up

She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time

Time, I wait for you
Hibernating, hoping life will start again
Petal in the water
The days all seem the same
I dream by day, I shut the light out, I escape
I don't wanna wake
I don't wanna wake up

She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time

Slumping backwards, I forget, I forget
Time has wrapped it's drowsy arms around my neck
Don't wanna wake up
Don't wanna wake up

She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time
She goes back in time

And back again
And back again
