Song:

Hold me tight
as I try
to stand drifted then
landed on the soft ground
I was a stranger
from who knows where
when I hear your voice
I don't know the words
why the hell should I care?

I suddenly openned my eyes
I came around by accident
there a some kinds of love
who can bring you down
like a wave of fear
I felt so lone
far away from my home
and my heart exploded
and I just said
why the hell should I care?
