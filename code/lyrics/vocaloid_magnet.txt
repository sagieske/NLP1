Song:

In my very soul a small flame began to lit
The passion that grew couldn't even fit
A butterfly I wandered as, I fell into your gentle hands
Then our very spirits began to dance
Intertwining our fingers one by one
And still they think we are too young
I will never let go of this feeling
I don't know what's this meaning?

I need you to embrace me tight
And say farewell every night
Cause no matter what they do, I'll be by your side
Kiss me like there's hope
I'll keep holding onto the rope
I know that this was really no mistake, my darling

If you try to run away, I'll pull you back to me
Because this way, I know you'll never leave
Call this weird, but I can't escape from it, No surely not one bit
Lets take this to a tango

If it seems I've gone astray
Will I melt like snow?
How could somone feel this perfect in a way?
I fear, don't let this be a foe

Baby this is no dream
My dear it's the real thing
If we touch, we can never go back
But that's ok because loving you is something I never lack

As the clouds are gray, and rain gets heavy
I start to cry uncontrollably
You whispered. "It'll be fine"
But really, are you even mine?

Eed you to embrace me tight
And say farewell every night
Cause no matter what they do, I'll be by your side
Kiss me like there's hope
I'll keep holding onto the rope
I know that this was really no mistake, oh god!

Pull me closer, as if we were two magnets
That if your lost, I'll draw you back to me
Don't you know, we can never go back
Because remember, loving you is something I nevrer lack, baby!
