Song:

I see you standing on the corner with your dress so high
And all the cars slow down as they see you driving by
Thought you said you had some place to go
What you doing up here putting it all on show?

Darling it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

Do you remember Darling how we laughed and cried
We said we'd be together till the day we died
How could something so good turn so bad?
I'd do it all again 'coz you're the best I've ever had

Darling it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight

See that man with the glad hands
I want to kill him but it wouldn't be right
Now here comes another man with the gladbags
I want to break him but it's not my fight
In one hand and out the other
Baby I don't even know why you bother

Darling it hurts to see you down Darlinghurst tonight
