Song:

I did my time
I paid my price
For all these things I did
I lost my feet
You said your piece
I thought that that was it

So when you sleep so peacefully
And all your sins are buried deep
While you're dreaming I'm outside
Digging up the ones I missed

When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around again
I don't ever know
When it's coming back again
You can try all you want
But the past knows what you did
And I can't seem to get away from it
When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around
Baby coming back around again

I've been chewed up
I've been spit out
But never thought to quit
I've taken blows
And felt them all
But nothing close to this

So when you sleep so peacefully
And all your sins are buried deep
While you're dreaming I'm outside
Digging up the ones I missed

When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around again
I don't ever know
When it's coming back again
You can try all you want
But the past knows what you did
And I can't seem to get away from it
When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around
Baby coming back around again

My back's against the wall
I'm feeling for the door
But I can't find it
As the knife slides into me
And as I'm standing there
She walks in
And blurry fears are coming clear
And I can finally see

When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around again
I don't ever know
When it's coming back again
You can try all you want
But the past knows what you did
And I can't seem to get away from it
When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around
Baby coming back around again

When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around again
When it's coming back again

And I can't seem to get away from it
When's it coming back again
When's it coming back around
Baby coming back around
Coming back around
Baby coming back around again
