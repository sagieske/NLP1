Song:

Sometimes, you just gotta, go! 

You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he?
See, I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

And we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as an old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins the Mandela peace prize

You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he?
See, I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

And it ain't no projects
Keeping it real is not an understood concept
Yeah, complexion's not a contest
Cause racism has no context
Hip hop ain't got a section called conscious
Everybody rappin' like crack never happened
Crips never occurred, no Bloods to attack them
Matter of fact no hood to attack in
Somalia is a great place to relax in
Fred Astaire was the first to do a backspin
The Rat Pack was cool group of black men
That inspired five white guys called The Jacksons
Eminem fitted in but then again he inspired a black rapper tryin to mimic
Him
And that's what really rose up out of Michigan, the sign of white rapper by
The name of 50 Cent

You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he?
See, I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

And I know it's just a fantasy
I cordially invite you to ask why can't it be?
Now we can't do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make it fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queenin', every man a Kingin'
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black everything

You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he?
See, I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything
