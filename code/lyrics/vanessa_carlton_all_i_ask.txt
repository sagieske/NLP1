Song:

Fumbling down a road lined with signs
It's obvious I'm in the wrong direction
And I won't stop now you know I feel fine
Just looking for some affection

All I ask is to be able to hold on longer
And all I ask is to be able to walk on water
Walk on water

I figure it won't be long it won't be hard
I've just got to get my feet back on the ground
Just got a hold of some unlucky cards
And I have yet to make another round

All I ask is to be able to hold on longer
And all I ask is to be able to walk on water
Walk on water

No one lent a hand
No one laid a look upon me
Invisible to everything but blame
No one cared to tell
No one dared to believe in anything
And left me to drown in this place

All I ask is to be able to hold on longer
And all I ask is to be able to walk on water
Walk on water
