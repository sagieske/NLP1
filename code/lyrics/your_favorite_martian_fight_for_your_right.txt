Song:

Kick it!

You wake up late for school man you don't wanna go
You ask your mom, "Please?" but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Your pops caught you smoking and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, "Not this again"
Mom you're just jealous because we're yfm

You gotta fight
For your right
To party

Party!
Party!
