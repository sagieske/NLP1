Song:

(Williams / Hutchins)

I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now your on your own
cause I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

They say the devil loves his own
And lady you just got the roll
He drives you modus-operandi
Well lady you don't get this soul
What you call love I can't take no more
Go knock on someone else's door

I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now your on your own
cause I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

Cause you specialise your own kind of lies
Lady you just hit and run
I just wanna say you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

I try to love you my way
But lady you just wouldn't slow down
You drove a right on through me
When other guys came around
What you call love wouldn't give to a stray
I wouldn't treat a dog that way

I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now your on your own
cause I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

Cause you specialise your own kind of lies
Lady you just hit and run
I just wanna say you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

One day you'll have to slow down
And lady it could be too late
You keep on acceleratin'
And lady I could see your fate
No-one wants a second-hand car
They know it been push too far

I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now your on your own
cause I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

Cause you specialise your own kind of lies
Lady you just hit and run
You're draggin'me down with this riding around
And one day you will be undone

I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now your on your own
cause I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun
