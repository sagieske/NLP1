Song:

For this common penchant for chase
I wouldn't trade for anything
As in this world I live in design
For your desire
In the confines of mind
I've been given the choice to sail with my doubts
But nothing makes it ever enough
I have to make the biggest mistake to find myself out

That I would brave everything
It includes walking through fire
I've burnt alright all day and night
You know what I need back

For this enveloping fondness for bullets
Taking shots, taking turns
But in this world I only live in design
By doing everything to become your only desire
We course in our own world of great
The two-faced wonder that I only knew of late

But nothing makes it ever enough
I had to make the biggest mistake to find it all out
