Song:

You come to me crying with your head hung down
You say that you're trying
But you can't change now
I know your pain is real
I know that you're but still
There's just so much I can do
Ashes on the table, shoes on the floor
Talking like a hundred other times before
You know I'm into you, you know my love is true
I just don't know what else to do
Chorus:
'Cause I'm not your savio, I can't part the sea
I ain't a genie, I got no tricks up my sleeve
I don't have the answers, I don't hold the key
But I'm all the woman that you,
That you'll ever need
If you're looking for a love, baby here I am
But I'm only human so please understand
I can't take back your bad times
Turn water into wine
Just what am I supposed to do
Chorus
I'm all of the woman that you'll ever need
I'll rock you gently when you're feeling weak
But honey it's not fair if you don't do your share
Who's gonna take care of me
Chorus
