Song:

(Why do they cut?)
You said you know what's right for them.
(Why can't they all just fall through tde ground?
Dashing, dashing, young and bold.)

And when you lie, you fail to know this line.
(Lie down, lie down, die.)

And then you will get away.
(Trash them, lie down.)

When will you let me fall?
(Watch out, you're not.)

So much more than, so much more than
(Lie down tonight.
(You're not worth it.)

And the night is different

(You're not worth it.)

(Burn alive, 'cause you couldn't save me.
As you were, as you were.
Burn alive, 'cause you couldn't save me.
As you were, as you were.)

When you went alone.
(You will testify.)

And who will show you this?
(You will testify.)

They'll break you?

(You can't pick this up?)

They'll break you?

It's time to think of why they think?

The lights, they're going home.

Get away with me.

When this goes to?

Don't go, just fight it.

(Not this time.)

Lights

(Burn alive, 'cause you couldn't save me.
As you were, as you were.)

Lights?

(Burn alive, 'cause you couldn't save me.
As you were, as you were.)

When you went alone?

(You will testify.)

And who will show you this?

They'll take you so far.

They'll take you so far.

I'm not letting you take this from the sun.
There is just one condition in which you?

(I'm going to exit your lair.)

One more?

(I'm going to exit your lair.)

To help your eyes.
Know you're nothing special.

(Why do they cut?)

You said?

(Dashing, dashing, young and bold.)
