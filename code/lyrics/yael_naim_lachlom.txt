Song:

I wanted wings
To the horizon meanwhile
I wanted to approach
The other side of the rainbow

Let him dream, human being
He needs to dream
Let him breathe, human being
Asking to breathe

I have sadness and suddenly
I want to sail on the water
I have magic and suddenly
I want to fly to the sky

I have time
To look and dream
Upon the day, the other day
And the day after tomorrow

I wanted to touch
Our bliss
I wanted to know
Where we came from

Let her laugh, human being
She needs to laugh
Let her see your heart
It wants to live
