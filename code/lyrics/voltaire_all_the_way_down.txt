Song:

The sun goes down while children listen
All the way down
Black as a crow is the space in which you
Leave me standing
All the way down.
If you'd seen the light of day
I'd hold you here tonight
And if you'd seen the light, we'd go
All the way down
Up there in space, you're looking down on us.
Looking all the way down
And if you fell to earth, they have a name
They call it, they say,
"All the way down."
If you burned your wings and fell into my arms
You know I wouldn't mind being
All the way down
I can't believe in Hell
But I've got to believe in Heaven
I wouldn't sleep at night not knowing
That you were somewhere better
If you burned your wings and fell into my arms
You know I wouldn't mind being
All the way down
All the way down
All the way down
