Song:

So scream you, out from behind the bitter ache
Well, you're hangin' on the memory, you need most
You still want love. Love's ugly, smooth and delicate
Not without affection, not alone
And instead of wishing that it would get better
Man you're seeing that you just get angrier
And it's good that I'm not angry
I just need to get over
I'm not angry, anymore
Cry when you cry, run when you run
Love when you love
Represent the ashes
That you leave behind
And instead of wishing that the road had shoulder
Man you're seeing that you're sinking over time
And you're blind
And it's good that I'm not angry
I just need to get over
I'm not angry
It's dragging me under
I'm not angry
I'm not angry it's never been enough
It gets inside and it tears you up
I'm not angry and I've never been above it
You see through me don't you
And it's good that I'm not angry
I just need to get over
I'm not angry
It's dragging me under
I'm not angry
And it's good that I'm not angry
I just need to get over
I'm not angry, anymore
