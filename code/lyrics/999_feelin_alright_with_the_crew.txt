Song:

Time out the boys are rarin' to go
Tonight it's gonna be a hell of a show
You think you've got something to prove
Just wait see who makes the first move
Your boots fit the occasion tonight
Tank up everything's going just right now

Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew

I've got my blood in my hair
And I want to smash you in the face so
What's the point in all this blood and confusion

Don't blink why this stupid battle
A curse it aggrivates the metal
Outburst ain't it ever gonna settle down next time
I'm gonna even the score
You find that they'll be back for more

Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew
Feelin' alright with the crew
