Song:

[Verse:]
Start the dance of mass destruction!
All the world is one dancehall
End of human evolution
Djs deaf - all exits are closed
Track by track, you have no choice
Blood rave chaos over the world
Last days, last race, twilight ages
Welcome all on blood rave show

Blood Rave, Blood Rave, Blood Rave dancers
Cyber blood - electric senses
Blood Rave, Blood Rave, burn your dancefloor
Dancing devils - Always hardcore

[Verse 2:]
Start "Religion" shakes the floor
Divide the nations more and more
"Money", "Lies" and "Policy"
Two face - one democracy
The final track is called the "War"
One more country dead and gone
Are you afraid? Don't care about!
Nuclear winter - big chill-out

Blood Rave, Blood Rave, Blood Rave dancers
Cyber blood - electric senses
Blood Rave, Blood Rave, burn your dancefloor
Dancing devils - Always hardcore

We are start in 2004
In 2005 we are still in da case
All for one! One for all!
Make some noise!

The world has changed!
The age of blood
Let's start the dance
We want some more
This soundtrack
For Judgment Day
We make it now
This all Blood Rave!
