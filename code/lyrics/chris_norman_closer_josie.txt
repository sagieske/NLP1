Song:

Chorus:
Closer, closer Josie
Girl I want to hold you
I remember the first time, 
That I ever told you
And I can still recall
The way I whispered to you
I said girl I want to be with you, 
So closer, closer Josie

You were not my first love, 
You won't be my last
When I wanted to touch you, 
You said I move too fast
Go out to a movie
To watch the late late show
When you whisper to me
I guess it's time to go

Chorus repeats to end
