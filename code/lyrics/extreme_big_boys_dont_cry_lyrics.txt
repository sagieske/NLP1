-------------------------
Whoever said that
Big boys don't cry
You say you never
Shed a tear
Well, listen
That's a lie
We're all
Defenseless
When it comes to pain
I said boys and girls
Alike
Yeah,
We're all the same
It's my party
I'll cry if I want to
Big boys don't cry
As if nothing
Seems to matter
Big boys don't cry
Then why do I
Big boys don't cry
Because nothing
In this world
Ever matters
Big boys don't cry
Hey, I'm not ashamed
To say a tear
Is in my eye
Because another tear
Will take it's place
Before I die
