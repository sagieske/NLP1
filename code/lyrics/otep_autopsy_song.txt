Song:

Open wide, look inside [x2]
At my autopsy

I feel like
A woman
I feel like
I care
I feel like
I shouldn't
I feel like a child
Of despair
I feel like
It's over
I feel like it's coming
After me
I feel like
It's closer
I feel like this is all I'll ever be
I feel like
A failure
I feel like a hungry
Parasite
I feel like
A razor
I feel like a prayer
Lost in flight
I feel like
I'm hopeless

I'm afraid I'm a slave, I'm weak and average [x2]

I feel like
A hammer
I feel like
A nail
I feel like
I'm guilty
I feel like the wrist that it impales
I feel like
A butcher
I feel like
I'm being decieved
I feel like a beautiful loser
I feel like all you sheep
Are laughing at me

Open wide, look inside, at my autopsy
My autopsy

I feel like a complete waste of time
I feel I'm
Transparent
I feel like I can't
Escape my mind
