Song:

Workers:
At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day, standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living.
At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the winder is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying!
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day!

[The foreman and workers, including Fantine, emerge.]

Foreman:
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread

Workers:
There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job

Foreman:
And in a bed!

Workers:
And we're counting our blessings!
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!
And the boss he never knows, the foreman is always on heat
If Fantine doesn't look out
Watch how she goes
She'll be out on the street

Workers:
At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord pay the shop
Keep on working as long as you're able
Keep on working till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs on the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!

Girl:
What have we here, little innocent sister?
Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!

[She grabs the letter from Fantine.]

"Dear Fantine you must send us more money...
Your child needs a doctor...
There's no time to lose! "

Fantine:
Give that letter to me
It is none of your business
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

[They fight over the letter. Valjean rushes over to break up the squabble.]

Foreman:
M. Madeline's here!

Valjean: (as M. Madeleine)
What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two apart?
This is a factory, not a circus!
Now come on ladies, settle down
I am the Mayor of this town
I run a business of repute

[To the foreman...]

Deal with this foreman,
And be as patient as you can---

Foreman:
Yes M. Madeline.
Now someone say how this began!

Girl:
At the end of the day she's the one who began it
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town
There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra
You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around
And the boss wouldn't like it!

Fantine:
Yes it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us leaving us flat
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?

Women:
At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one
While we're earning our daily bread
She's the one with her hands in the butter
You must send the s*** away
Or we're all gonna end in the gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!

Foreman:
I might have known the b***h could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night.

Girl:
She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men

Women:
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again

Workers:
You must sack her today
Sack the girl today!

Foreman [spoken]:
Right my girl!
On your way
