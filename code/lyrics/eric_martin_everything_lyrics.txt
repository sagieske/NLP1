Song:

My life's been sad and blue for, oh, so long
Each day seems like a life time all alone
Strange to think that you could be someone who
Is all alone and waiting for someone, too

Oh, how I've dreamed of love to call my own
To cherish me as I have never known
Should we meet I know my dreams would come true
And loneliness would fade away.
And we would laugh together just the way
That lovers do

And then when you'd hold me tight
Oh, I'd forget that way
I cried myself to sleep at night
No more heartaches from that moment on
We would live for tomorrow
All the sorrow would be gone

You're everything, you're everything
You're even more than I could ever dream
You hold the key to happiness
You're all I need, your love is everything to me

If love outlives eternity I know
That endlessly I'd follow where you go
Side by side each day we'd share something new

You'd look into my eyes and say
That we will stay together come what may
As lovers do

And then when you'd hold me tight
There's nowhere I would rather be
Than in your arms at night
Making precious memories for two
We would promise forever
And forever we'd be true

You're everything, you're everything
You are the sun, the very air I breathe
I've told a million stars
How I've loved you from the start
You're the song inside my heart

You're everything, you're everything
You'd show me all the joy that love could bring
My reason to be living, you're my destiny
Your love is everything to me

You're everything, you're everything
You are the sun, the very air I breathe
I've told a million stars
How I've loved you from the start
You're the song inside my heart
