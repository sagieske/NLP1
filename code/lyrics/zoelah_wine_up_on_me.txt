Song:

[Verse:]
I've been thinking 'bout you baby,
Boy you really drive me crazy, baby
Boy you really put it on me, freaky
I like [missing...] my body, and I like when you...

[Chorus:]
You're wining in a circle and jammin' on me baby
You're pushing it up further, and wine up on me
And you wock up in a circle, and work up on me baby
Keep working Mr. Worker, come wine up on me

Keep working it, keep working it, keep working it,
And wine up on me.
Keep working it, keep working it, keep working it,
And wine up on me.
Keep working it, keep working it, keep working it,
And wine up on me.

[Verse 2:]
Boy you're so intoxicating,
The way you're twisting and you're turning.
I can't control this feeling, no no
You got me rising to the ceiling, and I like it when you...

[Chorus:]

Baby, baby, I want you wine up on me
Baby, baby, I want you wine up on you
Baby, baby, I want you wine up on you

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I'm so tempted for your body
The way you touch me drives me crazy, no
I can't control the way I feel right now
You got me thinking 'bout you, feeling for you, wanting for you

[Chorus:]
