Song:

Baby, baby, here, look at me, yes, I know, I know
Maybe, maybe, it's not worth a damn
All the things we do to ourselves, we don't understand
But who can say what tomorrow will be, we'll see

All our tomorrows find their own ways
And hear the sound of a distant thunder fading away
Well, every lonely night we'll make our own brand of delight
And take all the comfort we may

Baby, baby, just look at me, yes, it shows how it shows
Nothing worked out but I thought it would
I could've done worst in a soul, I must have done good
But who can say what tomorrow will be, we'll see

All our tomorrows find their own ways
(Find their own ways)
And hear the sound of a distant thunder fading away
For every lonely night we'll make our own brand of delight
And take all the comfort we may

I found a love in the strangest place
And refuge from the cold of the night
In a stranger's face, your face

For every lonely night we'll make our own brand of delight
And take all the comfort we may

All our tomorrows find their own ways
(Find their own ways)
And hear the sound of a distant thunder fading away
For every lonely night, yeah, we'll make our own brand of delight
And take all the comfort we may
Take all this comfort we may

All our tomorrows find their own ways
All our tomorrows fading away
All our tomorrows find their own ways
