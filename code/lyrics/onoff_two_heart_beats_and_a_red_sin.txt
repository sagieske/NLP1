Song:

Shaking in red, in red, in red
To the edge of the dream's dream

Already, every time when I'm stifled to death after I give up again and again
My emotions that have no place to go wake me up
Your unblemished smile knows it's an existence
So distant that it's cruel

Even though the unhealable wound only eats away at my heart
Even now I can't completely hold back my thoughts (that dwell) (within) the darkness

Shaking in red, in red, in red
To the edge of the dream's dream
We met; destiny begins to turn
A secret that no one, no one knows about
I fall, I fall, I fall
I certainly can't return anymore, even if I let my sins pass
