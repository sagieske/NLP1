Chorus 1:

Everybody get up it's time to slam now
We got a real jam goin' down
Welcome to the Space Jam
Here's your chance, do your dance at the Space Jam
Alright....

Come on and slam, and welcome to the jam
Come on and slam, if you wanna jam

Hey you, watcha gonna do
Hey you, watcha gonna do
Hey you, watcha gonna do
Hey you, watcha gonna do
Party people in the house lets go
It's your boy "Jayski" a'ight so
Pass that thing and watch me flex
Behind my back, you know what's next
To the jam, all in your face
Wassup, just feel the bass
Drop it, rock it, down the room
Shake it, quake it, space kaboom...
Just work that body, work that body
Make sure you don't hurt nobody
Get wild and lose your mind
Take this thing into over-time
Hey dj, turn it up
Qcd, goin' burn it up
C'mon y'all get on the floor
So hey, let's go a'ight

(Repeat Chorus 1)

Chorus 2:

Wave your hands in the air if you feel fine
We're gonna take it into overtime
Welcome to the Space Jam
Here's your chance, do your dance at the Space Jam
Alright...

C'mon it's time to get hyped say "Hoop there it is"
C'mon all the fellas say "Hoop there it is"
C'mon one time for the ladies say "Hoop there it is"
Now all the fellas say "Hoop there it is"
C'mon and run, baby run
C'mon, C'mon, do it, run baby run
Yeah, you want a hoop... So shoot, baby shoot
C'mon and slam, and welcome to the jam
C'mon and slam, if you wanna jam
C'mon and slam, and welcome to the jam
C'mon and slam, if you wanna jam

Slam, Bam, Thank you ma'am
Get on the floor and jam
It's the qcd on the microphone
Girl you got me in the zone
C'mon, C'mon and start the game
Break it down, tell me your name
We the team, I'm the coach
Let's dance all night from coast to coast
Just slide, from left to right
Just slide, yourself the night
Qcd, drop the base
3-point-1 all in your face
Jam on it, let's have some fun
Jam on it, One on One
You run the hole and I run the "D"
So C'mon baby just jam for me

(Repeat Chorus 1)

(Repeat Chorus 2)

Hey ladies!

Y'all ready stop?
"NO!"
Y'all wanna know why?
"Why?"
Cuz it's a Slam Jam

Fellas
"Yah"
Y'all ready to stop
"NO!"
