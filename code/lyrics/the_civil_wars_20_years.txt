Lyrics need some adjusting:
There's a note underneath your front door
That I wrote 20 years ago
Yellow paper and a faded picture
And a secret in an envelope
There's no reasons, no excuses
There's no secondhand alibis
Just some black ink on some blue lines
And a shadow, you won't recognize
Ohh... Ohhh...
Whoa... Oohh
In the mean time I'll be waiting
For 20 years, and 20 more
I'll be prayin' for redemption
And your note underneath my door
And your note underneath my door
