Song:

Attract me till it hurts to concentrate
Distract me, stops me doin' work I hate
And just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair

(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Where's my moral parallel?

It takes me half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other s**
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Oh, he's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell, yeah
I think he'd wear me well
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
Now from the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
You're too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

Creative energy abused
And all my lyrics go unused
And when I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off, I fantasize

(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
So where's my moral parallel?

(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Although I've been here before
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well, yeah
(Amy, Amy, Amy)
Where's my moral parallel?
