Song:

I have never been a beautiful boy,
Never liked the sound of my own voice-
I wasn’t cool when I was in my teens.
I never slept but I did have dreams.
And as I step out in this big old world
Seven billion just trying to cope.
And every one of us some day will die but,
Today I never felt more alive

Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it.
Running through your bones?
Running through your bones.
Yeah you set my heart on fire.
And it’s all hard-wired to my bones.

I can count all the things I fear.
I close my eyes but they don’t disappear.
If there’s a God then there’s a guarantee.
But if there’s not it’s just you and me.

Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it.
Running through your bones?
Running through your bones.
Yeah you set my heart on fire.
And it’s all hard-wired to my bones.

So kiss me before the sun falls down.
Run before your legs give way.
Swallow it all till you drown.

Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it.
Running through your bones?
Running through your bones.
Yeah you set my heart on fire.
And it’s all hard-wired to my bones.
Running through your bones.
Yeah you set my heart on fire.
And it’s all hard-wired to my bones.
Running through my bones.
Running through my bones.
