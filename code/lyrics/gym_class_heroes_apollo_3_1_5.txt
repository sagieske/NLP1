Song:

I'll kill it, I don't give a f**k (Travis talking)

Traded in my hollow words for jelly-filled verbs
And 5 pound pronouns and predicate, this is Schlep's etiquette
For sloppy-fabled manners get ya napkins, Matty Duke kick the beat and I'm rappin
Top of the line, top of the world, top of the mornin to ya top dog
That's a top-notch tie ya got, tie it in a knot
Till ya eyeballs pop out, so you can actually see what an actual mc looks like
And if I had to pick and choose, I'd be the indecisive d**k in the votin booth, laughin at my options like
Stop the presser on the media, Schlep rock is leavin ya
Walk with prosthetic concoctions, I thought I told you
You just a toadstool while Mario with firepower stickin d**k to the princess, it's just senseless like that David and Goliath drama
Might as the slingin stone, you're basically defenseless
Anyway you wanted Schlep rocks, cocks obnoxious, it feels like a midget is chillin in my boxers

I'm Sorry (Travis talking)
