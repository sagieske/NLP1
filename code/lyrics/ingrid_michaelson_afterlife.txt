Song:

[Verse:]
When the world is breaking down around you
Taking everything that you know
What you didn't know 
Is that we can go forever if we want to we can live inside of a moment
The one that we own

[Pre-Chorus:]
You and me, we got this
You and me, we're beautiful, beautiful

[Chorus:]
We all
We all are gonna be alright
We got
We got 
We always got the fight in us
And we all
We all are gonna live tonight
Like there' s no tomorrow
'Cause we're the afterlife

[Verse 2:]
Living like your dying isn't living at all
Give me your cold hands, put 'em on my heart
Raise a glass to everyone
Who thinks they'll never make it through this life
To live a brand new start

[Pre-Chorus:]
You and me, we got this
You and me, we're beautiful, beautiful

[Chorus:]
We all
We all are gonna be alright
We got
We got
We always got the fight in us
And we all
We all are gonna live tonight
Like there' s no tomorrow
'Cause we're the afterlife
'Cause we're the afterlife
'Cause we're the afterlife
'Cause we're the afterlife

[Bridge:]
Every time I close my eyes
I hear your favorite song
Telling me not to run, not to worry anymore
I can hold on tight, to nothing better than the rest
So it's now and never more

[Chorus:] 
We all
We all are gonna be alright
We got
We got
We always got the fight in us
And we all
We all are gonna live tonight
Like there' s no tomorrow
'Cause we're the afterlife

We all
We all are gonna be alright
We got
We got
We always got the fight in us
And we all
We all are gonna live tonight
Like there' s no tomorrow
'Cause we're the afterlife
'Cause we're the afterlife
'Cause we're the afterlife

We all
We all are gonna be alright
We got
We got
We always got the fight in us
And we all
We all are gonna live tonight
Like there' s no tomorrow
'Cause we're the afterlife
