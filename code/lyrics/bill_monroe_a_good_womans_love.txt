Song:

I was a rover, on land and on sea
'til a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
'til a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Still a-roamin' I go home in the evening and she's waiting there
and I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
and when night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love
