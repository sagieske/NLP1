Song:

There's a cabin in a valley my grandpa built on your land
Your mountains are a canvas for the Maker's hand
Tonight I'm fishing Elk River if only in my mind
No, I haven't seen her banks in such a long, long time

I carry you in my heart
Your memory comes over me like the dark and

Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you like crazy
Like a sound of a siren song
Oh Carolina you callin' me home, callin' me home

Sometimes I grow weary from goin' all the time
I love to take a minute let you ease my mind
I'd love to see my mama, maybe go for a drive
But I gotta play the star in some little town again tonight

Don't get me wrong I love what I do
It's just another song about missing you

Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you like crazy
Kind of like a siren song
Oh Carolina you keep callin' me home, callin' me home
Callin' me home, callin' me home, yeah

Oh, oh, I'm almost home

Like a phone call from my baby
Sayin' honey I miss you, I miss you like crazy
Just like a sound of a siren song
Oh, Carolina, Carolina, Carolina keep callin me home, callin' me home
Callin' me home, callin' me home

Carolina, Carolina keep callin' me home
