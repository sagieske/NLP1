Song:

This, this a dark this is a place I can't escape would you leave me here
Lying in wait hanging like baits strangled by fate would you even care
This is my cure this is my life this is my Christ my crow of thorns
This is the way the way that I die, die and be reborn
Dying to touch you I need you I love you
To make me to mold me to break me again
I can't deny that I'm hurting inside as
I'm pulling you close you push me away
As I look just to find my existence and open my eyes
I can't breath as you push me aside
Now I feel that it's time to die as I realize how you let me believe in a lie
As I struggle with both hands and
I try to arise from the sadness inside of myself
I cannot breath I'm burning alive cause I've lived through a season in hell
Look, look at my face shaded in gray wasting away I'm almost gone
I can replace this empty space you left me all alone
Why can't you see me I'm hanging here bleeding
It's tortured and twisting my insides apart,
Laughing and crying as ever things dying in me
And it's breaking my heart
Save me now
I'm in the show of your love
Can you feel your life pass you by
Can you see the sun in the sky
Life is calling you again, again
Can you feel the end?
