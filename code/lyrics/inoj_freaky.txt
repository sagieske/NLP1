Song:

I get lonely when your not around
And I wish that you were herre wit me so you kan love me down
You kno I love your kompany, but my momma don't want you hanging wit me
So, until you get a place were we kan hang
I'm gunna be your telephone baby

Chorus:

So let me hear you moan
While were gettin freaky on tha phone(while we get freaky on tha phone)
Talk a lil dirty get it on
Now let me hear you moan
Ohhhhhh
So let me hear you moan
While we gettin freaky on tha phone(while we get freaky on your phone)
Talk a lil dirty get it on
Now let me here you moan

I kan tell when there's somethin ta hide
Kuz your werds sound shady
And then you start act'n shy
So if this aint a real good time
Or if somebody's on your other line(somebody's on your other line)
Ill kall you around 10 my friend
And were gunna let tha nite begin

Chrous:
So let me hear you moan
While were gettin freaky on tha phone(while we get freaky on tha phone)
Talk a lil dirty get it on
Now let me hear you moan
Ohhhhhh
So let me hear you moan
While we gettin freaky on tha phone(while we get freaky on your phone)
Talk a lil dirty get it on
Now let me here you moan

My man and I kno it's ya
I thought I told ya
But you kno I want you baby baby I'm your souljah
And I wunna be wit ya
And I wunna please ya
But moms is trip'n and she will not let me see ya
Thought she was gone
But no she still at home
So I'll kall you around 10 so baby we kan be alone

Get freaky on tha phone
Freaky on tha phone I'm gunna give it ta ya til you moan

When I'm in need of love'n baby(i kall you on tha phone)
Kuz I like ta hear you beg and scream'n and moan(its on)
When I'm in need of love'n baby(when I'm all alone)
I like ta hear you oh and moan(its on)
Well let me hear you moan
While we get it on
Let me hear you moan
While we get freaky on tha phone
