Wyclef talking:
Yo to my people doing time, Xzibit, Juvenile, y'all need to
Nature, Ja Rule, Reptile come on
Bring the heat.

Xzibit
Look, I'm inhumane livin' in this house of pain
Stuck with a thousand street hustlers
Down on they luck
Repeat felons caught up with the death I was sellin'
And for the past three months yo I can still hear my victims yellin'
But I can't listen to my conscience it's nonsense
If I didn't shoot I'd be the nigga in the suit in the box under the ground
Fox chased by the hound locked permanent frown Xzibit get down
By liftin' iron by the pound for the tough individual
Runnin' run his mouth throw some hands with the General
Walk one day in the shoes of a criminal
Death disease keep your luxuries to a minimal
I'm not talkin' about weed, jewels, & Bentleys
I'm talkin' about clean clothes, hot food, and Dentyne
See what I mean livin' with the scum of the earth
Hit with plenty of time to adjust to life on the inside
(Wyclef)

Juvenile
You got me fucked up I'm innocent
Look I ain't do this shit you don't want to hear my side
But you believin' that bitch
You makin' my nerves bad I need to smoke me a jo'
'cause I know y'all ain't even thinkin' 'bout lettin' me go
Where my lawyer, nigga told me Juv' I can't do nothin' for ya
Y'all go tell that to my mother & my father
But they gon' cus y'all so don't you even bother
You know that shit ain't right that bitch didn't see nothin'
'cause it was dark at night but I guess us blacks
Look the same to y'all passin' niggas around like a game of ball
This is my third felony plus my third strike
Man I ain't goin' home I got 25 to Life.


QU New York, you try to criticize me I criticize you
Been the same muthafucka since in high school
Any beat I she'd light to with crazy wattage
Blankin' out bought my first eight ball for eighty dollars
Learned who not to trust grew obnoxious
So niggas start to hate me same time the boys in blue watch us
Circlin' but they don't slow down take you to court
Think you seein' Judge Joe Brown they just actin'
Indy's throwin' Tyson back in another year
Fuckin' with a nigga's career I cock back at bust in the air
Give me space beats with plenty bass drink my Hennessey straight
'til I hurl out third world clout I'll take niggas hearts
And turn killers into girl scouts works of art
Picasso from the Hydro roller-slash-hustler CEO-slash-retired soldier


Ja Rule
Kill or be killed behind the wall 40 day short
Still the thought of murderer true to the sport
I bang with the best niggas them career criminals
Now I'm in with these youngins lookin' to feel me out
Hollerin' 'bout how they gon' hit on me now
Niggas is real wild bangin' before trial
New kicks new trial I don't give a fuck
I'm playin' the yard ox taped to my nuts
Ready to self destruct Lord I don't wanna die
But what powered your honor to hit me with 25
I know that real recognize every hustle
And die with these niggas in the struggle
Ya feel me

Reptile
Oh God shells loaded in the semi auto quoted
Unknown cat never voted picture me on the scene
Huntin' for greens like Mike Meyers trick or treatin' on Halloween
Mashed down in the fatigues servin' the fiends
Kill or be killed metal pipes under the sleeve
In the city slicker bust checks or puff cess
Ruffneck love liquor & act figures bloodsport on the streets
No gloves pullin' knives out the 'fridge handin' out cold cuts
Ugh streets real thug so recognize thug close yo' eyes thug
You 'bout to die thug!
Call the President I'm blowin' up ya residence
Spill acid on the corpse to clear the evidence
Protestors outside screamin' free Gotti
Guard your body SWAT teams is waitin' with the shotty


Wyclef: Y'all need to

REPEAT

For all my people doin' time keep your head up
Wyclef Jerry "Wonder" New Millenium new millenium come on
