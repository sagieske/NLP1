Song:

The iron horse will roll
More time in the saddle than on solid ground
The beast that feeds my soul
A lust for life you can't understand

Alright!

Onward we will ride
The glorious sound of the hammer down
Keep on keeping on
Ahead of the pack with the wind at my back
Cut the road like a knife
What else are you doing with your life?

Alright!

Saddle up and ride
I'm with you brother by your side

Absolution, live by the wheel
Chase the horizon, a triumph of will

Alright!

The beast shakes the ground
Bark of thunder, an unholy sound
Screaming into the wind
Not for the weak, we'll deafen the meek
Take your life in your hands
If I have to explain you would not understand

Alright!
