Song:

Asking too much of you
(Toy Caldwell)

If I ask you to tell me about the man
You been seen with most everyday

If I ask you to tell me
Why you're never at home
When I call you in the middle of the day

And when I ask you to tell me only the truth
That ain't asking too much of you

If I ask you to tell me
Why you got someone to keep the kids
That Saturday I was gone

And I ask you to tell me
Why that same Saturday night
It seems you forgot to come home

Chorus

All I'd like to know is if you still care
And I don't think the question
I'm asking is by no means unfair
If I ask you to tell me about the man
You been seen with most everyday

And if I ask you to tell me
Why you're never at home
When I call you in the middle of the day

When I ask you tell me only the truth
That ain't asking too much of you
