Song:

My head's in a jam
Can't take you off my mind
From the time we met
I've been beset by thoughts of you
And the more that I ignore this feeling
The more I find my self believin'
That I just have to see you again

I can't let you pass me by
I just can't let you go
But I know that I'm much too shy to let you know
Afraid that I might say the wrong words and displease you
Afraid for love to fade
Before it can come true

Like a child again
I'm out and lost for words
How does one define a crush combined with longing
Longing to possess you, oh so dearly
And I'm obsessed by you completely
I'll go mad if I can't have you

I can't let you pass me by
I just can't let you go
But I know that I'm much too shy to let you know
Afraid that I might say the wrong words and displease you
Afraid for love to fade
Before it can come true

I can't let you pass me by
I just can't let you go
Let me say the things and say words to let you know
I would rather say the awkward words than lose you
Or for love to fade
Before it can come true...
