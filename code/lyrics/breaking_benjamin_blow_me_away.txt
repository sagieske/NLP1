Song:

They fall in line
One at a time
Ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose
We've got to move
Steady your hand
(I am losing sight again)

[Bridge:]
Fire your gun,
It's time to run,
Blow me away.
(I will stay, in the mess I made)
After the fall,
We'll shake it off,
Show me the way.

[Chorus:]
Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,
I am the shadow on the wall,
I'll be the one to save us all.

There's nothing left,
So save your breath,
Lying in wait.
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown,
Nowhere to go,
Holding your fate.
(Loaded I will walk alone)

[Bridge:]
Fire your guns,
It's time to run,
Blow me away.
(I will stay, in the mess I made)
After the fall,
We'll shake it off,
Show me the way.

[Chorus:]
Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,
I am the shadow on the wall,
I'll be the one to save us all.

Wanting it back
(Don't make me mad!)

Back off! (held out for about 2 seconds)

(Die! (held out for approx. 5 seconds))

[Chorus:]
Only the strongest will survive,
Lead me to heaven when we die,
I am the shadow on the wall,
I'll be the one to save us all...

Save us all!
