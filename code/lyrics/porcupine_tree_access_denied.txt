Song:

Access denied
All of the smarter kids they stay inside
But out in the pouring rain
You're kicking me with that look of sheer disdain

The fat controller man
He doesn't understand he's my biggest fan
So I'll stay here on the floor
It's better to be ignored than to be adored

Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing

Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children (now)
And you do

Good morning lucky man
I hope you enjoyed your sojourn in Japan
It's such a perfect scene
Back here in Golders Green - cut...end of dream
