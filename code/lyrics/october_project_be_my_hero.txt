Song:

Sleep with the window open
Sleep till tomorrow
Be my hero
Be withoiut being lonely
Try to open
We try to open
Hoping for a hero
I want something
I want everything
I want nothing
Nothing else
I want someone
Not just anyone
Be my hero
Keep what is secret
Secret
We can believe it
Be my hero
I want something
I want everything
I want nothing
Nothing else
I want someone
Not just anyone
Be my hero
See how we measure feeling
>From a distance
See how we measure people
Into zero
I want something
I want everything
I want nothing
Nothing else
I want someone
Almost anyone
