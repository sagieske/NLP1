Song:

If you want it, take it
I should have said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under a spell
Like a deadly fear I am, babe
On the highway to hell

I only want to die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more

(Our love baby, oooh)
The thought on your body
I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up and pretend
Oh baby

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want it
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
Cause I can't resist it no more
