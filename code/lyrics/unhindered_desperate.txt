Song:

I want to see you move in power
To see your kingdom come

I want to see your love poured out
Let your will be done

I want the world to see
Your beauty let heaven come to earth

Awaken hearts, open up their eyes
Let 'em know that You're alive

I can feel it burning now
My heart is crying out

I'm desperate
For ever word You say
To know you more than I could ever imagine

I want to see you move in power
To see your kingdom come

I want to see your love poured out
Let your will be done

I want the world to see your beauty
Let heaven come to earth

Awaken hearts, open up their eyes
Let 'em know that You're alive

I can feel it stirring now
I can feel it burning now
My heart is crying out

I'm desperate
For ever word you say
To know you more then I could ever imagine

I'm over this
I'm tired of my old ways

I'm chasing after you
Reveal yourself to me
Reveal yourself to me Lord
'Cause I need You

I'm desperate
For every word you say
To know you more than I could ever imagine

I'm over this
I'm tired of my old ways

I'm chasing after you
Reveal yourself to me

I'm desperate
For everyword you say
To know you more then I can ever imagine
