Song:

Grab my face
As hard as it's funny to you
While I pretend
I'm your real dad
How is anne's cough today miss sheryl
I pretend to ask
A daughter who I bug
And can only stand to be around me for about 30 seconds
But whose picture I wear
In a pin inside my coat
So, who is this picture
That's you anne
You're not coming to my birthday
Oh, I know
