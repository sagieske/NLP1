Song:

Let go! Al you propha cool
People,
Drop ur mask evend ur
Seakhole!
Set ur blood flow in!
Moseon!
Turn from frozen to
Fluent
Take it off
You dropp a cool
Let go!
Hear the golden rule
Take of!
Al you drop the cool
Let go!

Ref:
We!
Live like we never die!
You die and never
Live live live
Cos you never
Give give give
If you gonna
Live live live
Then you gada rumble
You gada rumble
With us.

Yo people!
With faces lack of one
Thing ey!
Lack of feelin!
Se you lack of feelin ye you lack of feel and
I watch a smile crack
Ur face!
Let go! Let go,
Al you propah cool
You propah cool
People
People
Drop ur mask evend
Ur seakhole set ur blood flow in moseon
Turn from frozen to fluent
And...
