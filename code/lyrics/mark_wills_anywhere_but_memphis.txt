Song:

(Monty Criswell/Tony Martin/Mark Wills)

Called her from a pay phone down on Beale Street
On my way to Birmingham
Said she was tired of never seein' me
She needed more than a guitar man
As the lonesome notes filled the midnight sky
I wipe my tears and wish that I was

Anywhere but Memphis
Any other place would have made a difference
The way the blues pour out of the dives and bars
Ain't no place for a broken heart
She could've told me in Baton Rouge or Dallas
Anywhere but Memphis

Wish she could have worked up her courage
And let me down in Little Rock
Or even as far back as Phoenix
When I stop to call from that truck stop
And if telling me sooner was just too hard
She could've waited later to break my heart

Anywhere but Memphis
Any other place would have made a difference
The way the blues pour out of the dives and bars
Ain't no place for a broken heart
She could've told me in Baton Rouge or Dallas
Anywhere but Memphis

Where the blues pour out of the dives and bars
It ain't no place for a broken heart
She could've told me in Baton Rouge or Dallas
Anywhere but Memphis
