Song:

Do you, do you
Wanna bleed?
Do you, do you wanna
Live in vain?

It's only life
She's so afraid to kiss
An' so afraid to laugh
Is she runnin'
From her past?
It's only life
She's so afraid of love
Is so afraid of hate
What's she runnin'
From now??

Do you, do you
Wanna scream?
Do you, do you wanna face
The strange?
Do you, do you believe?
Are you, are you
Afraid of change?

It's only life
She's so afraid of this
And so afraid to ask
She hides behind her mask
Nothing's ever right
She's so afraid of pain
So afraid of blame
It's driving her insane

So insecure
There is no cure

Well she's so afraid
She's so afraid of death
She's so afraid
Afraid of life
The drama in her head
Getting louder
All the time
She's so afraid
Afraid to lose
Been so afraid of
Fame
Everyday she
Feels the same
It's driven her
Insane...
It's driven her...
It's drive...
It's...
Another broken
Pretty thing
