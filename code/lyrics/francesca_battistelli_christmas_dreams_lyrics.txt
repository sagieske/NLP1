Song:

I blow out the candles, unplug the tree
There's no one awake at midnight but me
I sit down the hall and amid the moon beams
My kids are tucked in, dreaming Christmas dreams
Days of such wonder, magic- filled nights, moments they'll look back on all
Of their life
So much time wide- eyed and holiday seas
Now their worn out, dreaming Christmas dreams
Chorus:
Dreams of cookies and cards, boxes and bows
Storefronts and stockings and days when it snows
With all of the secrets that this season keeps
It's a wonder at all that they fall asleep
I smile as I kiss them
Cause' under that tree
Are surprises that they're not expecting to see
We're just hours away from their giggles and screams
They'll be answers to all their Christmas dreams
Chorus: Dreams of tinsel and toys and Santa's workshop
Noises at night coming from the rooftop
With all of the secrets that this season keeps
It's a wonder at all that they fall asleep
The thought comes to mind that I may be the one
Who's most excited for what's yet to come
As I crawl in bed, I laugh cause' it seems
Guess never too old for Christmas Dreams
No, you're never too old, no, you're never too
Old for Christmas Dreams
