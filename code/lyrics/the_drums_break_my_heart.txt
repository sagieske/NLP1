Song:

[Chorus:]
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you

[Bridge:]
I'll sing the, melody, that you used to sing
I'll sing the, melody, that we used to sing

[Verse:]
Where did you go? You haven't even called
Oh, Where can I find the only one who can
Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

[Chorus:]
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you

[Bridge:]
I'll sing the, melody, that we used to sing
I'll sing the, melody, that you used to sing

[Verse 2:]
What is the point of living without you, oh, in my life
These days that feel like nights
Break my heart, break my heart
Break it and make it hurt
Break my heart, break my heart

[Chorus:]
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you
I'll sing it in my heart, while I wait for you
I wait for you

[Bridge:]
I'll sing the, melody, that we used to sing
I'll sing the, melody, that you used to sing

[Outro:]
I'll be waiting here, I'll be waiting here for you
