Same... Play... Mother f****are Hated...
Hated Misery So I Keep My Company Gone
Six Blondes, No Bras, Back In The...
... Get Served While...
Sick World Living In, Pissing In The World Pool
Last Dollars On This Coffee Table, But I'm Good!
Hands To The Sky, Praying Like Christ War
It's Hard To Level When All Of Us Follow Us From The Ghetto.
You Are Fellows, Getting...
Waking Up On God's Screams, Bloody On Your Knees
These... No Id,
These Hard Niggers Hide Their Pills Down...
My Heart Speaks Illustrated On A Beat,
If That Fails At Least I Live With Memories.
Judgely Days, My Only Day Of Death
So Mother f****are Don't You Test Me, n****are!

Chorus:
I Can't Roll In A...
You're A Real Hater I Can See It On Your Face!
You Don't Wanna Do That, Do That
Mother f****are, You Don't Wanna Do That!
No, Being A Hustle On My Life
I Wanna Go Right, Rolling As You Say Is The Only Way To Survive
So I Gotta Do That, Yeah I Gotta Do That!
Mother f****are, Let The Haters Say
Oh, Oh, Oh, Do That!
Do That, Let The Haters Say
Oh, Oh, Oh, Do That!

... Oh, How You Say You're Innocent, Illegitimate And Children
Ain't Gonna Hurt... Heart Resentment.
F**k On You, Middle Finger Never...
Only At The Lord's Gates Judging Me To Let Me In
It's Funny When These Federal Bills...
Since... Back Terms, No Friends
I'm Only Human Flys Down To...
... Body, Funerals And...
Body Eroded... Black Roses...
... A Quarter On My Arm,
Fifty Down, Keep The... Blinded By Your Charm!
Get Money Like I'm Jewish,
Cheat, But... My Girls, Into Your Style Like...
Head To Their... That's Why I'm Call It...
Mother f****are...

Chorus:
I Can't Roll In A...
You're A Real Hater I Can See It On Your Face!
You Don't Wanna Do That, Do That
Mother f****are, You Don't Wanna Do That!
No, Being A Hustle On My Life
I Wanna Go Right, Rolling As You Say Is The Only Way To Survive
So I Gotta Do That, Yeah I Gotta Do That!
Mother f****are, Let The Haters Say
Oh, Oh, Oh, Do That!
Do That, Let The Haters Say
Oh, Oh, Oh, Do That!
