Song:

Here I stand, all alone
Trying to fight the pain from a broken heart
Why she left me? I don't know
It really doesn't matter anymore
I thought our love could last forever
But here I stand lost and all alone

Start a new day, but not alone
I'm gonna break away this broken heart
I'll meet a woman. I'm gonna take her home
Where I'll pick up all the pieces and start all over again
I know that life will be much better
I know the sun will shine again.

Chorus:
There is life even after a brokeheart
You can fight
The pain from a broken heart, broken heart

(Guitar solo)

I know that life will be much better
I know the sun will shine again.

Chorus x2
There is life even after a brokeheart
You can fight
The pain from a broken heart, broken heart
