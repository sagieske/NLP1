Song:

We used to be alive
We used to be happy
These irrelevant thoughts
Keep running into my head

We used to be in peace
Now we're both weary
So tell me the truth
Are we falling out

Oh are we running for our lives
The truth is I want you now
Like I wanted you last time
Are we headed to the end of this line
Gone to the other side

This place is so serene
Swallowed by sadness
This picture is not
What I have been looking for

We've never been apart
And now you're drifting
Further away
Further away from me

Can you feel
Can you feel it
It's all coming back
It's all coming back to you

I used to think we're done
Back from beginning
