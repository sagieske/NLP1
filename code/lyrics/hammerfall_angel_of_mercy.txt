Song:

Thereґs never been any reason,
Or escape from the treason,
You just think Iґm a tide, far away...
I feel your flame and yuor anguish,
I know your plans and your last wish,
You just canґt face it another day...

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland,
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
Itґs the end, itґs the end.

Youґve stood along the lifeline,
Youґve played the fool for the last time,
You just want the joy and the peace...
Youґve heard all the laughter,
Youґve seen what your after,
You just want the rest and the sleep...

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland,
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
Itґs the end, itґs the end.

Angel of Mercy...
Angel of Mercy!

(solo)

You can hear the clockґs tick,
As you scheme for your last fix,
From a place you never will awake...
I hear you cry into the night,
I hear you die within my fright,
But now youґve saved your mistake...

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland,
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
Itґs the end, itґs the end.

Angel of Mercy...
Angel of Mercy!
