Song:

I? Spend a lot more time in the pouring rain without
An umbrella
Covering my head
And I? Stood up to that bully when he pushed and
Called me names
But I was too afraid
And I? A gone on and saw Elvis that night he came to
Town
But mama said I couldn?
And I? A went skinny dipping with Jenny Carson that
Time she dared me too
But I didn?

Oh I, I? Done a lot of things different

I wished I? A spent more time with my dad when he was
Alive
Now I don? Have the chance
I wish I had told my brother how much I loved him
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning when
My grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would? E listened when they said Boy,
You? E gonna wish you hadn?
But I wouldn?

Oh I, I? Done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn? Change a thing, even if they
Could
Oh but I would

There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should? E bought it, but I didn?
She wanted to paint our bedroom yellow and trim it
Blues and greens
But I wouldn? Let her, wouldn? A hurt nuthin&127; She loved
To be held and kissed
And touched but I didn? Do it
Not nearly enough
And if I? A known that dance was going to be our last
Dance
I? A asked that band to play on and on on and on

Oh I, I? Done a lot of things different

People say they wouldn? Change a thing, even if they
Could
Oh but I would
Oh whoa Oh I, I? Done a lot of things different
Oh I, I? Done a lot of things
I think we? All do a lot of things different
