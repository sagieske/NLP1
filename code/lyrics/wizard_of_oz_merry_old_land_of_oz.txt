Song:

Ha - ha - ha, Ho - ho - ho - And a couple of tra - la - las
That's how we laugh the day away, In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
Bzz - bzz - bzz, Chirp - chirp - chirp - And a couple of La - di - das
That's how the crickets crick all day, In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
We get up at twelve and start to work at one.
Take an hour for lunch and then at two we're done.
Jolly good fun!
Ha - ha - ha, Ho - ho - ho - And a couple of tra - la - las
That's how we laugh the day away, In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
Pat, pat here, Pat, pat there, and a couple of brand new straws.
That's how we keep you young and fair In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
Rub, rub here, Rub, rub there, Whether you're tin or brass
That's how we keep you in repair In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
We can make a dimple smile out of a frown.
Can you even dye my eyes to match my gown? Uh-huh!
Jolly Old town!
Clip, clip here, Clip, clip there, We give the roughest claws.
That certain air of savoir faire, In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
Ha - ha - ha - Ho - ho - ho - Ho - ho - ho - ho -
That's how we laugh the day away In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
Ha - ha - ha, Ho - ho - ho - Ha - ha - ha -ha - ha
That's how we laugh the day away, In the Merry Old Land of Oz!
