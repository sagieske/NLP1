Song:

How does it feel?
When you have it all?
How can you live?
With nothing at all?

Where do you run?
Where do you go?
When the holes in your truth
Are starting to show?

And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I can't get out of bed

How can you take?
Without giving back?
How does it work?
When it's really cracked?

How does it feel

And no wonder
Hearts and minds have been won
How does it feel
And I wonder
How it's all come undone

And the rain comes
And the world is on my head
Crave the sun
But I can't get out of bed

Want it You got it You're sorry You bought it You're sliding
Want it You got it You're sorry You bought it Can't hide it
Tell me who do you see
Cause you look a lot like me

How can you take?
Without giving back?
Who do you see?
Cause you look a lot like me
