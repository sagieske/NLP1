Song:

I wanna get drunk and pass out on the floor
Work myself into convulsions, beat my head against the door
I wanna cut my skin, cut it until I bleed
I wanna feel pain, it's the life that I lead

Abuse myself, I, I, I, I wanna abuse my body
Cut it deep, make it bleed
Throw my guts out on the floor
Cut my face until I, when I get knocked

I wanna die before I get old
Get f****d up, then die

I wanna die, die, die I wanna die
Kill me, m**********are
I never died before
Bury me under the floor

Stick me in the heart, I ain't got one anyway
Stick me in the a**, that's the best part of me
Because I don't care if I live or die
It just don't matter, kill me anyway

I wanna abuse myself, yea
Shoot me, stab me, cut my throat
Hit me with a f*****g axe, I just won't croak

Look me in the eyes and what do you see
Stab me in the eyes, you can piss on me
Kick me in the balls, I just don't care
Rip out my brains, pull my f*****g hair

Abuse me, kick me, cut me 'till I bleed
F**k me, kick me, s**t on me
I just don't care you see

Destroy me, I wanna destroy you

I wanna die, I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna die old, I wanna die young
I wanna be a scumfuc and I wanna die young
Don't wanna play in no f*****g 60's band

Kill me, rape me, do with me what you will
I'm gonna f**k a girl who doesn't take the pill
Maybe she'll have a little boy, or maybe a little girl
I really don't give a f**k, 'cause I'll be dead it's just another world

That's right, abuse me, kick me, cut me, stab me, axe me
Knife me, fork me, f**k me, suck me, beat me, f**k me
Blow me, eat me, stab me, abuse my body, abuse my body
