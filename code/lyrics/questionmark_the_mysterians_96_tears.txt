Song:

Too many teardrops for one heart to be cryin
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on
Youre way on top now since you left me
Youre always laughin way down at me
But watch out now, I'm gonna get there
W'ell be together for just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you way down here
And you'll start cryin ninety-six tears
Cry, cry

And when the sun comes up, I'll be on top
You'll be right down there, lookin up
And I might wave, come up here
But I don't see you wavin now
I'm way down here, wonderin how
I'm gonna get you but I know now
I'll just cry, cry, Ill just cry

Too many teardrops for one heart to be cryin
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on
Youre gonna cry ninety-six tears
Youre gonna cry ninety-six tears
Youre gonna cry, cry cry cry now
Youre gonna cry, cry, cry, cry
Ninety-six tears
C'mon and lemme hear you cry, now
Ninety-six tears, I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long
Uh-ninety-six tears, cry cry cry
C'mon baby, let me hear you cry now, all night long
Uh ninety-six tears, yeah c'mon now
Uh-ninety-six tears
