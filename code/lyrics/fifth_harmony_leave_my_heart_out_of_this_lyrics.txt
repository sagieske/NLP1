Song:

[Camila]
My heart is telling me that you were gonna change, but no
My heart is lying right to my face yeah

[Ally]
My heart is making up excuses for your ways, but I wish that
My heart knew when I should walk away, baby

[Dinah]
It let's me down, it helps me as I get back up off the ground
You're telling me that this is love, but I found
It wasn't really on my side
Now I think it's time

[All]
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinions to itself
I should just listen to my head, cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

[Normani]
I'm done feeling like a stranger to myself, so I know
I've got to put all of my feeling on a shelf, yeah

[Lauren]
It lets me down, and tells me as I get back up off the ground
You're telling me that this is love, but I found
It wasn't really on my side
Now I think it's time

[All]
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinions to itself
I should just listen to my head, cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

[Dinah]
Sometimes, I wish you'd just shut up and let me think "I've had enough"
I need to just make up my mind
So that's why

[Camila]
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinions to itself
I should just listen to my head, cause it's the one who knows what's best
It tells me (tells me) not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you

[All]
Oh but it's not thinking clearly
I wish that I could leave my (leave my, leave my, leave my, leave my) heart out of this
Leave my heart out of this

[Dinah]
Hey la la la leave my heart
La la la leave my heart no no
