Song:

Meet me where I live
Take me by the feet
Walk me out of here
Look into my eyes
Watching you from the corner of end

You
The only one who can change my life
And I
Could swear by the things that I wouldn't do
For the first time

Meet me where I live
In tiptoes, in tiptoes (Show me now)
I don't want nobody to hear me say (Hear you say)

Coz I
The only one who can change your life
And you
Could swear by the things that I wouldn't do
You know it
For the first time

I've done so many things that I wouldn't do before
It started just one night and
Now I want more and more
For the first time
