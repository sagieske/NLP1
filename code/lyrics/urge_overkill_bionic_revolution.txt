Song:

Free the children
Said free the children
I said free, free the children
Free the children

Oh I recall like it was yesterday
The future came within a dream
A crowd of people they didn't have much to say
What they said they didn't mean

They said Free the children
Said sweet little children
I said sweet, sweet little children
Free the children

Free little children
Sweet little children

Save us from the bionic revolution (Now hold on)
Save us from the bionic revolution (Save us from the what?)
Save us from the bionic revolution (Say bionic who?)
Save us from the bionic revolution (That's what I thought you said)

Sweet little children
Free little children

Owww

Free the children
