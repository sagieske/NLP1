Song:

[Chorus:]
Can't you see your love is all I need,
Without you I'm nothing so please don't ever leave.

[Verse One (Tiny):]
Baby, I think you should take the time alone,
To sort out your feelings and be sure you're not going wrong, no.
You see, I know you hear many things that make you cry,
But our love is too strong to be ruined by a lie.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse Two (Tamika):]
Now tell me how I could ever live without you,
I can't live without you,
If you left me now I don't know what I would do.
I've never known anyone who could love me like you do,
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you.

[Repeat Chorus]

I've never known anyone who could love me like you do,
You mean the world to me and I feel I mean as much to you.

[Repeat Chorus (x2)]

[Outro:]
[Tamika:] No I just can't live without you,
[All:] Can't live without your love,
So baby please don't leave.
[Tamika:] You should take some time to realise,
[All:] You're the only one I'm thinking of.
Baby please don't leave,
[Tamika:] Thought our love was too strong to fall,
I need you baby so please don't go.
