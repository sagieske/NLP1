Song:

I want to be your lover
But your friend is all I've stayed
I'm only halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away

I long for your lips to kiss my lips
But just when I think they may
You lead me halfway to paradise
So near, yet so far away, mmm

Bein close to you is almost heaven
But seein you can do just so much
It hurts me so to know your hearts a treasure
And that my heart is forbidden to touch, so

Put your sweet lips close to my lips
And tell me that's where they're gonna stay
Don't lead me halfway to paradise
Mmm, so near, yet so far away

Oh, uh, oh so near, yet so far away
Fade
Yeah, yeah so near, yet so far away
