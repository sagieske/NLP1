Song:

If I strum chords, would you sing a song with me
If I leave town would you leave along with me
We can fly away to outer space or
We can find a way to leave this place

We don't need a map and you can throw your phone away
We don't wanna hear the things we know they're gonna say
You don't trust yourself but girl trust in me
Don't look in the mirror the past you don't wanna see

What do you say we leave for California
If we drive all night we can make it by the morning
And no one has to know if we decide to go
What do you say we leave for California

If we leave our friends then we can be together
We can leave this town if only for the weather
I could drive and you could sleep
While the radio collides to the sound of our heartbeats

What do you say we leave for California
If we drive all night we can make it by the morning
And no one has to know if we decide to go
What do you say we leave for California

Hypnotized by the carbon monoxide
Would turning back be a good idea
Your cigarette after cigarette
Cannot help to calm your fear

But I'm still driving
Just keep sleeping
We'll keep moving
But I'm not leaving no I'm not leaving

What do you say we leave for California
If we drive all night we can make it by the morning
And no one has to know if we decide to go
Oh, What do you say we leave for California

What do you say we leave for California
If we drive all night we can make it by the morning
And no one has to know if we decide to go
Oh, What do you say we leave for California

What do you say we leave for California
If we drive all night we can make it by the morning
And no one has to know if we decide to go
Oh, What do you say we leave for California
