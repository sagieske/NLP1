Song:

It's over now, I can't compete
I don't know how I'm still standing on my feet
So turned around and incomplete
I'm not that happy woman that I used to be


Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a lie
But in your heart you know that truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through (Oh baby)


I never thought you'd turn you back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go


I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone


It's over now, we can't go on
In my eyes I thought that you could do no wrong
It's no surprise we both belong
Because of you my heart's singing us that song


Oh, please tell me what did you mean
When you said that you were mine, you knew that was a lie
But in your heart you know that truth
And I'm trying to forget
All the things you put me through (Oh baby)


I never thought you'd turn you back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go


I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone


I can't believe our love is over now
Where did love go
And why did I believe that we would be together forever
Now it's all a memory


I never thought you'd turn you back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go


I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone


I never thought you'd turn you back
And walk away from love like that
While I was holding on to you
All you did was let me go


I never thought I would regret
The way I felt when we first met
And now I'm standing here
Alone in this world, alone
