Song:

You're screaming out the orders
But you refuse to lend a hand
Then you run back to your fortress
It's a fragile castle made of sand
Like a sheep in wolf's clothing
Your barks far worse than your bite
A snake in the garden of eden
It's a shadow in the night

No future - Act the part
You lose right from the start
Play your role and play their game
Don't live your youth in vain.

So dry your bloodshot eyes
Of the bitter tears you wept
Is this the life that you want
Or the one that you accept
Your words all sound so scripted
And your playing another role
You'll Give a great performance
But you've got, no control

No future - Act the part
You lose right from the start
Play your role and play their game
Don't live your youth in vain.

When it's all been said and done
And all the smoke has cleared
Did you speak from the heart
Or was it what they wanted to hear
You act your part just like a puppet
You f*****g make me sick

No future - Act the part
You lose right from the start
Play your role and play their game
Don't live your youth in vain.
