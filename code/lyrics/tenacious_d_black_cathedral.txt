Song:

The pagan world will destroy Christianity,
From there where no trace only ashes of the cross.
And the Bible lines fall silently on the ground,
Covering with itself all steps of Black Cathedral.
Warriors come, get my spite to great is the enemy,
Every single one who is carrying faith in Jesus.
We will destroy... Here in the moon deeper in my eyes,
Hidden black cathedral. Here presages Black Cathedral...
Forces of Black Cathedral... Every night burns the flame...
Flame of christian churches. Warriors come, Death to Christianity...
Warriors come, calling souls... On the ground of Black Cathedral.
Warriors come, Falling souls.
