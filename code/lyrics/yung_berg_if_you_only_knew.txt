Song:

Berg, Casha, let's go

So many times, you and I
Makin' love through the night
The way that you make me feel
From the wrong to the right
All the pain, you and I
You know that I'm down for real

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The things that you can make me do

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The way that I feel for you

It goes fresher than whoever, shawty, yous a star
Must've fell straight from heaven, she then landed in my car
Standin' by the bar, conversation smart
Felt like my first time, hittin' 106th in park

Back hella arch, legs super thick, you know the type
That you can't wait to go and spread apart
Had her from the start, took it to the waist
Where her top came down for I threw it out of car

And still to this day, I hop up in a Coupe
Hear records on the radio like "I'll do anything for you"
So tell me what am I to do, I lost one life, Jay
So I let this song cry for you

Yeah, show canceled the first season
No Martin, no Gena, guess only did it for you, mami
I'm right here where you need to be
And when I lost you, I lost a piece of me

So many times, you and I
Makin' love through the night
The way that you make me feel
From the wrong to the right
All the pain, you and I
You know that I'm down for real

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The things that you can make me do

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The way that I feel for you

It goes ever since you left me
My pride won't let me dial up the phone, my pain is so heavy
Back seat action, need you off in the Chevy
Remember me I put you on the ice like reski

Wait let's see, how you gonna next me
Ma, I gave you everything minus the wedding ring
Remember that, yeah, but back then we was seventeen
And now I'm twenty two, you turnin' twenty three
(Go)

X said if you love something let it be
And if it never comes back it never was for you
Yeah, I'm sitting here like where my love's at
Helped me with the rap but didn't see me sign the contract for you

Yeah, now you see me on the screen
Close my eyes for a second still see me in my dreams for you
Mami, I'm right here where you need to be
And when I lost you I lost a piece of me

So many times, you and I
Makin' love through the night
The way that you make me feel
From the wrong to the right
All the pain, you and I
You know that I'm down for real

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The things that you can make me do

If you
(Only knew)
If you
(Only knew)
The way that I feel for you

If you only knew
(What I do)
For you
If you only knew
(How I feel)

If you only knew
(I'll do anything, boy, I'll do anything, boy, I'll do anything for you)
If you only knew
('Cause you drive me so crazy, girl)
Boy, I'll do anything for you

Ain't know what it is
Yb's still up, my girl, Casha
For real

If you only knew
If you only knew
The things that you can make me do, me do

And if you only knew
If you only knew
The way that I feel for you
Oh, hey, hey hey for you
Hey, hey hey for you
Hey, hey hey for you
