Song:

Her arms around a flag of blue
His clours flying black and white
She hears the voice between the lines
He hears the warning, he turns his black

Anybody's war
Who is there to catch the pieces
Anybody's war
Faces we don't recognise

She catches every last regret
She holds it gently like a dying star
He stands like a small boy in the street
Throwing rocks and stones into the crowd

Anybody's war
Who is there to catch the pieces
Anybody's war
Faces we don't recognise
Anybody's war
Turning round and round in circles
Anybody's war
People just like you and I

Just a little too afraid
To take the blame that they can't hide
Like a frightened child who is running scared
And they know each other well
Through the innocence long gone
Is the only thing they ever shared

She'll promise that she'll try again
He'll promise that he'll settle down
And they will call themselves the best of friends
But still they're strangers, just like anyone

Anybody's war
