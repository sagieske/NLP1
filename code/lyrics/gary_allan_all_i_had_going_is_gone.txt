Song:

The day we met
I'll never forget
Was the luckiest of my life
She took me so far
And I broke her heart
Now I'm sittin' here
With the simple truth
That tears me apart

Chorus:
All I had goin' is gone
The best I'll ever do
Is over and done
It serves me right
'Cause I did her wrong
Now all I had goin' is gone

Sometimes a man
Just don't understand
He possesses everything life can bring
He thinks there's more
So he has to explore
Leavin' her alone
Time after time
Til she wlaked out my door

Now it serves me right
She left me alone
Now all I had goin' is gone
