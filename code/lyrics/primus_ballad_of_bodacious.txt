Song:

Bodacious am a whole lotta' bull
Over nineteen hundred pounds.
He's born in Dodger, Oklahoma
And he's the baddest sonsabitch around
If a Burma bull ever were a super star
Then Bodacious just might be.
He's a cream colored, beefy brawn,
Full-fledged, four footed bovine celebrity.

Who's gonna ride Bodacious?
Who's gonna tame him down?
Look out for Bodacious,
He's bound to hold his ground.
Here comes Bodacious,
Ya'll just step aside.
Big and bad Bodacious
Takes a toll from those who ride.

Young Bo met a man named Tuff Hedeman
At the start of his buckin' spree
And Tuff became one of the few to make the whistle
Bkac in Nineteen Ninety Three.

Tuff tried to ride Bo again at the finals
In Nineteen Ninety Five.
Bodacious had got a little older and wiser
Tuff barely came out alive.
