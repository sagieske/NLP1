Song:

Is it hard to believe I'm ok
After all it's been awhile since u walked away
I'm way past crying
Over you finding someone else

You turned my days into nights
But now I see the light
And this maybe the big surprise to you

Chorus:
But/coz uve made me stronger by breaking my heart
You ended my life and made a better one start
You've taught me everything from falling in love
To letting go of a lie
Yes you've made me stronger, baby, by saying goodbye

If you try to believe I'm not over you
Go ahead, there's nothing wrong with making beleive
I know, coz I used to pretend you'll come back to me

But time has been such a good friend
Brought me to my senses again
And I have u to thank
For setting me free

Rep chorus

Think again
Don't feel sorry for me, my friend
Ooohh... don't u know, I'm not the one of the losing end **

Rep chorus 2x

You've made me stronger, baby, by saying goodbye
