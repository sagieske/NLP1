Song:

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
Rays of hope that hypnotise
They're a blessing in disguise
Lightning up my life

We can play
In our secret hideaway
We can go there everyday
Time is on our side

Chorus: She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
There will be no compromise
Now that I have realised
What they mean to me
Oh year...

Chorus:
She blinded me...

She brought heaven to me
Just like a symphony
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world

I'm not a superstitious mind
Not the spiritual kind
But she became a revalation to me
She made me believe

Outro:
She's the sun that makes the rainbow
She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
She's the thunder, she's the lightning
She's the weather that keeps blowing troughout time
