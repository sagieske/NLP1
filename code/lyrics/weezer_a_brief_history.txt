Song:

Wooly Mammoth's my favorite mammal
And he's got more sperm than a sperm whale
The Bible says that God made the stars
But Darwin makes more sense to fish
On Mars

Falling in deep into a deep black hole
Falling in deep into a deep black hole
Falling in deep into a deep black hole
And the whole is so black

He's more man, I feel stupid
'Cause I have got brains absolutness
Mountain joy tips on top she'll age much faster
That's the paradox
Arrow of timepoints in the direction
To be built in one two
Has been, wanna go to Has been
Wanna go to Has been
