Song:

You and I, an unmatched pair
Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet

Not perfect yet but close enough for love

How old-fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day

When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always

Always long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

Not perfect yet but close enough for love
