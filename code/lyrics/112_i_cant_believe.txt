Both:
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away (I can't believe you're gone
Away)
All those days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt soooo bad
A broken heart
Was never meant for me
Faith:
Lord let it please rain on my face
So that it can wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
'cause I don't wanna be
Hurt like this again
I can't believe
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(I can't believe)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(gone away gone away)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(no no)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe your gone away)
112:
Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind then things could have changed
I'll give anything
To be with you again
Faith:
All I ever wanted was to see your face
And here your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you're gone I have no reason
For feeling that way
I can't believe you're gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(ooooh nooo)
I can't believe that love has gone away(and it hurts so bad)
(I can't believe I can't believe)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(oh why did you go oooh?)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe your gone away)
112:
(When I) When I look back on the times we shared
And my love was so good
No one else could compare
Faith:
(Don't you know) Don't you know you were my love (my only love) and I
Can't believe (I can't believe) that you're gone away.
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(away... I can't believe)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(no I can't believe)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(girl I can't believe oh...) (how could you leave me baby? Yeah...)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you're gone away)(oooh)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(that you're gone away from me)
I can't believe that love has gone away (that you're gone)
(no I can't believe)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(come back baby) (yeaaah)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(ooooooooh)
(I can't believe you're gone away)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(Baby I love you)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(Thinking about you all the time) (Tell me why did you leave?)
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
(no no no no no)
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you're gone away)
