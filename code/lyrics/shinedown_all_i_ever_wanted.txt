Song:

Lie here alone and wonder why
That I come alive, just before I have to hide.

[Pre Chorus]
Because I believe I'm losing my nerve
But could I ever do better than this

[Chorus:]
Because all I ever wanted was a place to call my home
To shelter me when I am there and to miss me when I'm gone
All I ever wanted was a place to call my own
Where stars may dance and sun still shines and the storms feel free to roam

I listen if only for a while
But I can't decide if I'm aware that I'm on trial

[Pre Chorus]

[2nd Chorus]

[Bridge:]
If there's a way to a remedy then lead me straight to it
If there's a path or a door I missed, then show me now, show me this

[Chorus:]

Feel free when I am gone
