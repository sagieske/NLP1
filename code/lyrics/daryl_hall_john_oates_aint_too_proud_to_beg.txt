Song:

Aint too proud to beg

I know ya wanna leave me, but I refuse to let you go

If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy,

I don't mind coz you mean that much to me

Aint too proud to beg, you know it (sweet darlin)

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Now I heard a cryin man, is half a man

With no sense of pride

But if I have to cry to keep ya, I don't mind weepin

If itll keep you by my side

Aint too proud to beg, you know it sweet darlin

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day just to keep you from walkin away let your friends laugh, even this I can stand cause I want to keep you any way I can

Aint too proud to beg, you know it sweet darlin

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Now I've gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart

And each day it grows more and more I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you baby

If pleadin keeps you from walkin out that door

Aint too proud to beg, you know it sweet darlin

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Aint to proud to plead, baby, baby

Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Baby - baby - baby
