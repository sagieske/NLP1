Song:

The sky's on fire
Lightning in the sky
Tried to tell you, I'm tempted, do I? Yeah.
And we've been praying for the raining
It's been months now since it came here in California
I'll be here to hold ya

Bet on it
Bet on it
They don't mind what the talkers all say
I'mm be around forever, always you can bet on it

The sky's on fire
Lightning in the sky
And you know that I Tried to tell you, I'm tempted, do I? Yeah.
And we've been praying, anticipating, been to hold ya
I'm coming for the road that we have for life
I'll be here tomorrow

Bet on it
Bet on it
They don't mind what the talkers all say
I'mm be around forever, always you can bet on it

Fire

Always win the wind
Trippin' on the pack, you're next
And we're gonna have it again
And you're gonna wonder when is it to show again
When you're sick about the past
But past is the only system to beat about to come
Let the mourn and malest
Ain't no stopping we're by the cosmical
