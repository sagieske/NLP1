(Gary Moore)

I don't know what is wrong with you.
Baby, baby, whatcha tryin' to do to me?
Hm.
Lovin' you has got me so confused,
I'm sick and tired of always bein' abused this way.

All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
Every day and every night.
All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
It's gonna make me feel allright.
Yeah.

I don't know what's on your mind.
Baby, baby, why're you so unkind to me?
Yeah.
Lovin' you is driving me insane.
Baby, baby, I'm in so much pain and misery.
You know why.

All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
Every day and every night.
All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
It's gonna make me feel allright.

I just want some of your lovin'.
Some of your love.

All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
Every day and every night.
All I want from you is your sweet lovin',
It's gonna make me feel allright.
Yeah.

I say just give me some of your lovin'.
Just give me some of your lovin'.
Wow, yeah.
Some of your love.
