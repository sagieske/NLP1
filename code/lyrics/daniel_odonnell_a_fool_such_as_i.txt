Song:

Pardon me, if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me, should I cry
I'm a fool but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I.

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool but I love you dear, I'll miss you till I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I.

--- Instrumental ---

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool but I love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I.

Now and then there's a fool such as I...
