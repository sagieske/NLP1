Song:

I saw you walk down the street
With some other girl
Yeah
Always thought that I was the only one in your world
Baby can you tell me so
Out of sight out of mind ain't what love ought to be
Yeah
And I hoped all the time that you'd be faithful to me
You'd be faithful to me

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
I just want to be sure
That forever and more
You would be my baby

Love is just like a flower baby it has to grow
Yeah
And when you are away I'm even loving you more
I just have to let you know
One on one is the way and that's the way it should be
Yeah
So if you're not gonna stay
The don't be playing with me
You can set me free

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause all this love is for you
And you know that I'm true
And I'll be your baby

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause you knew from the start
That you were working my heart
Won't you be my baby

Ooo-ooo-oo-oo
Ooo-ooo-oo-oo
Alright, alright

I remember our walk the other Saturday night
Yeah
Sweet harmonies filled and floated through our minds
Never felt this way before
We were riding so high on loving and understanding
Yeah
So why go wasting your time when you have got such a find
That is everlasting

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
I just want to be sure
That forever and more
You would be my baby

All I'm asking you for when you walk out the door
Is to be my baby, baby
'Cause all this love is for you and you know
That I'm true
And I'll be your baby
And I want you to love me baby.

Ooo-ooo-oo-oo
Ooo-ooo-oo-oo
Alright, alright.
