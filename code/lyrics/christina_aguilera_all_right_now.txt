( A. Fraser / P. Rodgers)


There she stood in the street
Smiling from her head to her feet
I said hey what is this
Now maybe baby
Maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said Hey, what's your name babe
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate!

All right now
Baby it's all right now
All right now
Baby it's all right now

I took her home to my place
Watching every move on her face
She said look what's your game
Are you trying to put me in shame
I said slow don't talk so fast
Don't you think that love can last
She said love Lord above
Why you tryin' to trick me in love

All right now
Baby it's all right now
All right now
Baby it's all right now

All right now
Baby it's all right now
All right now
Baby it's all right now
