Song:

Come on children, let's sing
About the goodness of the Lord
Come on children, let's shout
All about God's great (rich) reward
Guide our footsteps everyday
Keeps us in this narrow way
Come on children let sing
(Come on children, let's shout)
(How the Lord Almighty)
(Has brought us out)
(There's none like him)
(Without a doubt)
Come on children, let's sing
About the goodness of the Lord

He has been my all an' all
He will never let me fall
That is why I can sing
That is why I can shout
Because I know what it's all about
The goodness, goodness
Of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord
(repeat chorus)
