Song:

I miss you when the morning's been up all night
Delicately whisper I'll be alright
Maybe someone else will bring a passion out of you
That I never saw, I am torn apart

I miss you in the moments when it all stops
Listen to the silence that hurts my heart
Maybe someday we will meet again and I'll turn back
Now our love turns to black

So I write this letter that I'll never send
Just so I remember the beauty of the end
And I write this letter to my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever, the beauty of the end
Falling never hurts, the landing does

I miss you when I'm laughing, you're very near
But then I open up my eyes, and you're not here
Maybe one day you will understand that I had to
I did it all for you

So I write this letter that I'll never send
Just so I remember the beauty of the end
And I write this letter to my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever, the beauty of the end
Falling never hurts, the landing does

And I'm just as scared as you are about this freedom
But I need to run with the wind
And I know right now you think there is no reason
But you'll see, please trust me, nothing in life is easy

So I write this letter that I'll never send
So I write this letter that I'll never send
Just so I remember the beauty of the end
And I write this letter to my long lost friend
So it stays with me forever, the beauty of the end
Falling never hurts
Falling never hurts
Falling never hurts, the landing does
