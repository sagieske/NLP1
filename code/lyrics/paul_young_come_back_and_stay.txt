Song:

Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize that you're here with me
Will you ever return
I won't be satisfied till you're be my side
Don't wait any longer
(Come back)

Chorus:
Why don't you come back, please hurry
Why don't you come back, please hurry
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

When you said goodbye
I was trying to hide what I felt inside
Until it passed me by
You said you'd return
You said that you'd be mine till the end of time
Well don't wait any longer

Chorus

Oh since you've been gone
Opened my eyes and I realized what we had together
Will you ever return
Or have you changed my mind
If you wanna stay mine just love me forever
Love me forever

Chorus
