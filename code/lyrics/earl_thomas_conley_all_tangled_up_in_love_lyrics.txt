Song:

All tangled up in love
Writers Bob Mcdill, Jim Weatherly
Duet with gus hardin

You were the heartbreak kind
Out for a one night stand
And me I'd been hurt
And I needed some help to forget
We didn't want any lasting thing
Just someone to hold till the morning came
We said there'd be no looking back
No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love
You were the goodbye kind
Footloose and fancy free
And me I'd made up my mind
Love was too hard on me
We planned to stay just one night
Then walk away in the morning light
Oh we said there'd be no looking back
No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love
Oh you and me didn't plan it this way
Something went wrong in the night
Now maybe we're not free anymore
But what can we do when it feels so right
We said there'd be no looking back
No ties that bind
No strings attached
But oh how we changed when the sun came up
Look at the two of us
All tangled up in love
