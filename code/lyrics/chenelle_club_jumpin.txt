Song:

There's another great one! 
Livin' a life of a crazy
Superstar
Chillin' out lookin' fresh at
The bar
Partyin' all night drinkin' all
Night
Chuun Chuun! 

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin and the club be jumpin'

And
Tipsy tipsy how I'm bout' to get
Chillin', dancin' but no
Cigarettes
It's cool that I don't like
Smokin' that
Come and drink that's all I
Need and lemme tell you
Girls and boys see chenelle
On the run
Makin' noise won't stop till
I'm done
What I do is my decision
I'm like a physical sinical
Dover
Yeah I'm the style

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin' and the club be jumpin'

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin' and the club be
Jumpin'

Turn the lights on and I
Hear my name called out
Once again the mike is
Passed to me and I'm
Like "what? "
Mc's be pushin' and sayin'
Go give it a shot
There I go again
Singin' till the nights out
Feelin' the rhythm in and
Dreaming like I'm hypnotized
Even if it's the kind of
Feeling is that nothing I
Can't describe
Rolling round, drinkin' and
Jumpin'
Till I'm bout' to pop
When the night is over
Somebody call me a cab! 

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin' and the club be
Jumpin'

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin' and the club be jumpin'

I'm wildin' wildin'
Walkin' stylin' stlin'
Yeah talk yeah talk to your
Friend lil' patient

I'm wildin' wildin'
Walkin' stylin' stylin'
Yeah talk yeah talk to your
Friend
A lil patient

[Chorus:]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the
Club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we
Movin' and the club be jumpin'

Hey eh! 
Have you saw
Checkin' out my makeup
And my tight jeans on
Walkin' round the club I'm a... 
Rough... 
Shawty now... 
Chenelle... 
Hurry up

On the floor
Lookin' so twist up
Like the worlds no. 1
I'll be the next
Hot... 
Gossip... 
I'm strutin' like
Hush! 

[Chorus: x4]
Hey eh! 
Party pumpin'
I count to three and the club be jumpin'
Hey eh! 
Groovy groovy yes yes we movin and the club be jumpin'
