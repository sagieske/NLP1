Song:

(The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm)

The rhythm of legs moving in the sun
The rhythm of an engine deep and throating
The rhythm of a summer that you walked in

The sound of a barking dog on a loop
A plane rises in crystal blue
The rhythm of keys swinging in your hand
The rhythm of light coming out of your fingers

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Heaven heaven

The rhythm of wheels, the rhythm of heels
That we fall into the sun
She walk on silver, she walk on gold
Paints "I love you" on the alley walls
For the eyes that hide behind black glasses
Sunlight hits everyone she passes

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Heaven heaven

And I don't know if I love you more
Than the way you used to love me
And I don't know if I need you more
Than the way you used to need me but it's

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Heaven heaven
