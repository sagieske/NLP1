Music & lyrics: mitch harris

Sympathise - simplify - magnify - to divide.
Isolate - zero in - intensify - to divide.

All intensive purposes.
All intensive purposes.

Pacify - dominate - fabricate - co-exist.
Animate - motivate - instigate - to divide.

All intensive purposes.
All intensive purposes.

A functional virus - sent in asylum.
Sever relationships - independently.
Isolate the problem - with persuasion.
Another setback - to live a life condemned.
Eyes upon one and we are bombarded.
Perseverance - or persevere awayance.
(life) the veil of secrecy - set the example.
Declare significance - a voice that disagrees.
