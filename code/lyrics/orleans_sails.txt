Song:

Sails are just like wings, you can fly from things
Run before the wind, Lord, let it blow
Let it rock me slow while I sleep below
Dreaming dreams that only sailors know

And it will soothe your mind, smooth away your lives
Set your clock back on your own time
If you sail with me, we will find the sea
We will find our love over again
