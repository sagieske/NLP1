Song:

Can't believe, you wanna leave, me so cold.
All I really, wanted was, to be with you, baby.
I can't imagine ever living life without you,
I'll do anything for you.

Chorus:
Cause I'm all turned out, I don't know what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.
Girl, you're driving me crazy, and can't see you baby,
You can't leave me alone. I'll do anything for you.
Anything for you.

But there is, nothing I, would not do.
I'd travel across the seven seas, to be with you, baby.
Just believe, that I can make your wishes come true.
Cause I'll do anything for you.

Cause I'm all turned out, I don't what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.
Girl, you're driving me crazy, and can't see you baby,
You can't leave me alone. I'll do anything for you.
Anything for you.

So many times I wonder, just how love could be so,
Good to me, all I that I know, is when it comes to you,
There are no limits, nothing that I won't do for you.
(Wish somebody'd tell me, Girl, you're driving me crazy,)
(And can't see you baby. Girl, I'll do anything for you.)
(Anything for you.)

Cause I'm all turned out, I don't know what to do.
I feel so down and out, wish somebody'd tell me,
Hurry up and tell me, what love is all about.
Girl, you're driving me crazy, and can't see you baby,
You can't leave me alone. I'll do anything for you.
Anything for you.
