Song:

People walking
People running
People waiting
On a second coming
Believe you me... I do believe 2x

People laughing
People starving
People divide
'Cause the people crowding
Believe you me... I do believe 2x

And I don't want to say no more today
Oh ho I don't want to hear no more today
Oh hey hey hey I don't want to say no more oh ho

Oh come on
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Come on
Whoa

Oh I do believe... I feel it
I do believe... I feel it
I feel it 30x
Yeah
Yeh ha
Come on boys
Oh ho oh 3x
It don't matter what yeah
It only matters when the time has come yeah yeah yeah
To believe 4x
