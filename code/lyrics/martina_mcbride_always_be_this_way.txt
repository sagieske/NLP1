Song:

I like the way you make my heart beat faster
You got me feeling like a sweet disaster
Ooo, and I like it
You like the way I say "I'm crazy about you"
You love the way it makes your heart go boom boom boom
Ooo, yeah you know you like it

It just gets better every day
Tell me forever that we'll always be this way
This is how we'll always stay
You'll still be kissing me the way you
You'll still be loving me and I'll be loving you
Please stay, we'll always be this way yeah

Everybody says we'll never make it
But they don't have a clue what they're sayin'
Ooo, they're just stupid, so stupid
We got our promises that can't be broken
We'll keep on lovin' with our hearts wide open
Ooo, yeah yeah

It just gets better every day
Tell me forever that we'll always be this way
And this is how we'll always stay ooh
You'll still be kissing me the way you
You'll still be loving me and I'll be loving you
Please stay, we'll always be this way

We'll always be this way
And this is how we'll always stay ooh
You'll still be kissing me the way you
You'll still be loving me and I'll be loving you
Please stay, we'll always be this way yeah yeah

I'm loving you, you're loving me baby, baby
Ooo ooh ooh yeah
