Song:

I wish you were a beer
Then I could drink you up
I wish you were not here
With my come in your mouth
I wish you weren't so q****
Your chains still lock me up

Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored
Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored

I wish you were a beer
The thirsty wanna drink
You wish I wasn't here
You're scared because I think
You wish I wasn't here
'Cause I'm your missing link

Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored
Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored

I wish you were a beer
Then I could drink you up
You wish I wasn't here
'Cause I can beat you up
I wish you weren't a q****
With my come in your mouth

Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored
Since when were you our lord
We're all so very bored
