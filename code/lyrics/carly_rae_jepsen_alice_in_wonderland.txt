Song:

Boy I like you,
Kinda much more than like you
And I'm really really really gonna try to
Keep it tucked beneath my tongue
You taste like chocolate
Put me in your pocket
And I wanna get your picture in my locket
Keep you tucked beneath my shirt, Oh
Something here, you got to see
Come fill my curiosity

I'm Alice in wonderland
Love is calling,
I know why they call it falling
Baby take my hand,
Don't be stalling,
I know why they call it falling

I waited,
'Cause love was overrated
But you never ever ever really dated
Got me working for your love,
What a turn on.
Trying to get my flirt on
Just wait until you see me with a skirt on
Would you like to catch a movie sometime?
Everything I thought I knew,
Keeps changing when I look at you

I'm Alice in wonderland
Love is calling,
I know why they call it falling
Tell me you understand
Don't be stalling,
I know why they call it falling

You're leaving me with
Left over smiles
And I'm starting to believe that
That it's been awhile
I've going young
Back into a time

Back into a time

Alice in wonderland
Love is calling,
I know why they call it falling
Tell me you understand
Don't be stalling,
I know why they call it falling

I'm Alice in Wonderland
And love is calling
I know why they call it falling
Baby come take my hand
Don't be stalling,
I know why they call it falling

Oh, I know why they call it falling (x3)
