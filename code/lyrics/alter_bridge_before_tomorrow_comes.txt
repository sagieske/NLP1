Song:

I couldn't sleep I had to listen
To a conscience knowing so well
That nothing comes form indifference
I look inside of myself

Will I find some kind of conviction?
Will I bid the hero farewell?
Will I be defined by things that could have been?
I guess time will only tell
I guess time will only tell

[Chorus:]
So don't let it be
Before tomorrow comes
Before you turn away
Take the hand in need
Before tomorrow comes
You could change everything

I curse my worth and every comfort
That blinded me for way too long
Damn it all I'll make a difference from now on
'Cause I'm wide awake to it all
'Cause I'm wide awake to it all

[Chorus:]

Does anyone care it ain't right what we're doing?
Does anyone care it ain't right where we're going?
Does anyone dare justify how we're living?
Does anyone here care at all?

[Chorus:]

We could be so much more than we are
We could be so much more than we are
We could be so much more than we are
Oh this much I know
