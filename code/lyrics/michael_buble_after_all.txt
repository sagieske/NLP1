Song:

Way back when we started
There was a part of me that knew.
One day you’ll be hiding
And I would lose myself to you.

And I walked all night
Lost in the silent city lights.
Thinking of you, wondering where I lose my mind.

After all I’ve decided
That to live my life again.
After all I’m delighted to be back where we began.
I believe that you can fall in love with me again
And we’ll both be standing tall, after all.

Way back when we started
There was a part of you that knew
I was all that you wanted, 
But only shadows filled the room.

I was lost, alright, 
Lost in the sleepless empty nights.
Dreaming of you, and in those dreams you were still mine.

After all, we’re united, 
Yeah, you’re in my arms again.
After all, I’m delighted
Cause the love was there a friend.
I believe that I can fall in love with you again
And I’ll catch your any fall, after all.

I was lost, alright, 
Lost in the sleepless empty nights, 
Dreaming of you, and in those dreams you were still mine.

After all I’ve decided
That to live my life again.
After all I’m delighted to be back where we began.
I believe that you can fall in love with me again
Cause I’m with you, I’ll catch you when you fall.

Reunited and we made it, after all
And we’ll both be standing tall, after all
After all, babe, oh, 
After all, after all, after all.
