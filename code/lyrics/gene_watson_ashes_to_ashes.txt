Song:

Your memory is something that
I never could seem to lose
Oh, I've tried everything even
Drowning your memory in booze
So I finally decided to lay down
And die with the pain
Oh, but my heart kept on beating
And softly repeating your name

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
My heart and my mind know
You're still here with us
(spoken) When they lay me away
The last words they'll speak
Here lies a man that don't rest in peace

God gave me your love and
God knows I threw it away
Oh, what I put you through
Is the same Hell I'm living today
Now praying don't help
So dyin's the best I can do
But when it's all said and done
I'll still have these memories of you

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
My heart and my mind know
You're still here with us
(spoken) When they lay me away
The last words they'll speak
Here lies a man that don't rest in peace
Here lies a man that don't rest in peace
