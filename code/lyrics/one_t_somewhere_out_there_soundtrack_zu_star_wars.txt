Song:

(Refrain)
Somewhere; out there; there is a place where dreams come true
Somewhere; out there; a lovely place for me and you

If you believe there's a tomorrow
You'll believe in pain and sorrow
Understand to work on love
The love you give like one above
I understand just how you feel
I understand your pain is real
But keep your head up to the sky
And don't forget the reason why

And if you don't believe it's true
Look through my eyes and find the truth
Oh what so clean so try to me (?)
I'll find this world for me and you

You won't be strong and take my hand
I'm sure that you will understand
That so we are reather blue
And there's a place for me and you

Somewhere; out there; there is a place where dreams come true
Somewhere; out there; a lovely place for me and you
Somewhere; out there; there is a place where dreams come true

Somewhere; out there; there is a place where dreams come true
Somewhere; out there; a lovely place for me and you
Somewhere; out there; a lovely place for me and you
