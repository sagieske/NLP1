Song:

Let's dance in style, 
Lets dance for a while
Heaven can wait 
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best 
But expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power 
But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, 
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Forever young, 
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, 
Forever young

Some are like water, 
Some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young

Forever young, 
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever and never

Forever young, 
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever, 
Forever, 
Forever young
