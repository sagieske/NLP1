Song:

You gave me chances and I let you down
You waited for words that I couldn't get out
I have no excuses for the way that I am
I was clueless then, I couldn't understand

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see

I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted, from me

An oooohhh

Could I be selfish, or lost in my pride
Afraid to be forward, or just to scared to try
And Now I'm without you, and it took distance to see
That losing you, means losing everything

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see

And I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted, from me

And is it too late, and are you too far
To turn around and let me be

Let me be

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
I'll show a side of me I never let you see

I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
Yeah That's all you ever wanted,
And that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted,

From me... Oh, from me
