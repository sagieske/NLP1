Song:

Secret shadows, watch them shimmer
Soft reflections in your eyes

Will you see me?
Will you touch me?
In the rain.

Restless feelings as I watch you
Try to hold them deep inside

Will you love me?
Will you hold me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain.

Touching softly in the darkness
Your lips tasting passions rise

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
In the rain.

Secret shadows, still reflections
Drawing me into your eyes

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain.

Breathless waiting, as I wonder
Tasting passions, kiss goodbye

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
In the rain, in the rain.

Will you love me?
Will you leave me?
Why can't you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain.
