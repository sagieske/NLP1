Song:

First of all I was surprised
How you looked into the mirror
I could see the holy spirit there
You saw a dancing bear

You were young and I was younger
I did everything you said 
I remember my big sister
I was five and she was ten

Taught me most of what I know
How to swim and play piano
I remember how you held my hand
The first time I heard Graceland

Never had to learn my numbers
Never had to learn to share
On the floor and in the garden
Judy Garland, Fred Astaire

You could be easily me
And I could be easily you
And I know I would be proud
To say it if it were true
And all the things that I've said
And things that I've done to you

You were young and I was younger
I did everything you said
Now I remember my big sister
I was five and she was ten
I was five and she was ten
