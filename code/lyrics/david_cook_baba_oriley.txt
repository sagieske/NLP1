Song:

Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I give my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Teenage wasteland
Ooh yeah
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
Oh yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!

Teenage waste
