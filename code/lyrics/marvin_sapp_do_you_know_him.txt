Song:

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do ya, do ya?

He rolled the stone away
And He rose again to give me another chance
Turned water into wine, preached from sea to sea
Saved three brothers from the fire and delivered me

Tell me who is this man
That makes the minimum waves obey His command
Some say Elijah, some say a prophet, some say a teacher
Tell me, do you know who He is?

People talking, people always talking
Everybody's talking 'bout a new thang
Don't we know that Jesus is the real thang?
Do you know it, you know it, you know it, you know?
Get up, get up

He stepped out of eternity into time
And to seal on my behalf and to redeem lost man
He spoke and it was, He created dust
By the power of His voice, here's the keys to your life

People talking, people always talking
Everybody's talking 'bout a new thang
Don't we know that Jesus is the real thang?
Do you know it, you know it, you know it, you know?

People talking, always saying something,
Everybody's talking 'bout a new thang
Don't we know that Jesus is the real thang?
Do you know it, you know it, you know it, you know?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do ya, do ya?
Do you know?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know who Jesus is?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him,
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know who Jesus is?
Do you know?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him,
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?

Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?

Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do you know Jesus?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?

Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
What's His name?

Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do you know Jesus?

Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?
Do ya?
Do ya know Him?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him,
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him,
Do ya, do ya?
Get up

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?

Do you know Him?
Do you know Him?
Do you know Him,
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya?
