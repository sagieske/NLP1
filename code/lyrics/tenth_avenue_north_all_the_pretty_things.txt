Verse 1
We are, we are we're caught in the inbetween
Of who we already are and who we're yet to be
We're looking for love but finding we're still in need
It's only what we have lost will be allowed to keep

Bridge
And we're waiting
But our eyes are wandering
To all this earth holds dear

Chorus
Look at all the pretty things that steal my heart away
I can feel I'm fading
Cause Lord I love so many things that keep me from your face
Come and save me

Verse 2
We run,
We run to finally be set free
But we're fighting for what
We already have recieved

Bridge

Chorus

(Chanting part with all the Ohs)
Verse 3 (Repeat 2X)
We are, we are we're caught in the inbetween
But we're fighting for what we already have recieved

(Ends with chanting)
Chorus
