Song:

Don't you worry.
Don't you moan.
We're all living in a casualty zone.
Drink yourself silly.
Were you a victim of your own neurosis?
Did you band your head?
Are you accident prone?

Name your poison. Is it your religion?
Name your poison. Drowned in the system.

Got you on a misdemeanor.
Don't want no derogatory remarks.
So we are the dregs of your society.
Disenfranchised we fell through the net.

Name your poison. Practice your religion.
Name your poison. Bow to the system.
