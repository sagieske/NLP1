Song:

So here it goes
The story of my life so I've been told
Get on follow boy or you'll be left out in the cold

But I don't adapt
I'll let y'all adapt to me
In a business meeting wearing a hat matching to my t-shirt and jeans

But I don't give a damn
'Cause I know who I am
And you don't gotta understand
'Cause I can't change for no man

I chose to go along the road less traveled
I chose to go the road less traveled yeah

I play the American Game
But I don't play the same
I got my hat tipped down
I got my peace sign out
And I'm not gonna change

So here I am
Generation X and that now I'm happy as hell
'Cause I'm rockin' in here
On American soil, mmmm put it back

Because of you my friends
I can live my life and I can be
Free to be me
It's such a feeling to
Not have to give a damn
'Cause I know who I am
And ya'll don't gotta understand
'Cause I don't change for no man

'Cause I chose, to go along that road less traveled yeah
I chose to go along the road less traveled

I play the American Game
But I don't play the same
I got my hat tipped down
I got my peace sign out
And I'm not gonna change

If you don't give a damn
Let me see y'all raise your hands
You see you don't understand for no man
Help me sing

I play the American Game
But I don't play the same
I got my hat tipped down
I got my peace sign out
And I'm not gonna change

I play the American Game
But I don't play the same
I got my hat tipped down
I got my peace sign out
And I'm not gonna change

I play the American Game
But I don't play the same
I got my hat tipped down
I got my peace sign out
And I'm not gonna change

I play the American Game
