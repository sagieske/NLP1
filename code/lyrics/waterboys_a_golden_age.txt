Song:

I heard a rumour of a golden age
And the stage is gettin' set
I heard a rumour of a golden age
The stage is gettin' set
I heard a rumour of a golden age
In the song, on a screen and printed page
And all the world will be a stage
And the stage is gettin' set

I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
And the dawn is comin' through
I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
And the dawn is comin' through
I've seen the glow of a golden dawn
And all will wait to gaze upon
And though the hour is hard and long
The dawn is coming through

I felt the wind behind my heels
And it feels good to me
I felt the wind behind my heels
And it feels good to me
I felt the wind behind my heels
My soul fired up like catherine wheels
And I'm never gonna forget how it feels
And it feels good to me

I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
I saw a ship come sailing in
I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
I saw a ship come sailing in
I stood on the side of a shimmering sea
Said "Lord, I surrender" and fell on my knees
And loving rose in the heart of me
And the ship came sailing in

I heard a rumour of a golden age
