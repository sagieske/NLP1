Song:

Morning people
Wandering, where is home
She cries, mother
Father, all alone
Where is hipe she prays
A bowl of food could buy
Another day
She wants to fly away
Look at me
Got shoes I never wear
Look at me
Got Fancy clothes I tear
Time to eat
Leave half and just don't care
Cause I never have to hear the
Echoes of the desert prayer
Night falls, darkness
Hunger meets the cold
She's just seven
Her eyes are old
Where is God today
His messenger's asleep in satin
Sheets his love's so far away
Yeah, I've got friends to spare
I've got Dreams
Got castles in the air
Broken hearts
Are my only care
Cause I never have to hear the
Echoes of a desert prayer
Lord don't take my hope away
Don't take my hope
My hope morning people
Wandering, where is home
Don't take my hope away
Don't take my
Don't take my hope away
Morning people
Wandering, where is home
