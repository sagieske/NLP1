Song:

[Verse:]
Guess my suspicions all on you were right
You brought the hurricane into my life
Here's the truth, you wanted more
How it feels on your own
Just blurry images of us in mind

I used to cry, I used to worry
But now you say you're so damn sorry
How could you be kind but still so cruel?

[Chorus:]
Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight
And though my mind is always changing
Won't you give my heart a break?
Try to fix the broken pieces once again
Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away

[Verse 2:]
Nothing could feel the same between us two
You seemed to want me now I don't want you
I used to fall in the trash
Hard to find my way back
And now you hate it that I wear the shoes

I used to cry, I used to worry
But now you say you're so damn sorry
How could you pretend to be so real?

[Chorus:]
Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight
And though my mind is always changing
Won't you give my heart a break?
Try to fix the broken pieces once again
Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away

[Bridge:]
Just close your eyes
Hide away from the monster in disguise
None of learned to love
There ain't nothing I'm afraid of now

Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight

[Chorus:]
Don't say that this is what it feels like
You've got my heart under a headlight
And though my mind is always changing
Won't you give my heart a break?
Try to fix the broken pieces once again
Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away

Don't say that this is what it feels like
To give your heart away
