Song:

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Pink lipstick, cigarette butts,
I lie in bed, I hate my guts
A day in the dark, a murdered afternoon, yeah
Oh baby darling, how I'd love,
To become your suicide blonde
To lie beside my Romeo
Oh what a wicked way to go

It only takes two lonely people, to f**k love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil, to f**k up two beautiful people
L. O. V. E, L. O. V. E., L. O. V. E., E. V. O. L
L. O. V. E do you love me?
L. O. V. E love is evil

Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker
Every kiss you give me makes me sicker
A day in the dark, a day in the cloud of gloom, yeah
I look at you, you look at me
Milk and roses, squeaky clean
Well you're the best I've ever seen
And I'm your dying beauty queen.

It only takes two lonely people, to f**k love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil, to f**k up two beautiful people
L. O. V. E, L. O. V. E., L. O. V. E., E. V. O. L
L. O. V. E do you love me?
L. O. V. E love is evil

Yeah

It only takes two lonely people, to f**k love up and make it evil
It only takes a drop of evil, to f**k up two beautiful people
L. O. V. E, L. O. V. E., L. O. V. E., E. V. O. L
L. O. V. E do you love me?
L. O. V. E love is evil

Do you, do you, you love me?
L. O. V. E, E. V. O. L
Do you love me
L. O. V. E love is evil
