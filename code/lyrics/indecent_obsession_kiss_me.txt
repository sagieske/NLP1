Song:

X-cuse me for staring, your looks have me blinded,
You want to touch me, so don't try and fight it,
And kiss me...
I'd walk your sweet curves for days without water,
My drink is your lips don't you think you outta,
Just kiss me...
Blond and ambitious you're dancing with wild boys,
Melting the ice round my heart, girl, with your voice
Strawberry lips saying, Baby I want you,
Raising my fever tonight so why don't you
Just kiss me, oh woh oh, kiss me...
This conversation is making me nervous,
Please pay attention, imagine we're lovers,
And kiss me...
You turn me on, turn me off like a flashlight,
Feel like a blindman who's taking the night-flight,
So kiss me...
I am the mirror who holds your reflection,
You can't resist me, I am your infection...
Strawberry lips saying, Baby I want you,
Raising my fever tonight so why don't you
Just kiss me, oh woh oh, kiss me...
Strawberry lips call my name so inviting,
Can't think of anything else more exciting,
So kiss me, oh woh oh, kiss me
(nanananananana)
Dressed to the teeth in your soft skin and perfume,
Only my heart cuts the silence in your room...
Strawberry lips saying, Baby I want you,
Raising my fever tonight so why don't you
Just kiss me, oh woh oh
Strawberry lips are my favorite flavour,
Drinking their colour is all that I'm made for,
So kiss me, oh woh oh, kiss me, oh woh oh
Kiss me, oh woh oh, kiss me, oh woh oh...
Strawberry lips call my name so inviting,
Can't think of anything else more exciting,
So kiss me, oh woh, kiss me, oh woh oh...
