Song:

I know now you gave your best
That is all I ever really asked
And how it all went down
I'm all through putting all of that on you
And how I threw myself around
Trying to find the man outside of you
And how it goes is like this
All that I am and have these days can all be traced
Back to you

Elizabeth
I wonder if... My best
Would have ever been enough for you
And how it all went down
I'm all through putting all of that on me
And how I watched you thrash around
Trying to right the wrongs that don't belong to you

Both:
Once and for all it's like this
All that I am and have these days can all be traced

Back to you
Back to you
