Song:

Something that breaks your head
Something that may change your mind
It's something that you don't wanna tell cause you're scared to change your life

So get get away, get getta get away
Before you die
Get get away, get get away from here until you can
Whatever you may say now is wrong

[Chorus:]
Cut away, cut away, there's nothing to say
Let it sting deep in your head
You need to change over
Cut away, cut away, there's nothing to say
Do it as fast as you can
You need to change over

Overrated directions from a friend that you trust so much
You're on the line where honesty stops and then your life starts
And nobody can help you nobody's there for you
You're walking by yourself
Whatever you thought before it's gone

[Chorus:]

Never look back [x3]
Nobody knows what you know, what you've seen and how bad you have been

Cut away, cut away, there's nothing to say
Let it sting deep in your head
You need to change over

[Chorus:]

You need to change over, cut away, cut away
