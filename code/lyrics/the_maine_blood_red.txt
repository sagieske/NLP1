Song:

My, my, my
What fangs you have
Once upon a time
Your eyes were wide not dead

Then all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red

You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh, you're blood red, baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless, darling

Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red

What's it like
Living with your disease
You walk the streets at night
Looking like a well-dressed thief

Once all the chemistry
Destroyed the memories
Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red

You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh, you're blood red, baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless, darling

Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red

You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh, you're blood red, baby
It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless, darling

Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red
