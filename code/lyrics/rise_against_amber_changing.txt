Song:

Information kept to myself and everybody wants to know,
I trust the words of no one else cause I've been there before,
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
These calloused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen,
These eyes don't wander as far as they at one time did,
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
There's no time that I'd rather be than right here, right now

I'm on the other end begging you, pick up the phone,
A shaking whisper is answering: "don't call anymore"
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening
Freeze me in this moment, thaw me in ten years,
When the fires burned out and the smoke (clears)

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
There's no time that I'd rather be than right here, right now

Let's just pretend, let's just pretend
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight will never end
Let's just pretend, let's just pretend, tonight will never end

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
There's no time that I'd rather be than right here, right now
