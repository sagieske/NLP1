Song:

I'm a red blooded, rough neck son of a b***h
I'm a god damned American Capitalist
I got a kill em all give a s**t license to hate
I'm that one shot one kill bringer of fate

I don't wanna believe I'm empty, I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I'm becoming like, I'm an American... Capitalist
(American Capitalist)

War is the answer like I told you before
You're a coward with the power just to stay on the floor
If you're a man, be a man, stop running you lips
Round 3, no mercy, it's the way of the fist

I don't wanna believe I'm empty, I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I'm becoming like, I'm an American... Capitalist
(American Capitalist)

I don't wanna believe I'm empty, I don't wanna admit I'm wrong
I don't wanna regret who I'm becoming like, I'm an American... Capitalist
(American Capitalist)
