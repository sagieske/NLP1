Song:

She's got that crazy magic,
Super cali-fragi lipstick
She's got that swagalistic style

She's got that mesmerizing,
One look temperature rising,
She's got that hypnotizing smile

Ohh Ohh,
Her love is so contagious,
Ohh Ohh
I'm all about that

I'm all about that girl girl girl,
You know she's rocking my world world world,
I'm all about those sweet smile and the good times,
And the weak we feel when she's looking in my eyes

I hope when she looks at me,
I'm the only guy she sees,
And I hope it's true when she says I love you,
Cuz I'm all about that girl.

Those jeans that she's wearing,
All the boys will be staring,
Too late cuz she's already mine,

She's on another level,
She's all kind of special,
She's like an angel in my eyes

Ohh Ohh,
Her love is so contagious,
Ohh Ohh,
I'm all about that

I'm all about that girl girl girl,
You know she's rocking my world world world,
I'm all about those sweet smiles and the good times,
And the weak we feel when she's looking in my eyes

I hope when she looks at me,
I'm the only guy she sees,
And I hope it's true when she says I love you,
Cuz I'm all about that girl

I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,

Now when she looks at me that way,
She doesn't have to say anything at all,
Because I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about her

I'm all about that girl girl girl,
You know she's rocking my world world world,
I'm all about those sweet smile and the good times,
And the weak we feel when she's looking in my eyes

I hope when she looks at me,
I'm the only guy she sees,
And I hope it's true when she says I love you,
Cuz I'm all about that girl.

I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,

I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl

I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,
I'm all about,
I'm all about that girl,

I'm all about that girl

I'm all about that girl
