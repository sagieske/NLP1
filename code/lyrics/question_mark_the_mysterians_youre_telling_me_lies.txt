Song:

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

Your told me this morning
You love me so
But still I know you lie

You better stop, girl
You better stop now

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

You better stop
You better stop, girl

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

What happened last night? You was so real
And so much in love
What did I say to change your mind?
And give me the brush

You better stop, girl
You better stop now

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

You better stop, girl
You better stop now

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

Alright

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry
Can't you see?

Your told me this morning
You love me so
But still I know you lie

You better stop, girl
You better stop now

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

You better stop
You better stop, girl

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry

You're telling me lies
You're putting me down
You stand to make me cry
