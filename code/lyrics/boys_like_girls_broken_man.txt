Song:

I want to scream until no sound comes out and you've learned your lesson
I want to swallow these pills to get to sleep
So I don't have to make a bad impression
I need to start to be myself
'Cause I'm sick of everybody else

I won't let you bring me down
It's here
And now I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man

I wanna run, but only far enough to make you miss me
I wanna take back all the s**t that I have done
But I guess you are better off without me
I need to start to be myself
'Cause I'm sick of everybody else

I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now
I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man

I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate

I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate

I took one big step and I looked away
And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say
I'm always too late
You never got your story straight
I'm always up late
I think I'm everything you hate

I won't let you bring me down
It's here and now
I'm breaking out
I will learn to love again
But I will stand a broken man

(I took one big step and I looked away)
I won't let you bring me down
(And then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say)
It's here and now I'm breaking out
(I'm always too late you never got your story straight I'm always up late I think I'm everything you hate)
I will learn to love again
(I took one big step then I looked away, and then I thought of all the things that I wanted to say)
But I will stand a broken man
(I'm always too late you never got your story straight)
