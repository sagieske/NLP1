Song:

If you got something to say
Then come my way
I'm guarded by satan
I'm riding on baphomet
I'll teach you a lesson in violence
You won't soon forget

The pleasure of watching you Die
Is what I will get

Fight - for what you believe to be right
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
They run from the fire in my eyes

Nothing can save them now
You've learned a lesson in violence
Get on your knees and bow
Or learn a lesson in violence

I love to stab my victims
Until they're dead
A knife to the throat
Or a smashing blow to the head
I'm judge and jury
My sentence has just been passed
Step into the circle of hell
If you think you can last

Fight for what you believe to be right
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
They run from the fire in my eyes

Nothing can save them now
You've learned a lesson in violence
Get on your knees and bow
Or learn a lesson in violence!
