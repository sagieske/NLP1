Song:

And don't you tell, nobody
And don't you tell, nobody
Don't you tell, nobody
Baby, what-a we done, done

Well, you made me weep
And you made me moan
You made me do things
That I knew was wrong

You made me jump
Then made me shout
Early in the mo'nin
You knocked me out

But don't you tell, nobody
Don't you tell, nobody
Don't you tell, nobody
And baby, what we done, done

(piano boogie & instrumental)

And don't ya tell, nobody
And don't ya tell, nobody
Don't ya tell, nobody
And baby what a-we done, done

Well, you made me happy
Then you made me sad
Made me feel good
Then you made me mad

You made me laugh
Oh then you made me cry
Early in the mo'nin'
And you told me good-bye

And don't ya tell, nobody
Don't ya tell, nobody
Don't ya tell, nobody
And baby what a-we done, done

And don't ya tell, nobody
Don't tell nobody

Fade:

Don't ya tell, nobody
An baby what a-we done, done.
