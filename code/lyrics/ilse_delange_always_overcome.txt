Song:

Like the sun at my window
In the morning when I wake
I am taken without warning
By the light in your face
Sometimes it scares me darling
This feeling of constant ache
As if you came much closer
My heart would surely break
Chorus:
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
Used to feel like I was drifting
Always in and out of love
Ever since you've been with me
I can't stand to leave you arms
Chorus:
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
All this love
All these years
Made my life something real
If I had never found you
Don't think I would believe
Love so strong could surround me
That I could lift me off my knees
Chorus:
It never ceases me to amaze me
When it's said and done
After all this time when I am with you
I am always overcome
All this love
All these years
Made my life something real
