Song:

[Iyaz]
It's gonna take a lot
To drag me away from you
There's nothing that
A hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time
But I know you're worth fighting for

[Stevie Hoang]
I'll fight for you
Oh ohh
I'll fight for you
(Stevie Hoang)
Oh ohh
I'll fight for you
(Iyaz in the building)
Oh ohh
I'll fight for you
Oh ohh

[Stevie Hoang]
Girl I know everywhere we go
They don't wanna see us together
Girl just don't take your love away
Cause I'm willing to do whatever
Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Girl, I just wanna be your guy
Just know that we will be alright
Cause as lovers we'll prepair to fight

Cause baby I don't wanna go another day
And I don't wanna see another face
I'm not gonna let them tear us down
I'm doing this song, you know

[Iyaz]
I'll fight for you
It's gonna take a lot
To drag me away from you
There's nothing that
A hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time
But I know you're worth fighting for
Let's go

[Stevie Hoang]
What they say
It don't even matter
Cause they don't really understand
What we have is gonna last forever
And I'mma do the best I can
Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Girl, I just wanna be your guy
Just know that we will be alright
Cause as lovers we'll prepair to fight

Cause baby I don't wanna go another day
And I don't wanna see another face
I'm not gonna let them tear us down
I'm doing this song, you know

[Iyaz]
I'll fight for you
It's gonna take a lot
To drag me away from you
There's nothing that
A hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time
But I know you're worth fighting for

[Stevie Hoang]
Now if you got someone
That's worth fighting for
Don't let nobody hold you down
Let me here you say ooo, ooo, ooo
(Ooo, ooo, ooo)
Say ooo, ooo, ooo
And if you find someone
That's worth dying for
The one you can't live without
Let me here you say ooo, ooo, ooo
(Ooo, ooo, ooo)
Ooo, ooo, ooo
(Ooo, ooo, ooo)

I don't wanna go another day
And I don't wanna see another face
I'm not gonna let them tear us down
I'm doing this song, you know

[Iyaz]
I'll fight for you
It's gonna take a lot
To drag me away from you
There's nothing that
A hundred men or more could ever do
Just like the way down in Africa
It's gonna take some time
But I know you're worth fighting for
