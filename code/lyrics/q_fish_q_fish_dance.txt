Song:

Take a step to the left - and one to the right
And now turn round - do it on the other side

Left hand on your hip - the right behind the neck
Now hop around the room - always be glad

Show us your teeth - and bang the head
Your tongue until the nose - absolutely mad

Ref.:
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast!
This is definitely your last chance-
Do the Q-fish dance!

2nd:
Now shake your bones - the legs to the ear
Shout the Q-Fish out - everybody wants to hear

Hoppin' round and round - with the tip of the toe
Pull your finger out - until the end of the show

This is the happiest dance - you've ever heard
Feel funny and amazed - we'll gonna paint the town red

Ref.:
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast!
This is definitely your last chance-
Do the Q-Fish dance!

Solo

Ref.:
(Bis zum Abwinken)
Hey Everybody - c'mon dance with us
Do it now and do it fast!
This is definitely your last chance-
Do the Q-fish dance!
