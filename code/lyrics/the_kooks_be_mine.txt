Song:

I never thought we'd come this far
But then how we come that far
And I won't let them in
Cause she's my lover and not my friend

I'm so scared to lose you now
So easy to lose you now
Because there calling at my door
So I'm locking up my door

Now my thoughts are very dark
And my dreams are always dark
Don't let them take me away
Cause I want me to stay

But be mine, oh
Won't you be mine, oh
Be mine, oh oh

Take it all outside
Cause you don't need it
Don't need to cry, oh no
Take it all outside
Cause you don't need me
Don't need to cry

I never thought we'd come this far
But then how we come that far
And I won't let them in
Cause she's my lover and not my friend

I'm so scared to lose it now
Oh it's so easy to lose it now
Because they're calling at my door
So I'm locking up my door

Oh be mine, oh
Wont you be mine, oh
Be mine
Be mine

Take it all outside
Cause you don't need it
Don't need to cry, oh no
Take it all outside
Cause you don't need me
Don't need to cry, yeah

So be mine, oh oh
Be mine, oh
