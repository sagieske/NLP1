Song:

He never put a foot wrong
Until the day Joe met Big William
He made him an offer but he often was wrong
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"
"Hey Joe, hear what I say
You want my time, I ain't giving away
Go make the money you want some other way"
"I don't want to go to Peru
Don't leave ?Delhi, you're any guru?
I don't like work and I don't like you"
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"
"I'll tell you where to stick it," said Big William to Joe
"You can put it where the monkey sticks his nuts"
"I wouldn't give you fourpence for your lousy rotten dough
And, anyway, you haven't got that much"
