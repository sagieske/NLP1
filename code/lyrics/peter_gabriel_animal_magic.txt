Song:

What did you mean when you opened your mouth and let all our secrets out?
You told him what I was about, my cover was completely blown.
I tell you darling, I've been watching the war films
And I've got a few ideas of my own,
Cause after the film had ended, the call for recruits was shown,

And I'll be joining the professionals, I want to be a man.
With all that animal magic I'll do anything you can.
I'm joining the professionals cause I want to be a man,
Look! I wave my wand, watch the rabbit disappear...
Join the professionals and learn to fight!

I bet the two of you still laugh at me for being timid as a lamb;
That may be the way I look, but it's no longer what I am.
I've been across to Northern Ireland,
And I came home with a new kind of charge:
I learned how to hunt in the night, I learned about camouflage.

I've been joining the professionals, and now that I'm a man
With all that animal magic I'll match anything you can.
I'm joining the professionals, this time I understand,
Look! I wave my wand, watch the rabbit disappear...
Join the professionals and learn to fight!
