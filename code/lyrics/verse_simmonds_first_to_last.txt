Song:

Since I've found you, you, you
Everything's clear now, my word seems brand new, new
You opened the door to my heart, and you just walked through
I was just like any other, from lover to lover, like a damn fool
Never had nothing to loose, 
Just when I least expected it, you came along and
Changed me for the better, and now I got a new plan

[Chorus]
You're my first love, like the first kiss
You're the first one, that I'll miss
From the first day, that we first met
For the first time, I know you'll
The first to be my last
You know that you're special, and I'm luck that I found baby
You be the first to be my last
Don't need to search no more, yeah
Uh baby, I ain't going nowhere

You're the missing piece to the puzzle in my life
Baby cause you bad and you know it
When I wanna throw it, I just wanna love you right
Because a man is just a man, 
Without someone who can, always be there
I almost gave up, and when I least expected it, you came along and
Changed me for the better, and now I got a new plan

[Chorus]
You're my first love, like the first kiss
You're the first one, that I'll miss
From the first day, that we first met
For the first time, I know you'll
The first to be my last
You know that you're special, and I'm luck that I found baby
You be the first to be my last
Don't need to search no more, yeah
Uh baby, I ain't going nowhere
Oh, uh baby, oh

Just when I least expected it, you came along and
Changed me for the better, and now I got a new plan

[Chorus]
You're my first love, like the first kiss
You're the first one, that I'll miss
From the first day, that we first met
For the first time, I know you'll
The first to be my last
You know that you're special, and I'm luck that I found baby
You be the first to be my last
Don't need to search no more, yeah
Uh baby, I ain't going nowhere.
