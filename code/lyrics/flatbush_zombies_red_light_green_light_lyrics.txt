Song:

[Intro: Espa]
I lift my hands up high for another night
Cause I lost my wings and I wanna fly
I even wash my face in the river Nile
Imma pray all day 'til I get it right

[Hook 1 (x2): Erick Arc Elliot]
Before I leave the crib I know I say my prayers
Pray to God I'm happy every single day I swear
More money I'm more prepared more n****s that's unaware
Most n****s don't even listen they only see what they hear

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
My mind ain't certain
That I put enough work in
These beats, these streets, no purpose
Repeat, rebuild, resurface
No longer in disturbance
Get a shooter if your nervous
Stressed out made a n***a feel worthless
Can't nobody f**k up on purpose (on purpose)
I remember when I had no government
My name was so crazy, had lines like cocaine
And those the good days, I got them good grades
Had profit to get paid, I made some mistakes
That's something we all gone say
Had to ignore a b***h called today
But a little bit of head made it all okay
If you n****s want a war then my boys gone play

[Hook 2 (x2): Meechy Darko]
Before I leave the crib you better say your prayers
N****s trigger happy every single day I swear
More murder I'm more aware, more bullets I'm more prepared
Most n****s don't even listen that's until they hear the bang

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
My mind's uncertain, do I put enough work in
Red rum red rum, bloody murder
Head shot, close range, close curtains
No encore that's for certain
Clack clack, bravo, I murked 'em
Hoes, clothes, more drugs, more murder
More guns, more drugs, more murder (more murder)
In the ghetto where the rats eat roaches
Gats tucked in our drawers, we don't need holsters
You gone learn today, you gone get involved
We scamming, drug dealing, prostitution and all
In the ghetto praise to God alike a long distance call
I done rang Jesus for years, f**k it, no response
What? I'm supposed to sit and starve
Ha! Gat in my palm and taking your be my job
I don't want to shoot and steal
I don't want to kill and rob
I just want to provide
For my momma, my poppa, my kids and I
I just want to provide
For my b***h, and my homies that's from my side
But I came straight from homicide

[Hook 1: Erick Arc Alliot]

[Hook 2: Meechy Darko]
