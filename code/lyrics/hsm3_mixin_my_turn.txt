Song:

[Troy:]
I'm left here again
With a decision to make,
Gotta sort out my priorities,
And in the midst of it all
I gotta stop to think,
My choice will hurt the ones
It doesn't involve.

[Chorus:]
I find myself,
Then lose again
Mixin' my turn
Confusing my role.
I can't seem to win,
And I can't seem to help,
So when it comes to my turn
I'll just play my part.

[Troy:]
It seems to me,
I have two choices;
I can play the game,
Or I can sing the line,
It's a never ending struggle
And I can't breathe
To think right.

[Chorus:]

[Troy:]
I got the world on my shoulders
Two opposites collide
And I don't know what to do
When the power's in my hands.

[Chorus:]

[Troy:]
Mixin' my turn,
Confusing my role,
Mixin' my turn,
I'm always mixin' my turn.

"We know now,
Don't need a second thought,
It will never end
