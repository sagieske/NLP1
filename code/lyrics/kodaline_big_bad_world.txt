Song:

Maybe I’m wrong
Or maybe I’m right
Maybe it’s just too late but this is keeping me awake all night.
Maybe say yes or maybe say no
Maybe I’m just too shy to admit that it is time to go.

We go out on our own
It’s a big bad world outside
Carrying’ our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile.

Maybe believe
Or maybe don’t care
Shit, maybe there is no god in the big white clouds up there
Maybe live long
Or maybe die young
Or maybe live every day like it’s your last day under the sun.

We go out on our own
It’s a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile [x2]

We go out on our own
It’s a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Try to make it all feel right

Ohhhhhhhh…

We go out on our own
It’s a big bad world outside
Carrying our dreams and all that they mean
Trying to make it all worthwhile [x2]

Ohhhhhhhh…
