Song:

Anna: Okay, can I just, say something crazy?

Hans: I love crazy! 

Anna: All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you

Hans: I was thinking the same thing! â€˜Cause like
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place
And maybe it's the party talking or the chocolate fondue

Anna: But with you
Hans: But with you

Hans: I found my place
Anna: I see your face

Both: And it's nothing like I've ever known before
Love is an open door
Love is an open door
Love is an open door

Anna: With you
Hans: With you
Anna: With you
Hans: With you

Both: Love is an open door

Hans: I mean it's crazy
Anna: What?

Hans: We finish each other's
Anna: Sandwiches

Hans: That's what I was gonna say! 

Anna: I've never met someone

Both: Who thinks so much like me
Jinx! Jinx again! 
Our mental synchronization
Can have but one explanation

Hans: You
Anna: And I
Hans: Were
Anna: Just

Both: Meant to be

Anna: Say goodbye
Hans: Say goodbye

Both: To the pain of the past
We don't have to feel it any more
Love is an open door
Love is an open door
Life can be so much more

Anna: With you
Hans: With you
Anna: With you
Hans: With you

Both: Love is an open door

Hans: Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me?
Anna: Can I say something even crazier? Yes!
