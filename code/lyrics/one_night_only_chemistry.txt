Song:

Maybe I'ts the chemistry,
The sparks that fly from you to me
I touch your skin, I feel alive
Been searching for you every night.

Where am I supposed to go?
I'm hoping that you won't say no
We've got all the time in the world.

It must be the chemistry, tonight
I hope you that know
I won't let you go this time

It must be the chemistry, between you and I
I hope that you know
I won't let you go this time

Underneath the starry sky,
You can bring me back to life.
I touch your skin, I feel alive
Been searching for you every night.

Take me somwhere I don't know,
Watch all the people down below,
We've got all the time in the world.
