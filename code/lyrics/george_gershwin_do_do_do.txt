Song:

Oh, do, do, do
What you've done
Done, done before, baby
Do, do, do
What I do
Do, do adore, baby

Let's try again
Sigh again
Fly again to heaven
Baby, see
It's A, B, C
I love you
And you love me

I know, know, know
What a beau, beau, beau
Should do, baby

So don't, don't, don't
Say it won't, won't, won't
Come true, baby

My heart begins to hum
Dum, de, dum
De, dum, dum, dum

So do, do, do
What you've done
Done, done before

(Repeat lyrics)
