Song:

The day that you decide to follow
And choose to end the war within
If your present situation is a constant aggravation
You feel so trapped in your sin.

Just remember that a battle makes us stronger
Even though we feel we can't fight any longer
If we just believe his words we will see his power
Grace will find us in that hour

It's already done
It's already won
It's already done
It's already won

If you decide tonight to follow
Count the cost and take a ride
On a train that's on a run
Forever circling the Son

Always by his side
You can lose all of your yesterdays in heaven
All the powers in your past are laid to rest
If you ever wanted out
So bad it made you shout
Believe when you face the test

It's already done
It's already won
It's already done
It's already won

It's already done
It's already won
It's already done
