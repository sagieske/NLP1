Song:

From the inside lookin' out
You're the one that I've been thinkin' about
I'm a lonely little fool over you babe
Got me dazed and confused
Got my body cryin' the blues
Come and see me
Got a line I'm throwing to you
You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind
I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready
And you passed every test
You left me here starved and obsessed
With a hunger that begs for you
Draw, aim, fire
You can't run from my desire
It's my arrow through your heart surrender to me
You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind
I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready
You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind
I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready
I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready
