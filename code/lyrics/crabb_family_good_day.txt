Song:

(1st Verse)
The ship was rocking from the storm.
The disciples cried in fear they would be harmed.
Somebody spoke up, the Lord's not here.
We're sure to perish, does he not care.
But in the midst of all the panic, winds and waves,
Jesus turned it into a good day.

[Chorus:]
You may feel like your world is closing in,
Busted, sick, and lonely with no friends.
Rattled by the circumstance you face,
You can't get out of this one there's no
Way but he steps in and makes it a good day.

(2nd Verse)
I've come in battles, my self I could not win.
There was evil all around and closing in.
But I remembered whose child I am.
I reached for courage and stood my ground.
When I had quoted every promise I could say,
Jesus turned it into a good day.
