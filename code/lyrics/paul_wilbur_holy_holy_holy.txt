Song:

Holy Holy Holy
Is the God of Israel
Elders bow in worship
As the angel voices swell
Fragrant clouds of incense
Swirl around Your throne of grace
Lord we bow in worship
At the brilliance of Your face
We cry

Holy Holy Holy is the Lord
Holy Holy Holy is the Lord

Holy Holy Holy
Is the song that Heaven sings
All creation praise Him
Hallelujah Elohim
Come to reign forever
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lift your head O Zion
Open wide you ancient doors
And cry
