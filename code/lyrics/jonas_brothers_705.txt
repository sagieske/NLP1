Song:

We had a lot of good times when we were together
And I thought we'd last forever, you and I
I am for so long I couldn't wait to get your phone call
Dreaming 'bout you makes me feel alright
That night you called me on the phone
Said you had to stay at home
Is there something I should know?

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone
I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye

The night after your phone call me and friends were hanging at the mall
I was not believing what I saw
You're holding hands with him and sitting closer then six inches
Hoping she's not gonna kiss him now
How can I call you friend?
You stood me up in the end
I know that it's over

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone
I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye

Don't keep telling me
That you're sorry now
But let me tell you
How much this hurts me too
I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone
I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I was fine till 7: 05
Till she walked out the door and right out of my life
If you're gone
I'll move on
But it only would have taken two seconds to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
It only would of taken two seconds to say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
