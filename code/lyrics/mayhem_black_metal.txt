Song:

Originally performed by Venom
Black is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records the first note.
We chime the hell, chaos and hell
Metal for maniacs pure.
Fast melting steel, fortune on wheels

For black metal
Lay down your sold to the gods rock'n'roll

Freaking so wild, nobody's mild
Giving it all that you've got.
Wild is so right, metal tonight
Faster than over the top.
Open the door, enter hells core
Black is the code for tonight
Atomic force, feel no remorse
Trunk up the amps now it's night

Black metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock'n'roll

Metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
Riding hells stallions bareback and free
Faking our chances with raw energy

Come ride the night with us
Rock hard and fight
United my legions we stand
Freak hard and wild for us
Give up your souls
Live for the guest satans band

Against the adds, black metal gods
Fight to achieve our goal
Tasting a spell, leather and hell
Black metal gods rock'n'roll
Building up steam, nuclear screams
War-heads are ready to fight
Black leather hounds, faster than sound
Metal our purpose in life.

Black metal
Lay down your soul to the gods rock'n'roll
