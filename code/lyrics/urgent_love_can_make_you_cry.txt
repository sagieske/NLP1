Song:

What makes us cry
What makes us fall
Why does it all crumble at night

Since you've been gone
I carry on
Waiting for you to walk through the door

But the more I think of you
The more I want to say I miss you

Love's got a hold on me, oh my
Love can make you cry
I don't know how, I don't know why
But love can make you cry

So many things
I don't understand
You were always there holding my hand

If love is gone
Then just give me time
I know we can start over again

Cause the more I think of you
The more I want to say I love you

Love's got a hold on me, oh my
Love can make you cry
I don't know how, I don't know why
But love can make you cry
