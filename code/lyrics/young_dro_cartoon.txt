Song:

[Chorus:]
Ride wit da tooley
Broads wanna do me
Dead Fresh Louie
Ice-berg Goofie
Cops wanna do me
I live like a movie
6's on the dualy
Stay blowin fruity

[Chorus:]

[Verse 1:]
N****s scared of me, my potnas say
They beggin for the chopper play
Body guard killas got a house where Kevin Costner stay
Might just play some golf today
Never put the glock away
Jackas try to 2-step I make they a** rock away
Elegant, catch me at a symphany and opera play
Paint the 'rarri poppa grey and blow the whole top away
No matter what the coppers say
Still move a block a day
All you n****s pop or play or lay where Jimmy Hoffe lay
Rebel outlaw, that's the same s**t that Pac would say
N****s gotta walk away, My chopper long as Dr. J
Amarilla gots to play, I might hop on the yacht today
Not today but f**k it Ima kill 'em in the block today

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Trans Am wit the candy coat
Wait til ya see the Phantom though
Spend dollars with ya ho eatin grapes and cantelope
Shawty said she wanna see me naked like De'angelo
Guts on deck, f**k playin I'll bam a ho
I can have an' ho, I aint wantin for an' ho
Grand Hustle in the buildin so what you sayin ho
Yall pop new cris, We drinkin that old cris
This cost mo' b***h, that '74 s**t
Bankhead n***a eatin octopus and swordfish
My whole clique gorgeous, say my name 'n forge it
Fake faggot-a** cliques full of Boy George's
They hate the team cuz the yard full of Rolls Royces

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
N****s try, aint no stoppin us, I fried 'em like Taloppia
I'm mafia, talkin to my german in the boxster
President dinner b***h, a grand for the lobster
A grand for the oysters, stuffed clam and bosperch
B***h I had talent way before they had apollo search
Above par work 'for Ed Mcmahon and star search
I called Kurt, found out I can rap and let 'em all heard
Several years later I'm the n***a in the tall vert
Section A killer man all I need is yard work
Hard work, flatland Adam-ville, dog work
Dey just mad to see me cuz my Chevy look like Starburst
Get ya feelings 'n all hurt, wait til ya see the fall vert

[Chorus x2]
