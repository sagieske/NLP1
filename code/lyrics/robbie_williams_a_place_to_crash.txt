Song:

I - I - I
I'm on a mission
To abuse my position
Abuse it with you

Love, I'm a cynical b***h
Gonna scratch that itch
With a b***h like you

Modern thinking's made me miserable
Everything is unforgivable
If not for you
I wouldn't come at all

Find a place to crash
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)
Move your boney a**
(Boom boom, boom boom labida)

Love me like I'm cash
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)
You can feel the class
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)

[Guitar]

If there's a freak in here
Looking for someone like me
I fit that description
Perfectly

Boom, boom, boom
I bet they'll resent you
They would if they met you
Met you with me

Every move you make is poetry
They all fake what you do naturally
If not for you
I wouldn't come at all

Find a place to crash
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)
Move your boney a**
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)

Love me like I'm cash
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)
You can see the clash
(Boom, boom, boom, boom, labida)

Kiss me with your mouth
Teach me with your brain
All right

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

They say I say
When I say nothing at all
Leaves a taste in my stomach
And it's no taste at all

I can't sing, I can't dance
That didn't stop me at all
It's a ball when I call, if I call you at all

Love is the reason but it won't pay my rent
Only palone fill your dish in the dent
I won't be happy 'till the moneys been spent
I forget to forget, oh, f**k it, oh, f**k it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
