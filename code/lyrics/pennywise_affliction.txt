Song:

Take a listen to what I say
I got the truth and
I'll help you find your way
It's time to take what you know is already yours
It's your life it's your right
You wake up every moment feeling
Numb until you die
Take a chance and walk right
Through that unopened door
That affliction that's the
Curse for the modern man
If you believe then you can't be wrong
Reject all the opposing opinions - and carry on
The affliction
That's the curse for the modern man
With blind faith you're never wrong
Reject all opposing opinions you can't go wrong
So make your
Pledges and place the blame
They got opinions and you hear them everyday
We got facts to back them up you just can't ignore
You gotta fight
Take a listen to what I say
I got the truth and
I'll help you find your way
It's time to take what you know is already yours
It's your life it's your right
You wake up every moment feeling
Numb until you die
Take a chance and walk right
Through that unopened door
That affliction that's the
Curse for the modern man
If you believe then you can't be wrong
Reject all the opposing opinions - and carry on
The affliction
That's the curse for the modern man
With blind faith you're never wrong
Reject all opposing opinions you can't go wrong
So make your
Pledges and place the blame
They got opinions and you hear them everyday
We got facts to back them up you just can't ignore
You gotta fight
For what's right
No matter if the truth just can't be
Seen in black and white
But don't think that's gonna stop 'em
Marching to war
