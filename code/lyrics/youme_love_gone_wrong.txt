Song:

Baby, baby, don't you come my way no more
I don't want you knocking at my doors
Baby, baby, why you treat do damn mean?
When I gave you my all, more than you ever see
Baby, baby, why can't you see my pain
Don't you undertsand what it's like to feel this way
Baby, baby, don't you come my way no more
Cause it won't be like the way it was before

Ours was just a love gone wrong
Don't that sound like a same old song
This time I'm gon' be moving on
Cause baby I'm gone, I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gone for good

Baby, baby, think you got this story wrong
You misunderstood me and my lovin all along
Baby, baby, could've all worked out just fine
But you came breaking me down
And working me time after time
And you say, Baby, baby, oh can't I see your pain?
Don't I understand what it's like to feel this way
Well, let me tell you baby

Baby, baby, won't you step into these shoes
Walk a mile with me
And then tell me who hurt who

Ours was just a love gone wrong
Don't that sound like a same old song
This time I'm moving on
Cause baby I'm gone, I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gone for good

We can go our separate ways
Hoping to find a better day
And there's no one there to chase
Won't you remember
We wanted the same

Ours was just a love gone wrong
Don't that sound like a same old song
This time I'm moving on
Cause baby I'm gone, I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm gone for good
