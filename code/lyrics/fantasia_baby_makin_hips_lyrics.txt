Song:

Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop

Watch when they walk by, guys get the wandering eye
They'd rather get smacked, then not look back
Tell you what's up with that
They see that wobble wobble, shaped just like a cola bottle
Thought you was a model, itty bitty waist
Hips hips all in they face, they see my

That's what'll get them boys in trouble, get his attention on the double
She got a walk so mean, gotta see it to believe, hey

She got them baby makin' hips, b-b-baby baby makin' hips
She's got them baby makin' hips
When she walks, they watchin' and she knows it
She's got them baby makin' hips, b-b-baby baby makin' hips
Watch her, watch her work them curves
Don't be mad 'cause that’s a nerve, oh

Strut without a care, gloss them lips, slick back that hair
Track suit fits you like a mitten, got them wishin', picturin' you with them
Caught 'em watching, like that dude I bet you got him
Rapped around your French manicured fingertips
That boy like em thick, hey yeah

That's what'll get them boys in trouble, get his attention on the double
She got a walk so mean, gotta see it to believe

She got them baby makin hips, she got 'em
B-b-baby baby makin hips, we got 'em
She's got them baby makin' hips
When she walks, they watchin' and she knows it, they watchin'
She's got them baby makin' hips, b-b-baby baby makin' hips
Watch her, watch her work them curves
Don't be mad 'cause that’s a nerve, oh

You got a feelin' like you really wanna get it
If you wit it, then get at him and go, go
Just put it on him, too late to warn him
Time to show that boy how you roll, roll

That's it, that's it just like that, come on girls
That's it, that's it just like that, work 'em out
That's it, that's it just like that, yeah
Wait a minute betta hurt 'em with those

Baby makin' hips but b-b-baby baby makin' hips
She got them baby makin' hips
When she walks, they watchin and she knows it
Baby makin' hips but b-b-baby baby makin' hips
Watch her, watch her work them curves
Don't be mad 'cause that's a nerve

Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
