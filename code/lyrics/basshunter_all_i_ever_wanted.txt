All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
I know that I love you o baby why don't you see

All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you o baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you o baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

(Drum and Base)
(Instrumental)

I'm so alone here on my own
And I'm waiting for you to come
I want to be a part of you
Think of all the things we could do
And everyday your in my head
I want to have you in my bed
You are the one, Your in my eyes
All I ever wanted in my life

All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you o baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you o baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

(Are you ready)

All I ever wanted was to see you smilin
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I no that I love you o baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted...
