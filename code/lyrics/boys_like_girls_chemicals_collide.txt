Song:

I got a couple addictions
But I swear I'm comin' clean
I got a new way of thinking
Yeah, you're bringing out the best in me
I got a bit of history
But you're telling me that you don't care
I've been a mystery
But the only thing I could find to wear tonight
Was you, ooo, so come on, come on, you want to

Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
You and I tonight, you're the sugar in my high
Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites, spinning round and round
On the night you saved my life

I got a couple of problems
A thousand puzzles running through my head
But I think that you could solve them
You're always just one step ahead
I've had a couple of heartbreaks
But you're telling me that it's alright
'Cause all the others were mistakes
Yeah, I think this time I finally got it right
With you, ooo, so come on, come on, you want to

Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites, spinning round and round tonight
Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
And I feel so alive, spinning round and round
Won the night you saved my life

When the morning is breaking
And your heart is shaken up
Remeber how it feels right now
When we're lost in the moment
The sky is exploding
Just keep on floating

Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
Stars and satellites, spinning round and round tonight
Shut your eyes, and feel the chemicals collide
And I feel so alive, spinning round and round
Won the night you saved my life
