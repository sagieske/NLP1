I'm one-thousand nigga I'm one-thousand n***a
I'm one-thousand nigga I'm one-thousand n***a
I'm one-thousand nigga I'm one-thousand n***a

Chorus:
I'm one-thousand nigga I'm one-thousand n***a
You can't tell me nun cause I done been through it all that's why when you
See me in these streets I'm hollering out I'm one-thousand nigga I'm
One-thousand n***a
Born in the gutter I done been through them wars that's why when you see me
In these streets I'm hollering out
I'm one-thousand n***a

Verse 1:
Bet you for the paint that why mines never bust
Done been under the gun and ain never told nun
Spooky ain't in me that's why I'm never shook
I'll take one for my homies if just that what it took
My heart don't pump Kool-aid it pump real blood
If I told you that I'm for ya  then that just what it was
Ain never been the one to sprang ya I'm the one you trust
Got a problem with one of my partners gotta kill the both of us
I'm riding for the call I'm loyal to the end
If it's bout one of my soldiers best believe I'm all in
When they had us in that jam I took one on the chin
I'm stiffer than the rest of em it is what it is
We down then we down and that just how I feel
Solid and authentic that just how I live
You can lie to me all you want but you ain't taking nun from me
Being a hunnit is a undastatment that's why I'm yelling

Chorus:
I'm one-thousand n***a I'm one-thousand n***a
You can't tell me nun cause I done been through it all that's why when you
See in these streets I'm hollering out I'm one-thousand n***a I'm
One-thousand n***a
Born in the gutter I done been through them wars that's why when you see me
In these streets I'm hollering out
I'm one-thousand n***a

Verse 2:
All of my life I was raised in the struggle
Whenever ain have it guess what I got it from the muscle
The thangs I done been through you can't tell me get no rougher
I told the D. A. To his face he'll never make me buckle
I'm one-thousand n***a you better act like you know it
I'm yelling out I'ma thousand boy cause I done been through it
Never have I ever hated on another man
Came up went down and came back up again
I'm one-thousand n***a talk it how I live it
And one thang about me I'ma live how I talk it
Whole hood knew I was broke but this ya last you saw that
If I swear it off with em 9 out of 10 I drug it
One-thousand n***a down to the gristle
And ran with the n****s that will find it off the ripper
If you came and slid wrong, you gone get ya issue
If you see me in the streets and you official holler out

Chorus:
I'm one-thousand n***a I'm one-thousand n***a
You can't tell me nun cause I done been through it all that's why when you
See in these streets I'm hollering out I'm one-thousand n***a I'm
One-thousand n***a
Born in the gutter I done been through them wars that's why when you see me
In these streets I'm hollering out
I'm one-thousand n***a
