Song:

I stood in the rain
Packed up and ready to go
My tears are falling again
Its because of you

Will you call me when you get there?
Will you miss me every day?
Cause i'll be waiting here at home
Till you knock on my door again

Baby, Please don't say goodbye
I love you too much
Just to let you fly
I need you to be my only one
Even if you're a thousand miles
Away from here
Away from here
