Song:

Every day, every night
I see your face in my mind
I will never hear your words again
I know, you left me but just for a while
I feel as if you were in our home
Death has taken you away from me
I feel your touch when I'm alone
I can't believe you're gone, I don't agree

Every day, every night
I see your face in my mind
I will never hear your words again
We'll meet on the other side
Every day, every night
I see your face in my mind
I will never hear your words again
We'll meet on the other side

It was a rainy day
The last time we joined our hands,
We were walking the same way
You left me alone, you left me alone
Here is the end of the world, you said so
You looked into my eyes no more
Here is that place where we can pray
And now I've got to pray for your soul

Maybe someday I'll be closer to you if I believe
If I believe
Maybe someday I'll be closer to you if I believe
If I believe
Maybe someday I'll be closer to you if I believe
If I believe
Maybe someday I'll be closer to you if I believe
If I believe

Every day, every night
I see your face in my mind
I will never hear your words again
We'll meet on the other side
Every day, every night
I see your face in my mind
My mind will never hear your words again
We'll meet on the other side
