Rapper style used by me, the B. I. G.
I put my key you put your key in, money we'll be seein
Will reach the fuckin ceiling, check, check it
My calico been cocked (uh-huh) this rap alfred hitchcock
Drop top notch playa hating won't stop (uhh)
This instant, rappers too persistant
Quick to spit biggie name on s**t, make my name taste
Like a** when you speak it, see me in the street
Your jewelry you can keep it, that be our little secret
See me, b that is, I that is, g whiz
Motherfuckers still in my biz

Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets

Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep

A first class ticket to lucifer, real name cristopher
