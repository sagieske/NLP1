Song:

(Ah, push it, ah, push it)

Free p***y, wind me down
I'm too much for these n****s
Free p***y, wind me down
I'm too much for these n****s

I ain't gotta run it, but I want one
So I ain't got time for your bullshit
First thing's first, gotta get me
I need more cheese like Rocky
These hoes gon' hurt, these nigga's gon' hate
But not me, I'ma do what we do
That truth, that heart, tall n***a
What about you?
Penny in the month(?)
That attract them clouds
Leotard like Snoop Dog
We love them hoes
One thing's for certain
Two thing's for sure
One monkey can't stop my shows
These n****s can't hold me down
One lady can't slow my rush
I know you left
I see why you kissed
Cause you ain't got swerve like this
Nah, you ain't got swerve like this
Call me Tenze Tenzo, A. K. A. Monty Moore
Look at me I'm good, everything is flawless

Y'all can't spend that dough
Y'all never spit that soap
That's that faith y'all can't have
Matter fact, take care that, grab that rope
That slope. I'm a bipolar, my b***h bisexual
She eat that p***y like vegetable
She just want green, cooking up eatables
Everyday I put her high on my schedule
Smoke until I cough, I love to break the law
I'ma stay in the streets
Your kids can find a truck
All the difference raw
Put it on the wall
Look it on the claps
Still the Underdog, yeah!

My daughter was like f**k you n***a
While the b*****s score some f*****g n***a
Yo b***h my b***h, yeah, we f*****g, n***a
Power in the crib, you know she run it, n***a

Yeah, so I hopped off that Porsche like f**k it
She's around this b***h, go get bucket, b***h
You love these hoes, man, quit fronting, b***h
And if it ain't est, it's not for me!

Free p***y, wind me down
I'm too much for these n****s
Free p***y, wind me down
I'm too much for these n****s
