Song:

We got together to turn the world around

Searchin' within us to find a new sound.
We climb high up to the sky
We don't wait and see

It's not a lie that we try to find the key.

You and I flyin' high
We climb high
High up to the sky.
You and I flyin' high

Once in a while we should try flyin' high.

We got together to turn from the ground

Searchin' for things nobody found.
We're working hard to climb up the wall

And we can't wait and see

'Cause after all we could fall and not see the key.
You and I flyin' high
We climb high

High up to the sky. . . .

Movin' together we feel the same

Time isn't wasted playin' the game.
All the high feelin' isn't a fame

You're flyin' high

We hope in our name

Once in a while we all
Should try flyin' high.

You and I flyin' high -
Yes
We're gonna make it -
We climb high
High up to the sky -
Yeah
Up to the sky -
You and I flyin' high -
Yes
We're gonna make it -
Once in a while we should
Try flyin' high.
You and I flyin' high
We climb high

High up to the sky. . . .
