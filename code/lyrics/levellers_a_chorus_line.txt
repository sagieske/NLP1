Song:

Seized and charged and don't you know it
You were caught for a crime But you didn't do it
These city walls that call you stranger
Your surprise local death will bring answers

(Is there) A chorus line wherever you go
Telling you you're right Messing with your reason
Clear blue skies wherever you go
Rivers of ice messing with your reason

Join the queue to stand in line
For second hand love and broken mind
Well the (?????) survivor knows it's time
When he's caught by a friend who's wading through wine

(Is there) A chorus line wherever you go
Telling you you're right Messing with your reason
Clear blue skies wherever you go
Rivers of ice messing with your reason
Director's words comfort you
Telling you you're right Messing with your reason

(Is there) A chorus line wherever you go
Telling you you're right Messing with your reason
Clear blue skies wherever you go
Rivers of ice messing with your reason
Director's words comfort you
Telling you you're right Messing with your reason
