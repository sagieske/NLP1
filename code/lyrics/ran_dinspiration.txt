Song:

It's 9: 42
I'm still playing with this beat
And my girl, she fell asleep
Oh God! She's so sweet

Now it's ten o'clock
I thought I'ma take her walk
We're gonna be walking in the park
And we'll be kissing in the dark

And I think we can
Make it our promise land
We'll be happy and
We'll live together till the end

[Chorus:]
And I hate to admit it, but I'm so in love with you
Well it's not secret anymore, I can't keep it anymore
And I hate to admit it, but I'm so in love with you
Well it's not secret anymore, I'm addicted to your love

Your love makes me high
Your love drives me wild
It makes me feel like I'm in the sky
Your love makes me cry

And I think we can
Make it our promise land
We'll be happy and
We'll live together till the end

(2x)

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

You gave me so much education
You gave me all the right direction
You gave me your love and affection
Because baby, you're my inspiration

[Chorus:] [2x]
