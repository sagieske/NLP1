Song:

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, for me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of losing
All of my happiness
For I love a girl
Who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, if your arrow
Makes her love strong for me
I promise I will love her
Until eternity

I know between the two of us
Her heart, we can steal
Help me if you will

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, for me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, can you hear me calling
Oh, I need you
Aim for my baby's heart for me

Cupid, please hear my cry...
