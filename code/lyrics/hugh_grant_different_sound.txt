Song:

Said, "Hey man, what's goin' on?"
's about time I'm movin' on
You keep on, on, on, on and on
So you'll stay, move and sing a song

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

I've seen you and your friends around
Your feet never touched the ground
You can't tell in this part of town
But you're jacked up, so keep it down

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

? Get up movin'?, girls and boys
You know some people got no joys
So just go with your inner voice
You get down and I'll bring the noise

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound

'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
'Cause you move to a different sound
