Song:

[1] I remember the time when I saw you
Standing there all alone in a crowd
I remember the time
Cos we drank too much wine

Chorus We all join hands
And we all join hands
So let's all join hands
Here and now

[2] All the girls getting kissed in the ballroom
All the boys Brahms and Liszt on the floor
I remember the time
When we sang Auld Lang Syne

Chorus are E P E A T[3] Have the time of your life when you're younger
Have the time of your life when you're old
Drink the wine, feeling fine
As we sang Auld Lang Syne

Chorus are E P E A T (2 times)

Here and now, here and now - yeah...
