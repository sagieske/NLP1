don't give a f k**what it is you, put it in and, I'ma smash it) (I
said no that's why don't, even ask again Keep
it up and find yourself f d****up just like your black friends) Yo

that's too much to ask you ain't got eyes to see this yet If
you ain't seen You?? just missed impressionism When
Dondi flicks rough as Van Gogh the lessons given (I
didn't ask you to express yourself give, up your cans kid) F
k**you Helen Keller I'll, hit the bricks you, hit the canvas [Chorus
