Song:

Yeaaa!
What Up baby
You an Astronaut Chick & that's The Only Thing That matter to me
You made me
On a whole another level, me & you we light the room up when we together
Anytime we having s** we got to break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
& we don't wanna go sleep to [?] with the high light and we go blast off
Like a rocket when the time right.

Ay yo style is impeccable you so f*****g incredible
You on top of a peddle school when you shine the vessels do
S** Ville Avenue, I'm tryna buy you the avenue
You an astronaut baby, everything we get is brand new
More water [?] me & you we some tycoons we light up a whole moon we high
Like mansions more love then February ain't no [?] the highest level you
Can go,
We blow up till we legendary
This out of space lingo I put it on when it's necessary
You a honor to me I got that [?] like trees
I wash my heart on my sleeve
You got my heart in my stomach
With out a dubt in my mind, I'm taking off & you coming

You an Astronaut Chick & that's The Only Thing That matter to me
You made me
On a whole another level, me & you we light the room up when we together
Anytime we having s** we got to break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
& we don't wanna go sleep to [?] with the highlight and we go blast off
Like a rocket when the time right.

Talked her into a pent house
On the rooftop popping bobbles
Shawty she go both ways anytime she go smash models
Addicted to the high life me & you we bout the same
Gucci Louie Prada When We Walking It Ain't No Thing
Got Them bbs Diamonds They don't Play Them Bithces Blang
Say you wanna go to Pluto me & you we are the same
Anytime we get together extra 5 to the flame
We was made for us to stay rocking who don't ride planes
Take off, take off, take off, take off & blast
You on some never competitive s**t, You in a whole nother class
You high sadiddy and pretty, lights, camera flashing
Focus on ya future and never disturb with the past

You an Astronaut Chick & that's The Only Thing That matter to me
You made me
On a whole another level, me & you we light the room up when we together
Anytime we having s** we got to break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
& we don't wanna go sleep to [?] with the highlight and we go blast off
Like a rocket when the time right.

She got the red on the bottom of her shoes
With a brain like, I can't loose
And It nothing for I can't do
And When I'm With Her, Ain't Got Nothing To Prove
She Accept Me For Me & I took you for you
We get higher than sky scrapers and past the moon
We got a special connection & we can light up a room... We some astronauts
Baby
No Cartoon, We Out Of here... And We Ain't Gonna Eva Come To Earth Again,
We Never Go Touch The Surf Again, Designer Gear is All We In,
Outerspace Status, The Most Incredible Bond And it's Full of Pasion
A whole lot of Pasion

You an Astronaut Chick & that's The Only Thing That matter to me
You made me
On a whole another level, me & you we light the room up when we together
Anytime we having s** we got to break a sweat, cause we some space cadets
& we don't wanna go sleep to [?] with the highlight and we go blast off
Like a rocket when the time right.
