Ft. Charl Henry

I know I really want you in my world
And baby it's for sure
I really need you as my girl
Come close, you're the only one for me
And this I know
You make it real hard to breathe

You make my heart drop
Higher than it non stop
I love it when you're on top
Baby you're so perfect to me
You got your hair done, got your nails fixed
And your style is so different from these other chicks
Baby you look good, and you smell good
When I see you all I think it is
I wish I could
In the day time, in the night time
Any minute is the right time
I can't leave it alone, baby girl you're all that I know

Girl slow, good girl that you happen to look incredible
I waited all the time you took now let's go
Together we are so inseparable
You make it real hard to live

You make my heart drop
Higher than it non stop
I love it when you're on top
Baby you're so perfect to me
You got your hair done, got your nails fixed
And your style is so different from these other chicks
Baby you look good, and you smell good
When I see you all I think it is
I wish I could
In the day time, in the night time
Any minute is the right time
I can't leave it alone, baby girl you're all that I know

Glasses up,... I feel you dude
You did your thing so well, I had to kill it too
Yankee blue cl make them look miserable
I got a few females I keep a listen to
Like I remember you, but you don't know me honey
Like my n****are killer say, where I know you from?
I pay for 2 so you owe me 1
A mandatory 3 got me scared of owning guns
Leave it to the... Keep it as the...
And in the studio I'm writing...
... We'll be eating soon, 3 sweepers on deck we don't need a room
Over 2 million views, they like... Shitting
He look like Shawn spitting, only thing he sound different
My money up so I don't mind giving
Heavy 9 lifting, yes it's just the life that I'm living

I wish I could
In the day time, in the night time
Any minute is the right time
I can't leave it alone, baby girl you're all that I know, yeah
