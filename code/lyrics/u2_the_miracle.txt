Song:

[Intro:]
Oooh oooh oooh oh~

Oooh oooh oooh~

[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere new your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectors that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the herd

I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard

Oooh oooh oooh~

[Verse 2]
We've got language so we can communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard

[Bridge]
We can hear, we can hear
We can hear, ooh~

Oooh oooh oooh~

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices may some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard

Oooh oooh oooh~

And your voices will be heard

Oooh oooh oooh~

And your voices will be heard
