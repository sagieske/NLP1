Song:

Fancy hotel rooms
Windows with a view
Staring into nothing
I thought I saw you
Your colours dancing in my mind
But they were only neon signs
Oh canada
I'm trying to find you
Will you wait for me.

There's people on the street
I know I'll never meet
I wonder what they're thinking
What their dreams are
But they just keep on walking by
I can see the questions in their eyes
Oh canada
You're a tree among towers
Just starting to climb
Please don't grow too quickly now
Don't leave us all behind

Pages of progress start to turn
Too quickly and the pages burn
Let's hope that we don't learn - too late
Let's hope it's never too late to learn
No don't let the madness wash you way.

Life keeps rolling by
Before it goes I'll try
To be stronger - to be wiser
Maybe just understand
What makes people fight to survive
While by themselves they slowly sigh

Oh canada -
Where are you going
Will you wait for me
Oh canada
I'm trying to find you
Will you wait for me
