Song:

[Translated]

You've been hurt so much;
Together, let's carry each other's incredible pasts;
Don't give up on living!

Whoa-
Whoa-
Give me your hand.

Will I end up losing you someday?
I want to protect you and your smile, so;
Even if the voice that calls to me is dying...
Even if the wind that follows along time disappears...

I will find you!

You've been hurt so much;
Don't say things like "I can't laugh" or "I hate people";
There's meaning in everything that happens in our lives;
So stay as you are for now, I know there'll come a time when you realize it.

Whoa-
Just like a rusted person.

Lying a top one another is futile;
You said you could live on your own;
Just with the usual kind words;
You ache to a point where;
I cannot reach you!

Whoa-
Your hand that I'm holding.

Whoa-
Long for casual gentleness.

Do you remember?

By leaning pain, you can become a person who can be kind to others.

Drive your life...

You've been hurt so much;
Don't say things like "I can't laugh" or "I hate people";
There's meaning in everything that happens in our lives;
So stay as you are for now, I know there'll come a time when you realize it.

[Beat-box]
Yeah-

How can I see the meaning of life;
It's disappearing, you're the only one.

Oh-
So you will not break, you distance yourself from me;
Don't say things like "I can't laugh" or "I hate people";
Now by and by, even if you cannot see, there's a meaning to everything;
Together, let's carry each other's incredible pasts.

You'd better forget everything, remember your different life...
You'd better forget everything, Remember though, we cannot return...

Whoa-
But as time goes by someday we'll understand each other.
