Song:

You always stir my imagination
Sometimes it borders on fantasy
And sometimes I find visions flash
Through my mind close to reality

Night, a soft guitar, a hidden lane
A moon and here and there a star
For a man and his dream
Night, a crickets' cry, a whispered word
A kiss and now and then a sigh

For a man and his dream
And their eyes when they meet
Seem to say it's sublime
And their hearts proudly beat

To a tune that is older than time
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love
So all the world will say
There's a man and his dream

And their eyes when they meet
Seem to say it's sublime
And their hearts proudly beat

To a tune that is older than time
Night must fade away and yet it leaves a love
So all the world will say
There's a man and his dream
