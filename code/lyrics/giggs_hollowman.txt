Verse 1
Burn a couple pricks
The second that I reach for the strap and the bottom bit merge with the clip
Lotta n****s wanna murda the kid
So I don't trust nobody and I persie my spliff
C*** back the work then I pitch M. O. B
I got no time to put my sperm in a b***h
Is it creme? Yes it certainly is
Rolling with my strap, on these nigga's in a peugeoty
Whip, when little pussies start things I don't wanna p***y clat loose nah fam I wanna p***y clat win
And I don't care if I aint gota strap on me,
If I gota knife, ima push apart skin
Keep the fuckin pumps in cabinets
Build a big boy spliff, no cig, Rasta manning it
F**k about fam I aint havin it,
Gun or Knife
F**k dah, ima buck or stab at it

Chorus

Verse 2
I made this movement on my own
And I don't owe no one s**t
Famalam I do my shooting on my own
A couple want to move in on my throne
Betta listen what I'm sayin
Cause it be kinda stupid if you don't
And I aint gotta prove s**t cause I know
The next n***a fucks with me he wont have no movement in his bones
Holla at my n***a on the phone
After I find out,
Where he keeps his bucky n his dough, I'm a skitso clappa
Pump hits your s**t goes splatter
And I'm feeling like s**t don't matter
Fam I'm old skool
Nigga's know me in the hood from the days,
When I used to mix down ragga
D-lo trappers
You nigga's aint seeing no cabbage
(Nar)
I'm sn1 ceo status
And I aint really feelin no rappers
You nigga's talking s**t (shit)
Well you can get your silly nose flattend

Chorus
N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)
N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)
N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)
N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)

N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)
N****r this is hollowman, (yeah hollowman)
