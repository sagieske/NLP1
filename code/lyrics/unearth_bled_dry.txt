Song:

The lines been drawn
The lines been blurred for far too long
The years have scaled frustration
How can you shine your shell with such profound pretension?
We have lost ourselves to self-contradiction
We have lost ourselves to the rise of opposition
The hand that leads and feeds you
Would we all still battle if this caved in beneath you
Weve done it on our own
All the years of bleeding
Weve done it all alone
Now you will bleed for me
Its a war
We have lost ourselves to our own lies
The bleeding intentions
This is the line I've drawn
This is your last chance
The is the lines I've drawn
Now you must bleed dry for me
Wars
This is the line I've drawn
The is your last chance
