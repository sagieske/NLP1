Feat. Bun B
[Chorus]
23 hour lockdown
Where they treat you like a ho
Slide you a plate up under the door
Nigga have to shit in the middle of the floor
Prison ain't a place that we need to go
So 'til they free Pimp C
I'ma leave up to U, G, O K K K
To keep it street
This one here for the street
This one here for the street
Life can be so hard
Shit can hurt so bad
Always have you sad
Constantly making you mad (Say Free Pimp C Free Pimp C!)
Life can be so hard (Free Pimp C Free Pimp C!)
Shit can hurt so bad (Free Pimp C Free Pimp C!)
Always have you sad (Free Pimp C Free Pimp C!)
Constantly making you mad

[D Roc]
In a lil bitty room where there ain't no light
Thinkin bout decisions, the wrong and the right
The dark and the light, the strong and the weak
Your conscious eatin at you trying to get your sanity
You gotta hold your ground
Can let it strip but htey your friends in the eatership but
Why they always dip?
Left you by yourself stuck up fucked up
Behind them bars, them times is hard
Thought you was smart
Now you losin'
Jumping around the room giving yourself a bruisin'
Trying all types of suicidal tactics
The people walk in and put you in strait jacket
Until they free Pimp C
I'ma leave it up to U, G, O K K K
To keep it street
That's why me and my brother
Got Bun B to bounce wit us on this beat

[Chorus]

[Kane]
23 hours lockdown in a cell
Can drive a nigga crazy as hell
Looking at four walls

Can do nothing at all
Got you feeling like a dog in a cage
A monkey on the rage
And the guard wanna spit in your face
Take your privilege away
But keep your head up son be brave
Don't let the worries of jail bring you down keep a focus head
And gain more knowledge instead
I know it's not where you wanna be
But take it from me I know everybody love to be free
So god dammit free Pimp C
I know he ready to hit the streets
And jumb back to makin beats
And I know that nigga miss Bun B
So we gon keep it on the G
That's comin for my brother and me
And we gon be here when you hit the streets
We waiting on the date that they free Pimp C

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
D-Roc let me put somethin on your brain
How would you feel if they locked up Kane?
Kane, how would you feel if they locked up D?
Well that's what the fuck happened to me
With Pimp C, my right hand
My best friend
My ace boom coom, man we closer than ken
We've been on the grind, holdin it down
Till he got caught up in some bullshit, that got him some time
Almost lost my mind, started drinkin a fifth a day
Couldn't understand why they was takin a pimp away (Why?)
We right on the edge, we bout to blow
And dependin where a cat in his position need to go
Sittin in the cell watchin time go pass
Lookin at your kids and your momma through a glass
If I could turn back time I would of told him keep the glock down
But now I pray for the day he may get out 23 hour lock down
