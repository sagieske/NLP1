Song:

Verse 1:
If you're in a valley, with a troubled min
I'm a mountain, come on and climb Because you look so good, to be so down
It won't take much girl, to turn it all around

Chorus:
Come with me, come with me
The feeling's free, just come with me
We'll get on a cloud girl, and ride it high
Say hello sun, as we sail by

Verse 2:
I'll take you where, you've never been before
Once we're there, you'll cry for more
If it's dark in your world, come walk in mine
My love's a light babe, it's on all the time

Chorus (x2).
