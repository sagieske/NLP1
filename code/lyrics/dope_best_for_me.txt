Song:

(I'm not) satisfied,
(But I'm done) apologizing,
(No more) compromise-
And no more compromising.
(Don't want) to criticize,
(Cause I've done) the best that I can,
(And I know) I'm doing fine,
So I don't really care what you think!

I got nothing to prove,
I got no one to please,
I do what's best for me!

(I don't) wanna fight,
(But I'm done) justifying,
(So no more) sacrifice-
And no more sacrificing.
(So go on) and criticize,
(Cause you're so) narrow minded,
(And I know) I'm doing fine,
So I don't really care what you think!

I got nothing to prove,
I got no one to please,
I do what's best for me!
Best for me!
I got nothing to lose,
Don't want nothing for free,
(Don't want nothing for free)
I know what's best for me!

(Solo1)

You think you know but you don't, know,
You think you will but you won't, know,
You think you know but you don't, don't, don't
You think you will but you won't!

I don't really care what you...
I don't really care what you...
I don't really care what you think!

I don't really care what you...
I don't really care what you...
I don't really care what you think!

I got nothing to prove,
I got no one to please,
I do what's best for me,
Best for me!
I got nothing to lose,
Don't want nothing for free,
(Don't want nothing for free)
I know what's best for me!
Best for me!

(Solo2)

I know what's best for me!

I got nothing to lose,
Don't want nothing for free,
(Want nothing for free)
I do what's best for me!
Best for me!
I know what's, best for me.
