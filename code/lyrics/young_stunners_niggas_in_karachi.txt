Mai akela tanha phiroon is jahan mai, apni dhun mai magan hun dus jaon kahan mai,
Meray gaon mai, sab thooktay mujh pr, kehnde kafir hai ye munda is nu nai rakhna gaon mai,
Har jaga bewaja kiya itna zaleel, menu kehnday si daleel, par karle yaqeen, shohrat pai inki chaon mai,
Kar maa ki izzat, jannat hai uskey paon mai,
Yeah...
