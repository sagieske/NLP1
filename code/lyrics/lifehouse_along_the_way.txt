Song:

Remember when the simple were the things we loved
Yeah yeah yeah
Remember when living was simply enough
Yeah yeah yeah
But fears fill the emptiness and years fill everything in between

All this time is passing by
All the way I've had to say goodbye
Oh my life begins today
After all, I've walked I've crawled I've loved along the way

Fly away into the sun, never return
Yeah yeah yeah
Stay awake forever watch this lifetime burn
Yeah yeah yeah
Peace breaks the loneliness and hope fills everything between.

All this time is passing by
All the way I've had to say goodbye
Oh my life begins today
After all, I've walked I've crawled I've loved along the way

Yeah yeah yeah
Walking down this road I've learnt to let go
Of what I know cos everything can change again
I'm on the edge of all that could be
Well what I can't control could control my dreams

Remember when the days we had never seemed to end
Yeah yeah yeah
Remember when we couldn't wait for life to begin
Yeah yeah yeah
All the answers I've found are away are few and far between

All this time is passing by
On the way I've had to say goodbye
Oh my life begins today
After all, I've walked I've crawled I've loved along the way
