Get back

Can you feel I'm not like you anymore.
I can't see,
I can't breathe.
See you quiver like the dogs on the street,
Looking down on as I beat you.
Oh, it's a bad religion,
From a broken nation.
Its a contradiction,
And I can't take it anymore, yeah.
Whos ta say I wont like you anyway?
Take a deep breath,
I'm alive.
Can you hear me,
I'm alive inside you.
Agony creeps up behind you.
Oh, it's a bad religion (Bad religion)
From a broken nation (A broken nation)
Its a contradiction,
And I can't take it any f***ing more
Its a bad religion (bad religion, bad religion, bad religion)
From a broken nation (Broken nation)
Its a contradiction.
Yeah.
Can you feel it?
I gotta live with it everyday
And I can't take the pressure.
I'm goin' insane,
Now go away

Go away

[Preacher:] Now you start praising God where ever you
Are. I don't care where you are, I don't care what is
Happening, just begin to praise God, just begin to
Praise him and praise him and praise him and praise
Him and worship him, and bless him... [Trails off]
