Song:

Ohhh... Yeah, yeah... Yea boy... Look a here...
Man, I done ten more lines than Etch-A-Sketch in my time
Better catch you fetchin' by nine; better blast your right mind
If soft makes you feel hard; hard makes you feel soft
Got a fifty, a pack of cigarettes, a brew and a cough
And I've been doin' this stuff from often to off and on
I've been face down all alone in the rain in the early mornin'
Next wife into alimony, it goes on and on and on it
Dog-gone it I've been on it so long I'm my only opponent
Should've know it, I know I had a ring but I had to pawn it
I had to hold it; I stole it off of the top of a toilet
From a friend, for my sins, fingerprints are in a folder
That the police holds; I get colder as I get older, y'all
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
My mother left me alone and I never met my dad
I've been abnormal since birth tryin' to wreck the pad
I've was raised by my Gramps since I was three years old
And all I ever wanted, was to be out of control
I made a clever disguise, became brilliant with lies
And pretended that I loved everything I despised
I worked hard to be liked and over did it at times
To much pressure to walk the line, so I committed some crimes
Dropped out of school in the ninth; ran into cooler than I
Had the weed, brews and pints and friends that love to fight
The fools that I beat-up and all the times that I got beat down
I got reputation always desired; now I'm tired
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
I'm always rhymin' on the break down; 'cause all I do is break down
When nobody's lookin', tears runnin' like greyhounds
My remedy is to clown, laugh and talk garbage
'cause what's really goin' on is the 18-wheeler of baggage
Imagine a whole lineage of illiage, drug-addicts and idiots, mental patients,
My family tree is straight insidious like it was water with alcohol
But I wouldn't have it any other way; I love y'all!
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
I don't want to live and I don't want to die
I just have to laugh 'cause I don't want to cry
