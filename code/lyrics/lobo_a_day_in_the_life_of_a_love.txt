Song:

Hey baby, you're a beautiful lady
But I guess that you know it
You sure turn my head around
And I'm sure that I show it

If you'll take the chance on romance
When this dance is over
Maybe we could slide away
To a quieter place

This could be a day in the life of a love
That could last forever
How could we ever know until we try
This could be a day in the life of a love

That could last forever
We'll surly make it last till morning light

What cha saw baby
Does it so to crazy
Well I just had to say it
When my heart speaks to me
I have to obey it

Why don't you say yes
And we'll make the best
Of the rest of the night

But then again
It might never end
