Song:

I hear you're taking the town again
Having a good time with all your time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life without you could never be right

As long as the stars shine down
From the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away
Loneliness found me, looks like it's here to stay
I know that I ought to find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinking of you

And as long as the stars shine down
From the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me

No matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this
I need your touch
You're the only one I'll ever love

As long as the stars shine down
From the heaves
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you getting over me
I'll never get over you getting over me
Never get over you getting over
I'll never get over you getting over me
