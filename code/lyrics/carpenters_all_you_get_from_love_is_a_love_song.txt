Song:

Like sailin' on a sailin' ship to nowhere
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin'
Love was washed away with the driftin' tide
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights
Just waitin' for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written
With a broken heart
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone, but not for me
Oh it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
That's got you layin' up nights
Just waitin' for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs are written
With a broken heart

(repeat)

Well it's a dirty old shame
(repeat)
