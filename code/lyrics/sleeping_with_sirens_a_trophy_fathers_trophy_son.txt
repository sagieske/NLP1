Song:

Father, father, tell me where have you been?
It's been hell not having you here
I've been missing you so bad
And you don't seem to care
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?

Do you even miss us?
Your bottles and mistress
I need to know, I need to know
Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did?
Did I make a mistake cause
I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
I will try to understand

Father, father, tell me where are you now?
It's been hell not having you
Last thing I heard, you were fed up, you're skipping town
With no note telling where
When I go to sleep at night, you're not there
When I go to sleep at night, do you care?

I need to know, I need to know
Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did?
Did I make a mistake cause
I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
I will try to understand

Why are you running away?

I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family? (x8)
It's been seven years wishing that you'd drop a line
But I carry the thought along with you in my mind
Is this what you call a family?
Is this what you call a family?
Family!

Why are you walking away?
Was it something I did?
Did I make a mistake cause
I'm trying to deal with the pain
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?

Why are you running away?
I don't understand this, is this how it ends?
Why are you running away?
Tell me please, tell me please, I need to know

Is this what you call a family? (x4)
