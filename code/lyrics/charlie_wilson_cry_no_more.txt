Song:

Sometimes your bridges get hard to cross I know,
Me I'm just taking mine one day at a time you know what I'm saying

I'm so alone, Help me Lord, things are getting rough,
No where to go, no where to turn, I've had about enough
Believe me now I don't know what to do why oh why
You never know, what's happened to me
So I get down on my knees begging you Lord to help me please,
Only heaven knows the pain I feel inside of me. Ow yeah,

Hear me out Lord,
I want to let you know
I don't have to cry no more, no no no
I found a friend yeah who will never let me down
I don't have to hurt no more, no no no no no
But help the child who's lost the love

Everytime, I try my best,
It seems I'm doing wrong, Oh yeah
When I think about, what I've done to me
I had to make a change oh yeah
Then you stepped in and turn my life around
I'm free again from the pain that I felt
And oh I need you Lord more and more
So I get down on my knees begging you Lord to help me please
Only heaven knows the pain I feel inside of me.

Hear me out Lord,
I want to let you know
I don't have to cry no more, Oh
I found a friend yeah who will never let me down
I don't have to hurt no more, no no no no no no no
You came to me that day I was standing in the rain
You stepped into my life when the storm returned again Yeah

I don't? Have to cry no more, no no no no no
I found a friend yeah, who will never let me down
I don't have to hurt no more, no no no no help me sing

Hear me out Lord,
I want to let you know
I don't have to cry no more, no no no no
I found a friend yeah who will never let me down
I don't have to hurt no more, no no no no
Hear me out Lord,
I want to let you know
I don't have to cry no more, no no no no

I found a friend yeah who will never let me down
I don't have to hurt no more, no no no no
No Crying
