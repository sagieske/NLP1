Song:

I hear a lot of records on the radio
A lot of love songs
They make me sing along
I sing straight from my heart right into yours
Complete with cliche and metaphor you heard before
It's ringin' in my head because it rings true
I know you're missin' me
Like I been missin' you
And I can never get enough
No never get enough of a good thing

Does the world really need another love song?
Another "you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone"
Another "I don't know if I can live without you"
Another "baby you, baby oh..." oh I don't think I'll ever know

I-I-I-I-I love you
Another love song
I-I-I-I-I do
Another love song

Time and time again we need a little break
From the give and take
We make the same mistakes
I know I've never been the one to let my feelings show
And I guess in that regard I'm really not alone
We could all use a push and when it comes to shove
We sing of life and love and a lack thereof
But with a little bit of luck we could never get enough of a good thing

Does the world really need another love song?
Another "you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone"
Another "I don't know if I can live without you"
Another "baby you..." oh I...

Does the world really need another love song?
Another "you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone"
Another "I don't know if I can live without you"
Another "baby you, baby..." oh I don't think we'll ever know

I-I-I-I-I love you
Another love song
I-I-I-I-I do
Another love song

My brown-eyed girl, give it away
Just give me some of that Marvin Gaye
Dobie Gray's a good place to start
Go ahead and take a little piece of my heart

So does the world really need another love song?
Another "you don't know how much I miss you when you're gone"
Another "I don't know if I can live without you"
Another "baby you, baby oh, baby ooh, baby..."
