Song:

Hey hey, I can't get enough, hey hey
Hey hey, I can't get enough, hey hey

You don't make it easy, you never keep it straight
But you're so damn s***, I can't keep away
I need your love, I need your skin
I need you baby to let me in

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up 'cause I can't get enough

It's alright, it feels good
When I'm in your chains, it's understood
That you're my owner, my only will
Come and get me while I'm quiet and still

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, don't you know
I can't get enough of you baby

Can't get enough of you baby
Never enough, do you want to give me some?
Can't get enough, don't keep me waiting
Never enough, hey hey, put it right here

I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Can't get enough of you baby
Never enough, do you want to give me some?
Can't get enough, don't keep me waiting
Never enough

It's alright, it feels good
When I'm in your chains, it's understood
And my soul confession, Devil's due
Come and get me girl, it's up to you

I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough, it's never enough
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Baby, give it up, don't you know

I can't get enough of you baby, come and get me
I can't get enough, I'm still hungry
Can't get enough
