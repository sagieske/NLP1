Song:

What are you calling me for
Thought it was over when you walked out the door Reminding me of the pain
That you caused
In my heart
No I'm not missing you at all
No I'm not trying to make you feel small
Lately it cuts like a knife
That you think you could walk right back into my life sooo..

[Chorus:]
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling me how you could hurt me that way
'cause it was hell getting over you
Damn you for what yoooou put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'cause I don't think my heart
Will let me love you again

Everything you said was a lie
Right to my face couldn't understand why
And how you could do me that way
And then walk back in my life
But tell me where were you when I couldn't sleep and where where you when I couldn't eat
And where you when I criiiiiiied
There's no way I could let you back into my life
Sooo....

[Chorus:]
You don't have to call
And we don't have a reason to talk
If you want something to say
Then start telling me how you could hurt me that way
'cause it was hell getting over you
Damn you for what yoooou put me through
The curtain's closed goodbye the end
'cause I don't think my heart
Will let me love you again

No we can not find a way
I don't have nothing to say
Baby I gotta be real
Guess now you know how it feels
Why are you wasting my time
Guess I been crossing ur mind
Can't let you back in my life
This is goodbyyyyyye

Repeat chorus
