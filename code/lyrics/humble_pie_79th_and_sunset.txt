Song:

Well this yellow haired snake sits snug as a bug
Got more angle than a toby jug
Star lock hair pins, honey has faults
Shows her legs when opportunity knocks
Underneath her red sweater
She's a big-deal go-getter
There'll be some dramas inside your pajamas tonight
Yer there's red eyed Ruby with her built up hips
She's got nut crushing boobs and jam tart lips
Says her angle is connections downtown L.A.
When you know she's just a hustler from the boys' brigade
Well she's the same old number
She just looks like your mother
There be salutations on you humble frillations tonight
She's young. She's wealthy, she's far from healthy
She does it up in Beverly Hills
She wears a foam back bra, she drives her Daddy's car
Has appeal to bend your will
Oh! Nymphomanic nimrod, thigh-high boots
Beat the hungry minions she planned
Keep on trucking--think of all the fun you had
Well you know there's such a lot of good ways to be bad
