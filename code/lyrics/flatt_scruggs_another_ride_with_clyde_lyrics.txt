Song:

Clyde Barrow told Bonnie Parker hon we're broke now so you better get your gun
Tell a driver put this Marmon in high you're gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew and the Barrow gang knew they're running for their lives
When they pulled out of town they didn't even touch the ground
Taking another ride with Clyde
[ dobro ]
Give me water Bonnie honey give me gas when we leave here we had better leave it fast
If the law comes gonna leave 'em high and dry gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew...
[ banjo ]
Bonnie said Clyde we had better lay low
We are trapped heres and there's no place to go
Clyde said girl this is no place to die you're gonna take another ride with Clyde
Oh the bullets flew...
I said taking another ride with Clyde
