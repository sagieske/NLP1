Song:

Are those your eyes
Is that your smile
I've been looking at you forever
But I never saw you before
Are these your hands holding mine
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind

For the first time
I am looking in your eyes
For the first time
I'm seeing who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When your looking back at me
Now I understand why love is, love is
For the first time

Can this be real
Can this be true
Am I the person I was this morning
And are you the same you
It's all so strange
How can it be
All along this love was right in front of me

Chorus

Such a long time ago
I have given up in finding this emotion
Ever again
But you live with me now
Yes, I found you somehow
And I've never been so sure, so sure

Chorus
