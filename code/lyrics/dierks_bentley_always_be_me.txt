Song:

(Dierks Bentley)

If lonesome was money I'd be set for life
I'd be swimmin in riches instead of tears I've cried
The blues would be worth a whole lot of green
You'd never hear one complaint from me
If lonesome was money I'd be set for life

If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone
I'd always have someone here to love me and to hold
I'd leave misery's clutches and find love's embrace
This frown you see a smile would replace
If lonesome was a woman I'd never be alone

Chorus
How I'd like to change lonesome
To mean something happy and free
But I know that won't ever happen you see
Lonesome will always be me
Lonesome will always be me

If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still
Bottle up my tears and let the folks drink their fill
It'd be happy hour all the time seven days a week
And laughter's all you'd ever hear from me
If lonesome was a liquor I could run a still

Repeat chorus x2
