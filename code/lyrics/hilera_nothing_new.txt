Song:

I never wanted to write
Something like this in a million year
But I'm here and I'll say it
And mean every word
And say that I

[Chorus:]
Feel numb
I feel weird
I feel like someone's going to get me
When I'm alone
It's typical I know but I feel dumb
I can't feel
Like another gum under your desk
I whine too much I know
It's typical I freakin' know

I never wanted to care
About this and everything
But it's here and I'll say it
I'll play every note
And say that I

(Repeat Chorus)

(Repeat Chorus)
