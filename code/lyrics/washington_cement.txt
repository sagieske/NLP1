Song:

So what I said is what I said
And what you said is what you meant
And when you left my house in the morning
You wrote your message on the cement
You put the letters and the numbers under people's feet
You took all the dealings and feelings and wrote them on the street

And everybody, everybody, everybody knows
And I went outside and I saw it I froze
You put my secret and your secret under people's feet
You remembered what I said and you wrote it on the f*****g concrete

So what we do is what we do
For me and you, not everyone
But outside in the night you were busy
Writing down what we had done
You seemed alright last night
But now I know that I was wrong

And everybody, everybody, everybody knows
And I went outside and I saw it I froze
You put my secret and your secret under people's feet
You remembered what I said and you wrote it on the f*****g concrete

And I guess you know how people talk
But it's only words and it's only chalk
And I'll feel better maybe
When we get some weather

And everybody, everybody, everybody knows
And I went outside and I saw it I froze
You remembered what I said and you wrote it on the street
No, no, no, no, no
I guess you know

But it's only words
And it's only chalk
Oh, it's only words
And it's only chalk

I guess you know how people talk
