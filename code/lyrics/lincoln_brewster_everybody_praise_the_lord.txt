Song:

I thank the Lord for what, for what He's done in us
I thank the Lord for His love
I thank the Lord for what He's gonna do in us
From the Heavens above
I thank the Lord for the smile that He's put on my face
I thank the Lord for His grace
I thank the Lord for the joy that He has given to me
'Cuz now I know that I am really set free

Chorus:
Everybody Everybody
Everybody praise the Lord
Everybody Everybody
Everybody praise the Lord
