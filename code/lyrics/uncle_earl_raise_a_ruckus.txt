Song:

Well, my old missus said to me,
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight,
When she died, gonna set me free
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight
Oh, come on children, come along,
While the moon is shining bright,
Get on the boat,
Down the river float,
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Well there ain't no use in me working so hard
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight,
When I've got a woman in the rich folks' yard
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Oh, come on children, come along,
While the moon is shining bright,
Get on the boat,
Down the river float,
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Well, every evening about half past eight
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight,
I'll hang my bucket on the rich folks' gate
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Oh, come on children, come along,
While the moon is shining bright,
Get on the boat,
Down the river float,
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Well she brings me chicken and she brings me pie
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight,
I eat some of everything the rich folks buy
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight

Oh, come on children, come along,
While the moon is shining bright,
Get on the boat,
Down the river float,
Gonna raise a ruckus tonight.

(Repeat)
