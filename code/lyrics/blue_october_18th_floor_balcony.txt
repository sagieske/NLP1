Song:

I close my eyes and I smile
Knowing that everything is alright
To the core
So close that door
Is this happening?

My breath is on your hair
I'm unaware
That you opened the blinds and let the city in
God, you held my hand
And we stand
Just taking in everything.

And I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach
And we're, we're trying so hard not to fall asleep
But Here we are
On this 18th floor balcony...
We're both flying away.

So we talked about mom's and dad's
About family pasts
Just getting to know where we came from
Our hearts were on display
For all to see
I can't believe this is happening to me and,
I raised my hands as if to show you that I was yours
That I was so yours for the taking
I'm so yours for the taking and
That's when I felt the wind pick up
I grabbed the rail while choking up
These words to say and then you kissed me... Here

And I knew it from the start
So My arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach
And we're, we're trying so hard not to fall asleep
But Here we are
On this 18th floor balcony...
We're both flying away

And I'll try to sleep
To keep you in my dreams
'Till I can bring you home with me
I'll try to sleep
And when I do I'll keep you in my... Dreams

And I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
And your head is on my stomach
And we're, we're trying so hard not to fall asleep
So here we are
On this 18th floor balcony...

Yeah
And I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach
No... We're not going to sleep, sleep
Here we are
On this 18th floor baclony...
We're both flying away.
