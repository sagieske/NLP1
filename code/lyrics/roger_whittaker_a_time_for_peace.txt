Song:

Snowflakes fall gently down.
We walk on to the distant sound.
Christmas carols on the wind.
Then Christmas feelings come again.
Strangers smile a warm: "Hello".
Angels in the virgin snow.
Children gather in the square.
The Christmas feelings people share.

A time for peace - a special time,
In the hope we may find.
Deep within every heart,
The love that very special kind.
A love to carry us along,
To carry it be on.
Christmas and the love that it gives,
The soul of every Christmas song.

Christmas rocks us gently now,
More then just a dream somehow.
May that feeling never end,
This Christmas feeling come again.

A time for peace - a special time,
In the hope we may find.
Deep within every heart,
The love that very special kind.
A love to carry us along,
To carry it be on.
Christmas and the love that it gives,
The soul of every Christmas song.

A time for peace - a special time,
In the hope we may find.
Deep within every heart,
The love that very special kind...
