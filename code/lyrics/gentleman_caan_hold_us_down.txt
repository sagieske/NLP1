You'll never see we wearing a frown (repeat)

I've been chanting Jah powers from morning
Truths and rights I man keep performing
I hear the Babylon bell how it alarming
Dem see a righteous ghetto youth and ready fi swarm him
Verse 1

When it blow the whole a dem hafi go calm king
Long time we did a issue 'bout the warning
We ago hold Lucifer and disarm him

And I know he is everywhere
Without Jah where would I be
And he is the one for me, you see

Well as the sun shine and the wind blow
That's how I know, That's how I know

Higher ground that is where I am going
Too bless to stress can't stop me from growing
