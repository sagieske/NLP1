There's Been A Lot Of Toasting, Lot Of Guys Hve Been Up To Her But She Told Them She Was Waiting, For The One That God Sent To Fulfill Her Kind Of Craving, A Special Kind Of Loving, One With love Dat Undastanding, Come Rain Come Shining, people Started 2 Say Dat She Wanted More Dan Mr. Rite, All Dat She Want Is A Man Dat Sees D Lite, Dey Say She's A Fool 4 Being Uptight, All Dat She Want Is Good love No Be Fight, Special Kind Of Girl Hard 2 Come By, this Kind Of Girl Na Him I Want 2 Make My Wife, you are D One, Say No More, Don't Bother About What D people Say, Cos I Say

[Chorus:]
Everytime Dat I Look Into Ur Eyes I See Fire In There(Fire), And If you Look Into My Eyes you See Desire In There(Desire), Gal If love Is Crime Den I Want 2 B Wanted, If love Is A Crime I'm Willing 2 B Hunted, Got A Lot Of Respect 4 you Cos Ur Kind Is So Rare(So Rare), It's Kind Of Hard 2 Imagine But I Know (you are Out There)2ce, If love Is A Crime Then I Wnt 2 B Wanted, If love Is A Crime I Wnt 2 B Hunted.
