Song:

They put us to work
The anvilbrigade
The angels lost track when
We started to fade
Believing is seeing you're seeming okay
It seems we lose our love
At the end of the rain
More than a fighting chance I've got
Seems like I'm losing out a lot
Maybe the sun still knows my name
I'll walk on my own to feet again
I'm just a clean cut individual
This ain't no second class residual
And from the bottom
I can feel you screaming
You turn your face to the rain
I see you smiling again
Maybe there'll be no more pain
The day we all go insane
They made us create they made us
Run farther they made us believe there
Was no one to bother
It feels like I'm old
It seems like I'm colder
She came in a box I loved
And I sold her
More than a fighting chance I've got
Seems like I'm losing out a lot
Maybe the sun still knows my name
I'll walk on my own to feet again
My body and brain this life I lead
Belongs to you I turn my
Face to the rain and see you smiling again
Maybe there'll be no more pain the
Day we all go insane
