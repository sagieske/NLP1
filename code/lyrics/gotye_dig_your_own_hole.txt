Song:

And you know it's the wrong way round
Still you can't say no
Ever playing upon your mind
But you won't say why

(So shut up!)
Unless you're ready to leave it
(Or make up your mind)
But you need it so much
(Do you really believe in it?)
Yes I do
From time to time

In the end
You dig yourself the hole you're in
When you don't know what you want
You just repeat yourself again
In the end
You just repeat yourself again
When you don't know who you are
You dig yourself the hole you're in

(Don't worry)
It's only in your mind
(Don't worry)
But I do
From time to time

You just repeat yourself again
(Don't worry)
You just repeat yourself again
(Don't worry)
You just repeat yourself again
(Don't worry)
You just repeat yourself again

Still it's the wrong way round
And you won't say no
Ever playing upon your mind
But you won't say why

(So shut up!)
Unless you're ready to leave it
(Or make up your mind)
But you need it so much
(Do you really believe in it?)
Yes I do, I do, this time

In the end
You dig yourself the hole you're in
When you don't know what you want
You just repeat yourself again
In the end
You just repeat yourself again
When you don't know who you are
You dig yourself the hole you're in

In the end
(Unless you're ready to leave it)
You just repeat yourself again
(But you don't know you need it)
When you don't know who you are
(Do you really believe in it?)
You dig yourself the hole you're in
