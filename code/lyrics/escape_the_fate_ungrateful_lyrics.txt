Song:

Trying to tear me apart,
Breaking me down to the bone
So listen closely,
'Cause what you don’t see
Is there’s still blood inside this beating heart

Still beating,
Still breathing
Falling from grace,
You laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

Rising again from the fire,
A Phoenix alive and inspired
You can’t erase me, won’t even phase me
No one hears a f*****g word you say

Still beating,
Still breathing
Falling from grace,
You laugh in my face
But you are the one who will leave with the beating

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound
With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

Stand and scream [4x]

[Guitar solo]

With bleeding hands I fight for a life that’s beat me down
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound
With bleeding hands I fight with the pride left in me now
Stand up and scream while the rest of the world won’t make a sound

With bleeding hands, these bleeding hands,
We stand up and scream while the rest of the world won't make a sound (stand and scream [4x])
