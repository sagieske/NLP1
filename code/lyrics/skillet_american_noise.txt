Song:

Angry words and honking car
Satellites and fallen stars
Distant dark blue radios that whisper down my boulevards
Ghosts and chains rattle in the attic
Broken headphone filled with static
Lonely room you’ve got nowhere to run

Three... Two... One for all and all for One

Times will be bad times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and some I wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You’ve got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise

Slammin' doors and cell phone rings
Hurricane force of silent screams
Don’t know what to believe
Bend the rule just to break it
You're so tired cus to got to fake it
But you just wannabe someone

Three... Two... One for all and all for One

Times will be bad times will be good
Things I wish I hadn't done and some I wish I would
Cutting through the American noise
You’ve got a voice and a song to sing (and a song to sing)
Drink deep in the morning
Drink deep in the morning
See what the day will bring

La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise

No matter who you are you’ve got a voice
Why don’t you use it
Sing your own song take all the noise
And make it into music

La da da da La da da da La da da daaaa
La da da da La da da da La da da daaaaaaa

La da da da lift up your voice
Let love cut through the American noise
La da da da you have a choice
Let love cut through the American noise

You’ve got a voice!

Let love cut through the American noise
