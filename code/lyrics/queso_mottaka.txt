Song:

When the moon shines, from the heavens above,
Life will be sweet, so green, and so young
Hemp will be ruling my brothers again
If you got the ganja, then pass it my friend

When the moon shines, from the heavens above,
Ife will be sweet, so green, and so young
I open my mind as I lie on the floor
Join me as we both live in ecstasy.

Dive in our heads and you'll see.

When the moon shines, from the heavens above,
Life will be sweet, so green, and so young
Hemp will be ruling my brothers again
If you got the ganja, then pass it my friend

When the moon shines, from the heavens above,
Ife will be sweet, so green, and so young
I open my mind as I lie on the floor
Join me as we both live in ecstasy.

Dive in our heads and you'll see.

Send me away...

While the song winds, I'd be bouncing around
I'd just be chilling and standing we ground
Opening the hearts of the people as we
Sing on melodies that makes us so free

While your mind flies, we'll be playing our song
Killing the buzz that we have all along
Toke up and dope up is all that we do
F**k it fool we never said that you should too

Dive in our heads and you'll see
