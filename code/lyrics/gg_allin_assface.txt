Song:

You think you're on my a** girl but that ain't you
It's the only thing that reminds me of you
All fat and ugly and covered with zits
When you open your mouth out comes s**t

[Chorus:]
Assface honey that's what you got
Sisyphus baby you can suck my c***
Assface (Yeah!) that's what I said
In place of a face you gotta a** instead

(Unknown) - where you don't belong
Gonna find some rope that's good and strong
Gonna hang you from the highest tree
We wont take no s**t you'll see

[Chorus:]

I'll get you back girl one way or another
Get away Merle she ain't got no brother
(Unknown) - somebody said
Because your neck is turning red

[Chorus:]
