Song:

When somebody loves you it's no good unless she loves you all the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you all the way
Taller than the tallest tree is that's how it's got to be
And deeper than the deep blue sea is now that's how deep it goes if it's real
When somebody needs you it's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years and through all the end between it come what may
Who knows where the love will lead us only a fool would say
But if you let me love you it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way
Darling all the way
(Who knows where the love will lead us only a fool would say)
But if you let me love you it's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way all the way
