Song:

I don't wanna be there when you're wrong
I don't wanna be there when you find out
I don't wanna be there when you break glass
And I don't wanna be there when they drag you out

You can't speak backwards
You can't save the animals

And I don't wanna be there when you're wrong
And I don't wanna be there when you find out
I don't wanna be there when you break glass
And I don't wanna be there when they drag you out
