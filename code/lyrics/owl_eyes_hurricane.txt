Song:

Hit me with your hurricane
Hit me with your hurricane

Come the night, falls the darkness
Can you feel it? Don't you know?
And my mind starts dreaming
Of a place where we will go

And I don't ever feel right here
When you're racing with the gods,
Breaking through my guards.
I don't ever feel right here
When you chase me with your guns,
Chase me with their guns.

When you hit me like a hurricane,
Oh the sirens come, the sirens come
Yeah you get me more than I can take,
Oh the silence goes, the silence goes.
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane

Through the stars light will shine
I can feel it, I can feel it.
I'm at the edge of a start,
I know it's coming when I'm alone.

I don't ever feel right here
When you're racing with the gods,
Breaking through my guards.
I don't ever feel right here
When you chase me with your guns,
They chase me with their guns.

When you hit my like a hurricane,
Well the sirens come, the sirens come
Then you get me more than I can take
Oh the silence goes, the silence goes.
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane.
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane.

Count all the times you feel it all
With all your soldiers at my door, door.

When you hit my like a hurricane,
Well the sirens come, the sirens come
Then you get me more than I can take
Oh the silence goes, the silence goes.
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane.
Hit me with your hurricane,
Hit me with your hurricane, cane.
