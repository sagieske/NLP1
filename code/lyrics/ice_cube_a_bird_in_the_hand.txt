Song:

(big bird: sesame street)
Hey look at this! I was cleaning out my nest
And I found a book of my old poetry

(ice cube)
Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad
Gots to get a job 'cause I was a high school dad
Wish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation
But that's not likely, so here's my application
Pass it to the man at at&t
'cause when I was in school I got the A. E. E.
But there's no S. E. For this youngsta
I didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the
Back like a slave, that's what be happenin
But whitey says there's no room for the african
Always knew that I would boycott, jeez
But welcome to mcdonalds can I take your order please
Gotta sell ya food that might give you cancer
'cause my baby doesn't take no for an answer
Now I pay taxes that you never give me back
What about diapers, bottles, and similac
Do I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack
For decent shelter and clothes on my back?
Or should I just wait for help from bush
Or jesse jackson, and operation push
If you ask me the whole thing needs a douch
A masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood
To the whorehouse b*****s,
Miss porker, little joe or todd bridges
Or anybody that he know
So I got me a bird, better known as a kilo
Now everybody know I went from po' to a n***a that got dough
So now you put the feds against me
Cause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency
I'm never givin' love again
'cause blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican
Now I remember I used to be cool
Till I stopped fillin' out my w-2
Now senators are gettin' hired
And your plan against the ghetto backfired
So now you got a pep talk
But sorry, this is our only room to walk
Cause we don't want a drug push
But a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush
