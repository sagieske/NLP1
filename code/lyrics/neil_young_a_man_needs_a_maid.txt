Song:

My life is changing
In so many ways
I don't know who
To trust anymore
There's a shadow running
Thru my days
Like a beggar going
From door to door.

I was thinking that
Maybe I'd get a maid
Find a place nearby
For her to stay.
Just someone
To keep my house clean,
Fix my meals and go away.

A maid. A man needs a maid.
A maid.

It's hard to make that change
When life and love
Turns strange.
And old.

To give a love,
You gotta live a love.
To live a love,
You gotta be "part of"
When will I see you again?

A while ago somewhere
I don't know when
I was watching
A movie with a friend.
I fell in love with the actress.
She was playing a part
That I could understand.

A maid. A man needs a maid.
A maid.

When will I see you again?
