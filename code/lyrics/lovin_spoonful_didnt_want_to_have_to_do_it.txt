Song:

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to break your heart
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' from the very start
But you kept on a-tryin'
And I knew that you'd end up a-cryin'
And I knew I didn't wanna have to do it at all

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "The end"

Was a time that I thought our love could fly
and never never fall
Why should I suppose we were never really meant
to be close to each other at all
No, I...

Didn't wanna have to do it
Didn't wanna have to be the one to say it
Didn't wanna have to do it
I kept a-hopin' there'd be somethin' to delay it again
Yeah, but then
No, I didn't wanna have to be the one to say "The end"
No no, not the end, no no no
