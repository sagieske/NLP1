Song:

Buy a litre of Fabulon
Dare we spray down
In the scorched trail
Of a Sunbream iron

Paint your face with Revlon
To hide your frown
In the blue gloam glare
Of your Rank Television

Carry it away from Myers now
Requiring of us a lon
How can we live without these things
In Templestowe

Buy an electric toothbrush for your mouth
Roche medication for your heart
You'll be comfortable locked uptight
In your sauna

Let the third world rabble on
If dishwasher breaks down
An eyeful of Visine
A floral tissue to cry on

In the valley of Silicon
Where we may drown
And there we leapt
Into blind oblivion

Carry it away from Tandy now
A computer of your own
How can we live without a vdu
And a life programme

A bottle of Listerine for your mouth
A pair of Adidas for your heard
You'll be comfortable locked uptight
In your wardrobe

Buy a litre of Fabulon
Dare we spray down
In the scorched trail
Of a Sunbream iron
