Song:

Outside there's children laughing
The radio plays my favorite song
The sun is shining
I am peace broke out in the world

And no one says a cruel word
And peace is the sweetest sound
I've ever heard

And baby's coming back to me
Oh baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

He was just sleeping somewhere
And now he has come to hold my hand
And we go walking

And the years have all fallen away
And I remember you like yesterday
And the summer's here
So say goodbye to rain

And baby's coming back to me
Oh baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
My baby's coming home

I feel like I am surely dreaming, ahahaha
How can things oh so quickly change?
Yeah, it's strange but

Oh baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Oh, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming home

Oh, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, baby's coming back to me
Oh, baby's coming back to me
Yeah, my baby's coming home
