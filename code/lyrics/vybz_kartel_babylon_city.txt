Song:

Babylon city haffi fall
Way too much ghetto youth madda mi see bawl
Politician nuh gi wi nothin at all
Dem time soon come check da clock deh pon di wall
Ghetto youth, dem wah see we crawl
But jus like Dunns River blessing haffi fall
Police man kill out di dancehall
Nuff youth weh go school, dem madda have a stall

[Chorus:]
Ghetto youth naw stop try
Blood sweat and tear on di black soil
Mr Chin family done rich already
Where is the love for the black child
Suh we hustle in the street, hustle in the street
Youth haffi go school, food haffi eat
Suh we hustle in the street, hustle in the street
Dats the way the garrison a dweet
Society, neva provide a betta way for you and me
Suh we hustle in the street, yuh see it suh we hustle in the street (mhmmm)

Tell mi wah next dem a go try
Employment suh low, and di price dem suh high
Jus like the desert a suh mi pocket dry
A grand inna mi billfold a weh dat a go buy
Dats why dem build di embassy wall high
Cause dem know every youth want a visa fi fly
Marcus high-high, highly Selassi-I philosophy
Dat mi wah fi see
Scully

[Chorus:]
Ghetto youth naw stop try
Blood sweat and tear on di black soil
Mr Chin family done rich already
Where is the love for the black child
Suh we hustle in the street, hustle in the street
Youth haffi go school, food haffi eat
Suh we hustle in the street, hustle in the street
Dats the way the garrison a dweet
Society, neva provide a betta way for you and me
Suh we hustle in the street, yuh see it suh we hustle in the street (mhmmm)
