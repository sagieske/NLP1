Song:

Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling it won't be long before it's crying time

They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
But my love for you could never grow no stronger if I live to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again...
[ steel ]
You say you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again...
