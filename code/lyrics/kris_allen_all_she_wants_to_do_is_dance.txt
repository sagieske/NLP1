Song:

They're pickin' up the prisoners and puttin' them in the pen
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Rebels been rebels since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
They mix 'em up right in the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' 'round with blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
Wild-eyed pistols wavers who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is, all she wants to do is dance

And make romance
She can't feel the heat, 'comin off the street now
She wants to party, she wants to get down
And all she wants to do is, all she wants to do is dance

The government bugged the men's room in the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
To keep the boys from sellin' all the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys from makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance
They still can sell the army all the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is, all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat, 'comin off the street now
She wants to party, she wants to get down
And all she wants to do is, all she wants to do is dance

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat, 'comin off the street now
She wants to party, she wants to get down
And all she wants to do is, all she wants to do is dance
