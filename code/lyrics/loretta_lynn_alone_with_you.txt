Song:

How I love to be around you when the lonely night surrounds you
How I love to be alone with you
How I love to have the power to read your mind one hour
How I love to be alone with you
Just to be with you one night you and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight have you for my own
This would be a joy unending could be a real beginning
How I love to be alone with you
[ ac.guitar ]
How I'd love to be around you when the lonely night surrounds you
How I love to be alone with you
If I only knew for certain I'd cut out all my flirtin'
How I love to be alone with you
Just to be with you one night...
How I love to be alone with you how I love to be alone with you
