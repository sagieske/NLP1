Song:

Hold it down, boy
Don't lose your head
You're so inviting
And I'm easily led

Leave a message
'Cause you know that
I'll be tired and low
Tired and low

And I wish I could see you
I cross over seas
And I wish I could be with you
But I'll always believe

I gotta hold it down, don't let it show
Hold it down so you don't know

And I know you're letting go
But this is good advice, good advice

And I wish I could see you
I cross over seas
And I wish I could be with you
But I'll always believe

I gotta hold it down, don't let it show
Hold it down so you don't know

And I know you're letting go
But this is good advice, good advice

And I wish I could see you
I cross over seas
And I wish I could be with you
But I'll always believe

And I wish I could see you
I cross over seas
And I wish I could be with you
But there's so much I do

But you're so far
You're so far
You're so far
You're so far away
You're so far away
