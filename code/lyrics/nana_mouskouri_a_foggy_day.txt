(Damsel In Distress, A)

[Verse:]

I was a stranger in the city.

Out of town were the people I knew.

I had that feeling of self-pity:

What to do? What to do? What to do?

The outlook was decidedly blue.

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

[Refrain:]

A foggy day in London Town

Had me low and had me down.

I viewed the morning with alarm.

The British Museum had lost its charm.

How long, I wondered, could this thing last?

But the age of miracles, hadn't passed,

For, suddenly, I saw you there --

And through foggy London Town

The sun was shining ev'rywhere.
