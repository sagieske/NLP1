Song:

I'm calling from the station and I haven't got much time to let you know
Got a ticket for Misoury and there's things I need to say before I go
If I could I'd have you meet me but I don't see how I can
I don't have enough to pay your fare
There's a factory in Columbus hiring now I understand
And they're looking for an able bodied man
You should meet some money in the letter that I mailed two days ago
But when I wrote the letter saying you could come to me I didn't know
And I was goin' to lose my job in such a little while
So now we're gonna have to change our plan
They may not hire me in Columbus but I'm pretty sure they will
Cause they're looking for an able bodied man
[ steel ]
If I'd've more education now I'd've made a better life for me and you
But just simple manual labor is the only kind of work that I can do
The bus is loadin' for Misoury so I guess I'd better go
I'll call you just as soon as I can
I'll be sending you a ticket cause I think I'll get a job
If they're looking for an able bodied man and remember I'm your able bodied man
