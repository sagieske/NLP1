Song:

Wait another minute.
Can't you see what this pain has f*****g done to me.
I'm alive and still kicking.
What you see I can't see and maybe
You'll think before you speak.

[Chorus:]
I'm alive. For you,
I'm awake. Because of you,
I'm alive. I told you,
I'm awake swallowing you alive!

Take another second.
Turn your back on me and make believe, that
You're always happy.
It's safe to say you're never alive.
A big part of you has died and by the way,
I hope you're satisfied.

I'm alive. For you,
I'm awake. Because of you,
I'm alive. I told you,
I'm awake swallowing you alive!
For you, I'm awake
Because of you,
I'm alive. I told you I'm awake.

Tearing it back unveiling me.
Taking a step back so I can breathe.
Hear the silence about to break.
Fear resistance when I'm awake.

Tearing it back unveiling me.
Taking a step back so I can breathe.
Hear the silence about to break.
Fear resistance when I'm awake.

Alive for you.
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, I told you
I'm awake swallowing you
I'm alive, I told you
I'm awake
Because of you
I'm alive, I told you I'm awake

Swallowing you alive
