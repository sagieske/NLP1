"Cornflower Blue"
-Eric Bogle

Cornflower blue, bloomin' in the mornin' sun
Tiny flowers that grew, from when our love had just begun
Long ago we planted, each dry and dusty row
How long has it taken, for the seeds of love to grow?
Cornflower blue...

Cornflower blue, like the faded shirt you wore
Standing in the shadows, when I opened up the door
The smile in your eyes, when you said hello
Held me so tenderly, and you would not let me go
Cornflower blue...

Cornflower blue, deeper than the evenin' sky
Peaceful as a river, bluer than goodbye
Blue like a diamond, when the light shines true
If love came in colors, then I'd choose this one for you
Cornflower blue...
Cornflower blue...
