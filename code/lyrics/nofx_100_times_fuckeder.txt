Song:

Fighting with gloves
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Hitting above the belt
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Citing the facts
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Exposing all the lies
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder

We get what we f*****g deserve
Bringing raised fists to a knife fight
You'd think developed minds could learn
Not to give benefit of doubt
You wouldn't trust a hungry animal
Around your newborn, would you?

Sharing the wealth
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Taking the high road
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Showing respect
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder
Giving a s**t
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder

Did anyone really expect
To win a race already fixed
The spoils doled out in advance
The appointed already picked
All allegations of fraud
Categorically dismissed as absurd
