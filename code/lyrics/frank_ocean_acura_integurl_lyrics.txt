Song:

[Verse:]
She singing b***h I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and mjg, yeah

[Bridge:]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Verse 2:]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah
