Song:

It's a mystery night
Like a sawed-off shot gun
In the morning light it comes to anyone
All the strings that follow you
And the things they're tied to
My love's behind you colored by the snow
The shine is gone

I used to know what made you wet
Now I'm searching for it
Cause it's a mystery all the same
Not to get you back

On holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"
I could be happier

It's a mystery night
And I thought we had fun
But in the morning light
Your cars already gone

Do the things I wanna do
Not the ones I'm supposed to
Why can't I get close to
The man I saw in me
When I was young

On holiday
With a broken camera
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"
And all I say
Is "I could be happier"

Higher up away
I'm free of all the shadows that follow me
Follow the branches up to break
With all my faith
Destiny and fate
Cause I never wanna go away tonight
The cameras, cameras
I never wanna open up my eyes
The cameras, the cameras

Your cameras
Your cameras

Cause I never wanna go away tonight
I never wanna open up my eyes
