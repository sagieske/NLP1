Song:

(Chorus :)
Am I right
Am I wong
Am I weak or strong
Cant you see I am burning alive
Hold me tight trough the night
And I feel alright
And I know I am right
I met you once when the sun came up
The road to nowhere
When I had a rest
I met you once where the river flows
From the hills of the east to the west
(Chorus 1x)
You came to me and I turned to you
You spoke to me like a man should do
I caught a glance of a burning eye
And I knew that my dreams will come true
(Chorus 3x)
I know I am right
