Song:

He's cool, he's hot like a frozen sun.
He's young and fast, he's the chosen one.
People, we're not bragging,
He's the American Dragon.
He's gonna stop these enemies with his dragon power,
Dragon teeth, dragon tail, burning dragon fire,
A real live wire!

American Dragon,
American Dragon,
He's the American Dragon, (break down with the dragon!)

His skills are getting faster with Grandpa the Master,
His destiny will walk up streets, showtime, baby, for the legacy!

American Dragon,
American Dragon, from the J to the A from the K to the E
American Dragon, he's a magical protecter from the nyc
American Dragon, yow!
