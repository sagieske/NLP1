Song:

Got what I wanted
Now I don't know
I dream we're falling
And there's nothing below
When I woke today
Found you'd run away
I should have warned you
That this house is haunted
There's nothing left to say
Still I watch your shadow play
Hey...

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you

I scale the wall
The engines stall
I dream we're flying
While the sky is falling
Still you're moving in
Under my skin

Guess I should warn you
That this house is haunted
And though I look away
You know I watch your shadow play
Hey...

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you

Whispers on a shelf
Whispers to myself
Whispers all I know
Whispers of a ghost

Saw what I saw
Know what I know
You feed the fires in my
Mountain of snow
When I close my eyes
Feel the red sun rise
Set a fire this morning
To perform our last goodbye
Though so fast I turn away
You know I watch your shadow play
Hey...

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love for you
Ooh you don't forget my
No you don't forget my love
For you
Don't forget my love for you
