Song:

Come clean and off with your head
The streams of bright rosy red
Your heart will do the rest
And you'll always fade
You'll always fade
Someday you'll change
But you'll always fade
Cut free the weight on your neck
The screams, the clutching of breast
So sorry bout the mess
But you'll always fade
Someday you'll change
But you'll always fade
