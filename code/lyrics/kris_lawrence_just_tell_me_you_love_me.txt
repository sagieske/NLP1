Song:

Many times, I wished you were here,
Through the velvet shadows of my dreams
Many times, I wished you were near,
Through the darkness as it came but it seems
That you, you never said what I needed to hear
Just tell me you love me,
Whisper words I so long to hear
Let this time not be borrowed
Let it be ours to share,
If you tell me you love me
It would lead a way to your heart
Through the mirrors of silence, you love me
Quietly, I've waited,
For the memory born of our first kiss
Patiently, I've waited,
For the moment you would take me to word
That I, I've never seen that world before
Just tell me you love me
Whisper words I so long to hear
Let this time not be borrowed
Let it be ours to share
If you tell me you love me
It would lead a way to your heart
Through the mirrors of silence, you love me, you love me
