Song:

On the day that we met
I awoke from a total sleep
You said
Keep your eyes open wide
And keep your arms open wide
You brought me courage
You bring me courage
To keep my eyes open wide
And keep my arms open wide
You brought me courage

You show
A kind of delight
Dancing 'round
Like a dragonfly
Like a coverlet in the summer's air
In the summer's air
In the summer's air

On the day that we met
I awoke from a total sleep
You said
Keep your eyes open wide
And keep your arms open wide
You brought me courage
You bring me courage
To bring my eyes open wide
To keep my arms open wide
You bring me courage

You wrap your curve of delight
Round my cold cold neck
You're a coverlet
In the summer's air
In the summer's air
In the summer's air
