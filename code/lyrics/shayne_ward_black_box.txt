Song:

Sending out a mayday
We're going down
Nothing we could have done
Would have turned it around
Everything we had scattered everywhere
Searching through the wreckage of a love affair... 

You got something to say
Say it to me
Not everyone else
You say that I'm to blame
My words are in vain
Don't go fooling yourself... 

There's a little black box here
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us (yeah)
There's a little black box
A record of emotions
Everything that ever was (yeah)... 

You may deny it
But when I find it
I'm gonna play it out loud to the world
There's a little black box, yeah
There's a little black box, yeah... 

There's a lot of pressure when you get deep
You left me on my own at six hundred feet
I was looking 'round for a little help
But everyone was looking out for themselves... 

You got something to say
Say it to me
Not everyone else
You say that I'm to blame
My words are in vain
Don't go fooling yourself (oh)... 

There's a little black box here
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us (yeah)
There's a little black box
A record of emotions
Everything that ever was (yeah)... 

You may deny it
But when I find it
I'm gonna play it out loud to the world
There's a little black box, yeah
There's a little black box, yeah... 

You can't stop a true survivor
You'll discover that out on your own
'Cause I'm a true survivor
And I'll be here after you're gone
Long after you're gone
Long after you're gone... 

There's a little black box here
Somewhere in the ocean
Holding all the truth about us (yeah)
There's a little black box
A record of emotions
Everything that ever was (yeah)... 

You may deny it
But when I find it
I'm gonna play it out loud to the world
There's a little black box, yeah
There's a little black box, yeah...
