Song:

[are Kelly Speaks]
Yo C, You know we need to go out and do somethin' man
Got all these hot cars and hot cribs
Ain't got nobody to share it with, baby
Know what I mean? Let's go

[Charile Wilson]
[Chorus:]
Hey girl, How you doin'
My name is Charile, last name Wilson
I was wonderin' if I could take you out
Show you a good time, invite you to my house
Here is my number, girl you can call me
And don't forget it baby, the name is Charlie

[Verse:]
With all of this fortune, what am I doin' single
Sometimes I tell myself, "Man, get out and mingle"
You don't have to be alone, you need someone to love
But bein famous sometimes it's hard to find someone to trust
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Being in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well, yea

[Chorus:]
Hey girl, How you doin' (How you doin')
My name is Charile(Charlie),
Last name Wilson (Last name Wilson)
I was wonderin' (Wonderin', yea)
If I could take you out (Take you out)
Show you a good time,
Invite you to my house (Here's my)
Here is my number (My number baby),
Girl you can call me (Call baby)
And don't forget it baby (Don't forget, no),
The name is Charlie (Charlie)

[Verse 2:]
Now, I ain't got nobody to ride in my new Coupe with
Ain't even got nobody to chill with on the weekend
This is just a house, until someone makes it a home
Love don't count me out, 'cause I'm so all alone
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself
Bein' in love is good for your health
It's time to share this fortune and fame with someone else
Now that I'm in this club, I might as well

[Chorus:]
Hey girl (Hey girl),
How you doin' (How you doin')
My name is Charile (Charlie)
Last name Wilson (Whoa Whoa)
I was wonderin (I was wonderin, yea)
If I could take you out (Take you out)
Show you a good time (Invite you)
Invite you to my house (Here's my number)
Here is my number
Girl you can call me (and don't forget it baby)
And don't forget it baby (Charlie)
The name is Charlie
(ohhhh ohhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohhh oh oh oh yea, shoo ba doo woop dwee)

[Bridge:]
Now the reason that I left is because (It feels like I know you)
Aw, This must be one hell of a (Deja Vu)
Haven't I seen you somewhere before? (And I kno you heard this somewhere else)
And how I want you girl for sure
And that's why I'm introducin myself, yea

[Chorus:]
Hey girl, How you doin'
My name is Charile (First name Charlie)
Last name Wilson (Last name Wilson)
I was wonderin' (I was wonderin')
If I could take you out (If I could take you out)
Show you a good time (Show you a good time)
