Song:

Why does she make sure to be so immature

About these things, I don’t want you to change around it

And sometimes love will end and all will be forgotten then someday we will
Laugh about it.

And you say, that Its alright and I know, that it’s a lie

From the black in your eyes

You don’t have to do this on your own, Like there’s no one that cares about
You

You don’t have to act like your alone, like the walls are closing in around
You

You don’t have to pretend no one knows, like there’s no one that
Understands you

I’m not just some face you used to know, I know all about you

(woo)

And you should know that someone cares about you, I know all about you

Here I am still holding on you’re finding ways to break the bonds, they’re
Stronger than you realize

You could say that I’ve not tried, I’ve let you down, left you behind but
You’re the one who’s saying goodbye

And you say, that Its alright and I know, that it’s a lie

From the black in your eyes

You don’t have to do this on your own, Like there’s no one that cares about
You

You don’t have to act like your alone, like the walls are closing in around
You

You don’t have to pretend no one knows, like there’s no one that
Understands you

I’m not just some face you used to know, I know all about you

(woo)

And you should know that someone cares about you,

(woo)

I know all about you

(woo)

And you should know that someone cares about you

(woo)

I know all about you

And you say, that Its alright and I know, that it’s a lie

From the black in your eyes

(woo)

Here I am still holding on you’re finding ways to break the bonds, they’re
Stronger than you realize

And you could say that I’ve not tried, I’ve let you down, left you behind
But you’re the one who’s saying goodbye

And you don’t have to do this on your own, Like there’s no one that cares
About you

You don’t have to act like your alone, like the walls are closing in around
You

You don’t have to pretend no one knows, like there’s no one that
Understands you

I’m not just some face you used to know, I know all about you

I know all about you
