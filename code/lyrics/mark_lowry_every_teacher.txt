Song:

Never on the honor roll 
But I think that I should mention 
I would have a masters now 
If they gave it in detention 

Shot spit wads till I turned blue 
And flew paper airplanes too 
My chemestry experiment 
Blew up the whole school, by accident 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
I brought prayer back to class 
Cuz all my teachers prayed that I would pass 

At the mention of my name 
Teachers twitch, and some start droolin 
A diploma was my aim 
But I even flunked home schooling 

Put a frog down one girl's back 
My mama got notes by the stack 
All of my teachers got combat pay 
Every hour, every day 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
So many swats that I couldn't keep score 
That's what I grew all this padding for! 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
I brought prayer back to class 
Cuz all my teachers prayed that I would pass 

Yeah, sure, maybe I drove them mad 
And was the worst student they ever had 
But they are getting their just deserts 
I talk about them at my concerts! 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
I can't recall all those words that they spoke 
"Mark, your life's gonna be a joke" 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
So many swats that I couldn't keep score 
That's what I grew all this padding for! 

Every teacher knows my name 
they hear it and go insane 
I brought prayer back to class 
Cuz all my teachers prayed that I would pass
