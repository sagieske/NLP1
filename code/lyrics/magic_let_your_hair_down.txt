Song:

De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom
De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom
De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom
De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom

There she goes, there she goes, there she goes
There's nothing better than my beautiful woman
Even though, even though, even though
It's not always effort, we still fly together

To me you are more than just skin and bones.
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know

So come on and..
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Said go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You ain't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down

De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom
De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom
De-ah-boom-boom-boom-boom

Tell me when, tell me when, tell me when
When I can steal a, a sweet kiss right from you
I'm diving in, I'm diving in, I'm diving in
The water's warm right here, here

To me you are more than just skin and bones.
You are elegance and freedom and everything I know

So come on and do it
Baby let your hair down
Let me run my fingers through it
We can be ourselves now
Said go ahead, be foolish
No one's on the clock now
Lying in this simple moment
You ain't gotta worry now
Just let your hair down
