Song:

You say love is what you put into it
You say that I'm losing my will
Don't you know that you're all that I think about?
You make up a half of the whole

You say that it's hard to commit to it
You say that it's hard standing still
Don't you know that I spend all my nights
Counting backwards the days 'til I'm home?

If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home

I say that we're right in the heart of it
A love only we understand
I will bend every light in this city
And make sure they're shining on you

If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home

When life takes it's own course
Sometimes we just don't get to choose
I'd rather be there next to you
Promise you'll wait for me, wait for me
Wait 'til I'm home

All I have is this feeling inside of me
The only thing I've ever known

If only New York wasn't so far away
I promise the city won't get in our way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home

If only New York wasn't so far away
I will be there every step of the way
When you're scared and alone,
Just know that I'm already home
Just know that I'm already home
