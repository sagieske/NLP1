Song:

Your ex is back in town
What you gonna do when she comes around
And she starts to do her act
Will she make you change your act
Will your love for me remain intact
Or will you run to her
Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't change it
You say your love is true
Whatcha gonna say when she looks at you
Will the seconds in your head
Make you take back the thing you said
Will you give me real despair
Or will you stay with me
Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind

Don't change it, don't change it
I will exit and take a bow
But I don't want to do it now
So I'm thinking someway somehow
Baby you'll stay with me
Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't change it
You know she's not the staying kind
Baby don't ya change your mind
Don't change it
You know my love is genuine
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Baby my love is on the line
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't change it
