Song:

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by
20 years in debt
20 years in the government
20 years can never get me by

Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you, ooh

[Chorus:]
Rise to the top of the world
America, America don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in he fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise

1 7 7 6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in you in your mind
And your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you, ooh

[Chorus 2x]
