Song:

Lying in the womb of my lonely room
Thinking of how to reach you
Dreaming of having you

I believe in dreams
I believe in miracles
I believe that toy balloons
Can reach and touch the moon

I don't have the courage and the will
To say the words but I can feel
That what's inside me is for real
Oh and I know someday
I'll have the chance to prove and say
The simple words would come your way
I know I'll have the chance someday

'Coz
I believe in dreams
I believe in miracles
I believe that toy balloons
Can reach and touch the moon

I don't have the courage and the will
To say the words but I can feel
That what's inside me is for real
Oh and I know someday
I'll have the chance to prove and say
The simple words would come your way
I know I'll have the chance someday
Chance for me to say
That I love you
Oh, I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, I love you
I believe in dreams
I believe my dreams will come true
