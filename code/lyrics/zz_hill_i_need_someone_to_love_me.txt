Song:

I need someone
Someone to love me
All the time

I need someone
Someone who'll love
That isn't blind

Someone to share
My warm embrace
Someone to love me
Night and day, yeah

I need someone
Someone to love me
All the time

One more thing I wanna tell you
Right here, little darling

If I met someone
To reach out and hold me
To lend a hand

I need someone
To hold my trembling hand

Someone to hold
My trembling hand
Oh, and be here
At my command

I need someone
Someone to keep on loving me
And keep on loving me
All the time

Whoa, tell you 'bout it, baby, now
(Someone) yeah, someone to hold of me
(Someone to love me)
I need someone to love me

(Someone) yeah, I need my baby loving arms
(To love me) I wonder if you know
What I'm talking about

(Someone) in the midnight hour, baby
(Someone to love me) I need my baby to love me
(Someone) Whoa, I need someone to love me
(Someone to love me)

Just keep on, keep on loving me, baby
(Someone, someone to love me)
Yeah, I wonder do you know what
I'm talking about, darling

(Someone to love me)
If I only had someone to
Keep on loving me all the time
