Song:

If this is what it feels like
Fallin in love
Then I'm fallin for you[x4]

I'm trying to explain it
I don't understand it
All I know
I feel it
Only for you
Think I'm fallin for you[x4]

I got the symptoms
Girl, I get anxious (anxious)
When I think about you
That I don't see you
I see your future
Kids along with cha
Never thought about this
Now I think about it

Every day and every night
I just want you by my side
Feels like I'm on cloud nine
That's how good I feel inside
Everything with you is right
Wanna spend my whole life with you
With you girl

If this is what it feels like
Fallin in love
Then I'm fallin for you[x4]

I'm trying to explain it
I don't understand it
All I know
I feel it
Only for you
Think I'm fallin for you[x4]

Can't seem to focus
You're the reason for this
From that pretty smile, girl
To the way you feel, girl
This gotta be love
Cause I can't get enough
I don't wanna lose you
Girl, I really need you

Every day and every night
I just want you by my side
Feels like I'm on cloud nine
That's how good I feel inside
Everything with you is right
Wanna spend my whole life with you
With you girl

If this is what it feels like
Fallin in love
Then I'm fallin for you[x4]

I'm trying to explain it
I don't understand it
All I know
I feel it
Only for you
Think I'm fallin for you[x4]

I never really felt this way for no girl
Well then, I don't see my life without you (Without you)
In my world (My world)
You're the only one I want (want)
Baby, indeed
From the bottom of my heart
I feel like you're the one for me, girl

If this is what it feels like
Fallin in love
Then I'm fallin for you[x4]

I'm trying to explain it
I don't understand it
All I know
I feel it
Only for you
Think I'm fallin for you[x4]

I'm fallin for you
Oh yeahh
I'm fallin for you[x4]
Fallin for you
