Song:

Tell me doctor, where are we goin this time?
Is this the fifties, or 1999?
All I wanted to do.....
Was play my guitar and sing......
So take me away!
I don't mind!
But you better promise me
I'll be back in time!
Gotta get back in time!
Don't bet your future,
On one roll of the dice,
You better remember,
Lightning never strikes twice!
Please don't drive in it!
Don't wanna be late again,
So take me away,
I don't mind,
But you better promise me,
I'll be back in time!
Gotta get back in time!
Gotta get back in ti-ime!
Get me back in time!
Gotta get back in time!
Gotta get back in ti-ime!
Get back get back!
Gotta get back in time!
Gotta get back in ti-ime!
Get back get back!
