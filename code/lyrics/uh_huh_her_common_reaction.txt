Song:

Hey love, your face is full of lies
Be careful what you ask
Be cautious how you act
You're tired, tired of the dark
Oh you're covered in dust, yeah
You're covered in dust

(You don't believe)
How can you fall from a
Wound like that dear?
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
And you tell me everything is alright,
You don't mind
How can you feel when
You're wounded like that dear?
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
And you tell me everything is alright
And you don't mind
Waste my time

Ooh
Do you realize, you're caught in the middle with your alibi
You've been living in a dream
And you think "will I likely fall?"
Oh still you lie, based on the fact
That you will always hide
Oh you're covered in dust,
You're covered in dust

(You don't feel right)
How can you fall from a would like that dear?
(Don't feel right)
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
(You get higher)
And you tell me everything is alright
(And you don't mind) But you don't mind
(You don't feel right)
How can you feel when
You're wounded like that dear?
(Don't feel right)
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
(You get higher)
And you tell me everything is alright
(And you don't mind) But you don't mind
Waste my time

Oh, I don't like quiet in the rain with you
I don't like quiet, you wait for fire against the wall
I don't like quiet in the rain with you
I don't like quiet, you wait for fire against the wall

(You don't feel right)
How can you feel when
You're wounded like that dear?
(Don't feel right)
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
(You get higher)
And you tell me everything is alright
(And you don't mind) But you don't mind

(You don't feel right)
How can you feel when
You're wounded like that dear?
(Don't feel right)
Don't mind, it's a common reaction
(You get higher)
And you tell me everything is alright
(And you don't mind) But you don't mind
Waste my time
