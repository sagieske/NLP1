Song:

I looked into your eyes
I feel the pain inside
I told you I was gonna stay forever
But things won't work out right
It's time I have to go
Oh babe it's gone but pls you got to let me go

I won't blame you if you turn and walk away
The broken dreams and promises we made
And when I leave you pls don't ever look my way
You see me crying over you

Heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love you so
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
It's hard letting go, you gonna let me go
We gonna leave it all behind

You touched me deep inside
With you I came alive
I never thought I'd live a day without you
And then you came along
I found out that I was wrong
Oh babe it's hard but pls you got to let me go

I won't blame you if you turn and walk away
The broken dreams and promises we made
And when I leave you pls don't ever look my way
'Coz you see me crying over you

Heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love you so
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
It's hard letting go, you gonna let me go
We gonna leave it all behind

Heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love you so.
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love you so.
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love you so.
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
I got to let you know that babe I love y ou so
For heartbreak, you give me a heartbreak
It's hard letting go, you gonna let me go
We gonna leave it all behind
