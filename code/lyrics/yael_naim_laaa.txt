Song:

Here we are now
In this moment together
We live a life so free
You and me... 

I'm so happy
That you're with me
Hold me in your arms
When u smile at me
I feel a need to sing
This melody... 

Laaaa aaah laaa ahhhh
Laaa ahhh laaaa aahhh
Laaaa aaaaah laaaa aaaah
Laaaa aaaaah aaaahhhh.


Joy of sunlight
Glimming raise of light
Shimer in your hair
As the wind touches the sea
We'll together... real free
Oh my dolls like lifting clouds
The salt into ________.
Yes life so beautiful
And I feel a need to sing
This melody... 

Laaaa aaaaaah lllaaaaa aaaaah
Laaaa ahhh laaaa aaaah aaaah... 

Here we are now
In this moment together
We live a life so free
You and me... 
You make me happy
The way u touch me
Hold me in your arms
Life is so beautiful
When u smile at me
I need to sing this melody... 
Laaaa aaaaaah lllaaaaa aaaaah
Laaaa ahhh laaaa aaaah aaaah... 

Laaaa aaaaaah laaaaa aaaaah
Laaaa ahhh laaaa aaaah aaaah... 

Laaaa aaaaaah lllaaaaa aaaaah laaaa ahhh laaaa aaaah aaaah...
