Song:

Casualty is the only question
That should concern our modern time
Not scriptures or stories of majesty
Not interpretive tales of old
Whole lives responsible for nothing
For we haven't been left to be known
The intricacies of the universe
All the reasons to the questions are shown
Only man, and man alone
Can make an excuse
An excuse for warfare
Only man can take themselves to put the words
Into our minds, into our conscience

There's a thousand ends that never came
But the prophecies remain the same
A matter of history convenience
A story that will never change

Found in the maze of reality
A sobering reminder that, 
Our cause needs no instigator
One being a need for a leader
Someone to fill all the needs
Of the many, one or other
A story that will never change
