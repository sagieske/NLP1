Song:

The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't want to leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel of
50 feet of chrome and steel and a load
They need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

Sometimes late at night
I see you picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me
Where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from you hair and your kiss
Girl that's what I miss
Still I drive there horses through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know

And I'll ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
