Song:

When the dream is so far gone how hard will you push?
When there's no one to follow, how long til you fade away?
Will you stay?
Will you stay?
When the dream is so far gone how hard will you push?
When there's no one to follow, how long til you fade away?

I must stand alone, I can, I am dreams of the day to come
It never ends, there's no resignation
Would you sacrifice everything you know?
Just to stand alone, I can, I am

So when there's no one left to follow, how long until you fade, fade away?
I choose to fight back, I choose to rise not fall
I choose to live not die and I know, I know that what's within me is also
Within you

When the dream is so far gone, how hard will you push?
When there's no one to follow, how long til you fade away?
When the dream is so far gone, how hard will you push?
When there's no one to follow, how long til you fade away?

And when it looks like there's no where else to go, there is
When it feels like you're all alone, you're not
If you don't wanna fail, you wont
If you wanna live, you will
This is the moment that separates you from everyone else

To everyone who's believed in us through the highs and so many lows, we did
It and no one can ever take this away
I am supposed to be here
I was born to be here
I can, I am
