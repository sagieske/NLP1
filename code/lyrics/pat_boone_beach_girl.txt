Song:

(Little beach girl, little beach girl
Little beach girl, little beach girl)

Little girl, he's hurt you before
But now he says you won't cry anymore
(Little beach girl) take him back
He'll kiss your tears away

(Here I stand) little girl
He's coming home to stay

(Tell me) and when you're scared now
(I'll be there) he'll be right there now
He'll make you smile when
You feel like crying

(Tell me) and when you're scared now
(I'll be there) he'll be right there now
He'll make you smile when
You feel like crying

(Little beach girl) run to him
It's the only thing to do
(I'll be true)

(Here I stand) don't break his heart
He's so in love with you
(So in love with you)
