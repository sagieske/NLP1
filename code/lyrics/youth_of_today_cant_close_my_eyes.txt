Song:

When I see violence on the street
When I see a friend getting beat
When I see youth so unaware
Can't close my eyes pretend I don't care
Can't close my eyes
When I see an unfair fight
Something tells me it's not right
Can't let these problems go unsolved
Won't close my eyes, I'll get involved
