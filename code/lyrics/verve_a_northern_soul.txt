Song:

This is a tale of a Northern Soul
Looking to find his way back home
He's coming from that same old road
You know the one your folds don't know

I want to see if you know me
I was born in a rented room
My mother didn't get no flowers
Dad didn't approve of me, do you?


I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming back
So come on come in inside of me
Let's spread it all around


Give me your powder and pills
I want to see if they cure my ills
I've no time for love and devotion


No time for old fashioned potion


Take a look into my eyes
I tell you so many lies and then I'll let you go into the night
And I don't think I'm coming down
I'm alive with something inside of me...
And I can't seem to get it out


I'm gonna die alone in bed
This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking for his way back home
And my friend said, "Come in side of me
And your speakers are telling the truth
Comming through and into your room on a river of sound"


This is a tale of a northern soul looking for his way back home


And if he sees it I know I'll know (repeat)


And there's fighting on the street below
I know there's fighting on the street below
But I don't' care coz I'm a Northern Soul
And I'm looking for a way back home


Too busy staying alive (repeat)


Too busy living a lie, too busy living my life
Too busy stayihg alive
