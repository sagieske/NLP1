Song:

I promise you from this moment on I will strive to be the one thing you
Hate But will love unconditionally
I wish you happiness in hell
I wish you happiness in hell

This songs for you
All of you who said they'll fade out then you turn around and say that
You're proud
Run home and tell everyone you know we know you're fake

There are no turning back the hands, your words have been heard by all
You said all you had to say so with that said pick it up, go
You have to run faster than that cause it's kill or be killed and you're
All out of gas

I've said this once and I'll say it again
You go in alive, you come out dead and it's your best friend that does it
Respect is everything if you're willing to lose your life for it
You only get one chance to be someone
With all that I have I'll scream so that you may hear and wake trembling
And you wont know if you are alive but you will wish you're dead

Sacrifice yourself, condemned to waking on a bed of blades
With every drop of blood that falls from you, you'll cry
Condemned to waiting for a better day where every road you take leads you
Further from the sky

Respect is everything
Are you willing to die to get the chance to become the one thing that
Everyone wants to be but very few will get to see
And when it's all said and done and everyone is gone, you'll be left with a
Life that's worthless

This isn't over yet
It's just beginning 
This isn't over yet
It's just beginning
