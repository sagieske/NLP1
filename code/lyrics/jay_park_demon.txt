Song:

I was on my way to heaven,
Then she brought me down with a smile.
The scent of her perfume black leather,
One look I traded God for her eyes.

What do I do? ('cause I love her),
When she's a demon (she's a demon).
I'll trade it all (even my soul),
'Cause she's a demon (she's a demon, a demon, demon).

I said I had to let this go,
No sense in burning for eternity.
That's when she started grabbing me, pulling me,
Telling me she's all mine.

What do I do? ('cause I love her),
When she's a demon (she's a demon).
I'll trade it all (even my soul),
'Cause she's a demon (she's a demon, a demon, demon).

Rap:
I was trying to go and save my soul,
'Cause loving you really takes it's toll.
You're the only single name I know,
We must be glued together 'cause I can't let go,
I tried to leave but I ain't getting away.
No wonder your eyes are red in every picture we take,
'Cause you're a demon why are you so evil to me?
But I love it so damn why didn't I see?
You're a master piece gone wrong, a wreck waiting to happen,
The grim ripper might as well go wait in the casket.
Not a human being but baby you're a spirit.
I'm a super hero but you're just a stronger super villain,
The best team in the league with you, I can't win.
Heartbeat won't die, my love's what we can see.
So let me throw again what I still believe,
Baby you're the finest demon that I've ever seen.

What do I do? ('cause I love her),
When she's a demon (she's a demon).
I'll trade it all (even my soul),
'Cause she's a demon (she's a demon, a demon, demon).

What do I do? ('cause I love her),
When she's a demon (she's a demon).
I'll trade it all (even my soul),
'Cause she's a demon (she's a demon, a demon, demon).
