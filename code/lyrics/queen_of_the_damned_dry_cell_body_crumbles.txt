Song:

Finally recover,
And the mood is right,
Lookin' up into a neon sky,
Child of me takes over,
Guess it's been too long,
Since the last time that,
I tried to fly...

Finally I fly,
When I lose control,
Inside my body crumbles,
It's like therapy,
For my broken soul,
Inside my body crumbles

All I need's a moment,
Chance to get away,
From the stressfulness of every day,
Know if i don't question,
And I never doubt,
Everything is gonna be okay...

Finally I fly,
When I lose control,
Inside my body crumbles,
It's like therapy,
For my broken soul,
Inside my body crumbles...

I don't know if I'll be alright,
I don't know if I'll be alright,
It's okay to be myself..
I don't know if I'll be alright,
I don't know if I'll be alright,
I'll never have to fight,
It's alright

Finally I fly,
When I lose control,
Inside my body crumbles,
It's like therapy,
For my broken soul,
Inside my BODY....

Finally I fly,
When I lose control,
Inside my body crumbles,
It's like therapy,
For my broken soul,
Inside my body crumbles...
