Song:

I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

I like to move it, move it
She like to move it, move it
We like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

Keep on jumpin' off the floor
Dancin' 'til your feet is sore
Party hard just like a smarty girl
'Cause that's what life is for
(Yeah!)

And we don't party hardly
(No!)
We just party hard
(Yeah!)
And not because we bored
(No!)
We party 'cause we born to party

We gonna move our bodies
With our hands in the air
And wave 'em all around
Like we just don't care

(Yeah!)
Moto Moto in the house
(Yeah!)
I'm about to turn it out
(Yeah!)
And you know it's going down
I'm physically, physically, physically round

I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

I like to move it, move it
She like to move it, move it
We like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

Party ain't done, party ain't done
Party this belly got started, Act I
It just begun, big action
Pump up the volume, speaker blastin'

Shake up the ground, shake up the ground
Shake like a earthquake quake up the ground
Play to make a sound, play to make a sound
Play to make a, play to make a, play to make a sound

So I can do my little dance, do my little dance
Do my little, do my little, do my little dance
Ants in my pants, got ants in my pants
Ants in my, ants in my, ants in my pants

That's why I keep on movin'
Yes, that's why I keep on groovin'
Yes, that's why I keep on doin'
Doin' what I'm doin', y'all

First name Moto, last name Moto
Here's how you spell it, M-O-T-O M-O-T-O
When I step in all the girls want a photo
Ya know, hey, yo

Moto Moto in the house
I'm about to turn it out
And you know it's goin' down
I'm physically, physically, physically round

I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

I like to move it, move it
She like to move it, move it
We like to move it, move it
We like to move it!

I like to party, party
He like to party, party
They like to party, party
We like to party!

She like to shake it, shake it
She like to shake it, shake it
He like to shake it? Yo!

Somebody say ho!
(Ho!)
Say ho ho!
(Ho ho!)
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up

Yo! Somebody say yeah!
(Yeah!)
Say yeah yeah!
(Yeah yeah!)
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up

Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up

Back it up, back it up
Back it up, back it up
Gimme room, gimme room
Gimme room 'cuz, huh!

I like to move it, move it
