Qed-Island

(Piano Plays)

(Male)
If I walk away like I don't care
Will you magically appear
Oh to wipe away the tears

Oh the feeling in the darkness
Oh I can swear
You feel so real
Please touch me if you're really there

(Female)
Let me tell you how I feel,
I never felt the love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You appeared to me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
Even love would play some time,
Like two islands in the sea,
Separated endlessly

(Male)
Now say you love me like you do,
And, and all the things I want to hear,
Oh please whisper in my ear,
If all the fates allow me to find you,
Then show me how to understand that you're here, right now,
And I can even touch your hand

(Female)
Let me tell you how I feel
I never felt the love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You appeared to me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
Even love would play some time,
Like two islands in the sea,
Separated endlessly
Is there a chance for love, like I've been dreaming of,
The dream could fade away and you'd be gone,
So I'm holding on...

Let me tell you how I feel
I never felt the love so real,
Like an island from a cloud,
You appeared to me some how,
I was yours and you were mine,
Even love would play some time,
Like two islands in the sea,
Separated endlessly

Separated endlessly
