Song:

You ever meet a girl and think to yourself
She's the one
But as time goes on you realise
She aint nothing but a hoeski

When I met you girl
It was love at first sight
Your hair looked so good
Your dress was so tight
At first I was nervous
So quiet and shy
Wasn't sure if your type was
A bro from li
I thought we'd be soulmates
Like budlight and lime
Thought you'd be my girl til the end of time
You were my girlfriend for a couple of years
But then you left me with nothing but tears
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski

Fool me once, shame on me
Fool me twice, woo woo woo

It didn't take
Long for you to crawl back to me
You wanted another taste of Long Island Iced Z
My bros tried to warn me
But I could resist
Because you were the girl that for so long I had missed
You said all the right things
But they were all lies
All I am is a name
On your long list of guys
Now that you're gone for good
My future is so much brighter
But I still hate you for giving my heart a rough ryder
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski

Like me on facebook, follow me on twitter
You broke my heart twice, okay, I'll admit I'm bitter
Tried to read your mind but the print was too small
Bought you anything you wanted when we went to the mall
You've got multiple personalities but not one soul
Hope the only gift Santa Clause brings you is coal
Even though I think about you every single day
You're not the one who got away, you're the one who walked away
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski
Roses are red
Violets are blue
You may have left me but I'll still
Woo woo woo
You say you've moved on
And found yourself a new broski
But I don't want you back girl
Cos you are a hoeski
You are a hoeski
You are a hoeeeski

So you think you're so cool for breaking my heart, not once but twice
Are you serious bro?
Will I get over you one day?
Woo woo woo you know it
