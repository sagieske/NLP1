Song:

(Verse)
The way I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face
(They don’t know)
The way it’s not even my birthday but I still get my cake
(They don’t know)
My little lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets
(They don’t know)

(Pre-Chorus)
And they never will (Never will)
Never will (Never will)
Never will (Never will)
(Never will)
And I ain’t gotta let it out, let it out, let it out
I keep it all in, all in, all in
‘Cause you’re hold it down, hold it down, 
Hold it down for me eh eh, for me eh eh

(Chorus)
The best part of your love is by me
Only I get to see inside it
You want the shit and I, I got it
Oh oh oh
They don’t know

They don’t know
Oh! Oh! 
Oh! Oh! 
They don’t know
Oh! Oh! 
Oh! Oh! 

(Verse)
The way you still shine even when we turn off the lights
(They don’t know)
And you can tell me that you’re not and we still go all night
(They don’t know)
And I ain’t scared so better fall between in your eyes
(They don’t know)

(Pre-Chorus)
And they never will (Never will)
Never will (Never will)
Never will (Never will)
(Never will)
And I ain’t gotta let it out, let it out, let it out
I keep it all in, all in, all in
‘Cause you’re hold it down, hold it down, 
Hold it down for me eh eh, for me eh eh

(Chorus)
The best part of your love is by me
Only I get to see inside it
You want the shit and I, I got it
Oh oh oh
They don’t know
