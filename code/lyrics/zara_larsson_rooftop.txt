Song:

We could be soulmates
We could be so great
We could be happy
One day
Some day
Or in a whole 'nother lifetime

It was the first time our love died
Sh-t was crazy
And the second time just blew my mind
Sh-t was crazy

Lately I don't know what I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got someone and baby so do you

It was the third of September
We were hanging up on the roof
It was that hot, hot night
We were having a barbecue

And I said hi
You said hi
Baby that's when I knew
Baby I just c-can't take my mind off you

It was a night to remember
We were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out
And in came the boys in blue

And you said bye
I said bye
Some of that made the news
I just c-can't take my mind off you

(It was an emotion. another emotion)

And the rain came
Someone caught the flame
And it was crazy
And there was sirens and firemen
Sh-t was crazy
Baby rushing the stairs I see you go
It was the saddest thing that I will ever know

It was the third of September
We were hanging up on the roof
It was that hot, hot night
We were having a barbecue

And I said hi
You said hi
Baby that's when I knew
Baby I just c-can't take my mind off you

It was a night to remember
We were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out
And in came the boys in blue

And you said bye
I said bye
Some of that made the news
I just, I just can't, can't take my mind off you

(It was an emotion. another emotion. first was an emotion)

We could be soulmates

We could be so great
We could be happy
One day
Some day

It was the third of September
We were hanging up on the roof
It was that hot, hot night
We were having a barbecue

And I said hi
You said hi
Baby that's when I knew
Baby I just c-can't take my mind off you

It was a night to remember
We were hanging up on the roof
Someone got knocked out
And in came the boys in blue

And you said bye
I said bye
Some of that made the news
I just c-can't take my mind off you

(It was an emotion. on the rooftop)
