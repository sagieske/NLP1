Song:

[Verse 1]
What if I told you that it was all in vain?
Would it still hurt you?
Would you still feel the same?
Said it's impossible-possible
So impossible

[Chorus]
But you're still waiting on the moment breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after

[Verse 2]
If will you have me
I'll make you happy
Need someone to whom I can belong
Here's my confession
Saving it special
Hoped it would be you all along
All along
All along
All along

[Chorus]
