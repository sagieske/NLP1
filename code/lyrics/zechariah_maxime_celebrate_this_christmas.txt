Oooh Oooh

I can't wait to celebrate this Christmas
To remember the birth of Jesus
The gifts under the Christmas Tree
The excitement all on Christmas Eve
Come along with me to Celebrate this Christmas

On Christmas day
We meet our friends and family
We have a holiday
To unite, get together
Do lovely things for one another
I can't wait to celebrate this Christmas

The Ham the Sorrel Juice
An extended family coming together to use
The heart that Jesus Gave them
A day to solve all their problems
Come along with me to celebrate this Christmas

On Christmas day
We meet our friends and family
We have a holiday
To unite, get together
Do lovely things for one another
I can't wait to celebrate this Christmas

Away in a manger
Jesus died for all of us together
To share love for each other
So let us sing the carols one after the other

I can't wait to celebrate this Christmas
To remember the birth of Jesus
The gifts under the Christmas Tree
The excitement all on Christmas Eve
Come along with me to Celebrate this Christmas

Celebrate this Christmas
Celebrate this Christmas

The gifts under the Christmas Tree
The excitement all on Christmas Eve
Come along with me to Celebrate this Christmas
Come along with me to Celebrate this Christmas

Celebrate this Christmas
Yeah
