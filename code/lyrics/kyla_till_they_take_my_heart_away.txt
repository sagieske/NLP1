Song:

I look into your eyes, so far away
There's trouble on your mind
You're losing faith
Hey now, let me hold you
It'll be okay
Coz I will love you
Till they take my heart away

Remember when you called
And said goodbye
You thought we'd lost it all
And so did I
Even if I'd lost you
I will be the same
Coz I will love you
Till they take my heart away

Believe
I'm here to stay
I will love you
Till they take my heart away

Ooohhh...

Now we're stronger than before
We've made it through
I never felt more sure
Because of you
Hey now, are you listening?
Can you hear me say
Cozi will love you
Till they take my heart away

Believe
I'm here to stay
Coz I will love you
Till they take my heart away

Believe
I'm here to stay
Coz I will love you
Till they take my heart away, away, away

I will love you
Till they take my heart away...
