Song:

Well, be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

She's the woman
In the red blue jeans
She's the woman
That's the queen of the teens

She's the one woman
That I know
She's the woman
That loves me so

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

She's the woman
That's got that beat
She's the woman
With the flying feet

She's the one woman
That I know
She's the woman
That loves me so

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby
Be bop a-lula
I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-lula
She's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
