Song:

Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance

I want your ugly
I want your disease
I want your everything
As long as it's free
I want your love
(I want your love) love love love
I want your love (I want your love I want your love)

I want your drama
The touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
(I want your love) love love love
I want your love (I want your love I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh--oh-oooh)
I want your love and
All your lovers' revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance

I want your horror
I want your design
'Cause you're a criminal
As long as your mine
I want your love
(I want your love) love love love
I want your love (I want your love I want your love)

I want your psycho
Your vertigo stick
Want you in my rear window
Baby you're sick
I want your love
(I want your love) love love love
I want your love (I want your love I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want your bad, your bad romance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I want your love and
All your love has revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
I want your love
I don't wanna be friends

Je veux ton amour
Et je veux ta revanche
Je veux ton amour
I don't wanna be friends
(I don't wanna be friends)
I don't wanna be friends
(I don't wanna be friends)
No I don't wanna be friends
(I don't wanna be friends)

Want your bad romance
(Want your bad romance)
Want your bad romance

I want your love and
I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh)
I want your love and
All your lovers' revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh!
Caught in a bad romance
Want your bad romance

Want your bad romance
