Song:

On the edge lookin over
All I see is a four leaf clover
Maybe a sign of things to come
Should I jump, or should I run?

After I fall, where do I stand?
After my heart is in your hands
And you've got it all
After I fall, where do I stand?
After I've loved you all I can
Will I still stand tall?
After I fall

It's as clear as the blue sky
I don't fear you tellin me a lie
So I'll become your only dancer
And let the sunrise bring me answer

After I fall, where do I stand?
After my heart is in your hands
And you've got it all
After I fall, where do I stand?
After I've loved you all I can
Will I still stand tall?
After I fall

You're a move I wanna make
You're a chance I'm gonna take
You're every dream oh

After I fall, where do I stand?
After my heart is in your hands
And you've got it all
After I fall, where do I stand?
After I've loved you all I can
Will I still stand tall?
After I fall
