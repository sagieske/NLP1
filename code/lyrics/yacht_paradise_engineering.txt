Song:

Hello my children!
Hello my sons!
Hello my daughters!
Hello my brothers and sisters!

I'm here to tell you that the world's last unpleasant experience
Will be a precisely dateable event!

Yes! It will happen in our lifetimes if we commit all of our energy today
To the task of Paradise Engineering!

Up! Up! Out! Eyes closed! We'll move at the speed of light!
Expanding! Expanding! Faster and faster!

Until we become so large and so blissful that we will no longer actually exist!
Our speed will be so great that everything will come to a stop!

We will gaze upon the entire Universe!
The future exists first in our imagination
Then in our will
Then in reality

If there was a hell
That's where I belong
For breaking all the rules
And singing all these songs

If you want me to be your father I will be your dad
And if you want me to be your mother I will be your mom
If you want me to be your friend I will be your friend
But if you want me to be your God, yeah, I will be your God!

Hey, are you a God?
Or are you a saint?
Tell me, what are you?
I am just awake!
