Song:

It's so rare to find a friend like you
Somehow when you're around the sky is always blue
The way we talk
The things you say
The way you make it all ok
And how you know
All of my jokes
But you laugh anyway...
If I could wish for one thing
I take the smile that you bring
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along
Together we dream the same dream
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me
Oh ooh oh
Two voices, one song
And anywhere you are you know I'll be around
And when you call my name I'll listen for the sound
If I could wish for one thing
I take the smile that you bring
Wherever you go in this world I'll come along
Together we dream the same dream
Forever I'm here for you, you're here for me
Oh ooh oh two voices one song
If I could wish for one thing
I take the smile that you bring
With you by my side I can go on
Now I have all that I need
And the sweetest sound will always be
Oh ooh oh two voices one song
Oh ooh oh two voices one song
Oh ooh oh two voices one song
