Song:

Can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
Yes, it's true
Baby, yes, it's true

Whenever we kiss
I get to feeling like this
I get to wishing there
Were two of you

My heart cries out, more, baby
Feels so nice
Want your arms to
Wrap around me twice

Can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
Right or wrong
Baby, right or wrong

When you had to go
I hated it so
I only wish the night
Was twice as long

My heart cries out, more, baby
I love you so much
Wish that there was
More of you to touch

Can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby

Can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby...
