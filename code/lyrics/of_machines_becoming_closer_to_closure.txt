Song:

Drawn to lines which fill the emptiness
Searching for a place
(The conversations)
(Well,)
(They start to turn...)
To heal the wounds

Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep
We can't afford you to be alone!
Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep

These dreams and the reality never seemed so refined
Until I awoke to find...

(That this house is not a home)
(But something I can not define)

Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep
We can't afford you to be alone!
Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep

How long will it be
Until I turn this key and just walk away
Just walk away
((And this I find so unlike me))
Seeking the parts that are lost
Never have I felt so deceived

Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep
We can't afford you to be alone!
Don't fall asleep,
Don't fall asleep
