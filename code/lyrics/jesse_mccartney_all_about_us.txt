Song:

[Verse:]
I'm on cloud nine
I end your sentences, you start mine
When I'm wrong, you say that I'm right
I never felt the way I do when I'm with you
But it's been part time
And I feel it coming, we're in twilight
Grey area wants me to choose sides
And this line of questioning is new, out of the blue
She says

[Chorus:]
Are you all about us? (uh, all about us)
Tell me you're the that one I can trust (that I can trust)
Tell me that forever's never enough (nah, never enough)
That I'm the only one that's getting your love
Are you all about us?
(Damn)
Am I all about us? (all about us)
I know that she's someone that I can trust (I can trust)
But commitment somehow feels like giving up (gi-giving up)
And I love this girl, but do I love her enough
To be all about us?
Are you all about us?

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm tongue-tied
I kiss her lips trying to kill time
She tells me to say something and don't lie
My indecision is a clue (yeah)
I'm torn in two
If I had it my way (my way)
We'd stay the same, nothing would have to change (have to change)
But I hear those words like they're on replay (replay)
And this line of questioning is new, out of the blue
She says (Hey!)

[Chorus:]
Are you all about us? (uh, all about us)
Tell me you're the that one I can trust (that I can trust)
Tell me that forever's never enough (nah, never enough)
That I'm the only one that's getting your love
Are you all about us? (oooh)
Am I all about us? (all about us)
I know that she's someone that I can trust (I can trust)
But commitment somehow feels like giving up, oh oh oh (gi-giving up)
And I love this girl, but do I love her enough (hey hey hey)
To be all about us?
Are you all about us?

[Bridge:]
Can't nobody love you, baby, like I do (li-like I do)
And you better believe it (better believe it)
But I just need a little more time to think this through
(It's true, it's true, it's me, not you)
Are you all about us? (ah ah ah ah) oh oh oh
Are you all about us? (ah ah ah ah) oh oh oh
Are you all about us, ‘bout us, ‘bout us?
(Damn)
Are you all about us, (hey, hey, hey) ‘bout us?
Are you all about us?

[Chorus:]
Are you all about us? (uh, all about us)
Tell me you're the that one I can trust (that I can trust)
Tell me that forever's never enough (nah, never enough)
That I'm the only one that's getting your love (hey, hey, hey)
Are you all about us? (Damn) Am I all about us? (all about us)
I know that she's someone that I can trust (I can trust)
But commitment somehow feels like giving up (I'm giving up, oh)
And I love this girl, but do I love her enough (oh oh oh)
To be all about us? (hey, hey, hey)
Are you all about us?
