Song:

One night you held me tight
And whispered in my ear all night
Sweet words, I never heard
And I believed every word

Next day you came my way
Without a word to say you passed me by
Didn't bat an eye
My darling, won't you tell me why
You're acting strange toward me
Why have you changed toward me

Are you just a breath taking
First sight, soul shaking
One night, love making
Next day heartbreaking guy

That night your love was true
The next day we were through
Your love was gone and you were moving on
And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you, was it just fun to you

Are you just a breath taking
First sight, soul shaking
One night, love making
Next day heartbreaking guy

Breath taking, soul shaking
Love making, heartbreaking guy
Breath taking, soul shaking
