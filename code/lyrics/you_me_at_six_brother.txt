Song:

Have you ever
Felt like you could do better
You have to use your umbrella inside
You have to keep your eyes open at all times
Have you ever
Made mistakes that you regret
Don't say you never
You can't play a player
Oh you all wish you the best

And I'll wait for this to blow over
I'll take some time to recover
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now

You and all your morals
Worry about them tommorow
Double standers through the roof
You're sitting on the top about to fall through
And you always bring me down
Even though I
Carry the flag around
Wanna talk like adults—è now?
And hey there little friend
Here's some things I never said

And I'll wait for this to blow over
I'll take some time to recover
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now

And I'll wait for this to blow over
I'll take some time to recover
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now

And I'll wait for this to blow over
I'll take some time to recover
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now

And I'll wait for this to blow over
I'll take some time to recover
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
I'm okay, you okay, we okay now
