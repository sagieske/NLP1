"Be Kind"
Thanks to Brian Fennell (fenn@wpi. Wpi. Edu)
Be kind to your neighborhood monsters
For they are not as scarry as they seem
If you see one scaddeling
Down the lane or paddeling
Up the stream
Don't screem
For a monster could be somebody's mommy
And their feelings aren't exactly made of wood
So offer one a piece of your salami
Be kind to the monsters in your neighborhood
(hmmmmm hum hmm hmm hum)
Daring and brave
(la la la and something) monsters
Never misbehave
Or hardly
Ever
Loving and loyal
True to the end
Hairy, but Not scarry monsters
Want to be your friend
For a monster could be somebody's mommy
And their feelings aren't exactly made of wood
So offer one a piece of your salami
Be kind to the monsters in you neighborhood
Be kind
To the monsters
In your
Neigh-

Hood
