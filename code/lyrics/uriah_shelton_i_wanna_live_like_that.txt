Song:

I wanna learn from my mistakes, and I wanna give back what I take
I wanna be there for my friends, I wanna always make amends
I wanna live like that

Well, I wanna laugh right out loud, and I wanna make my mama proud
I wanna have the strength to cry
I wanna always wonder why
I wanna live like that

I wanna live that way, I don’t want to be afraid
I wanna love like that, every day
I wanna live like that

Well, I wanna be here when I pray, and I wanna slow dance in the rain
I wanna love and be loved back, lose my way without a
I wanna live like that

Well I wanna go when things go wild, and I wanna see my baby smile
I wanna go gracefully, gather shells by the sea
I wanna live like that

(Repeat x2)
I wanna live that way, I don’t wanna be afraid
I wanna love like that, every day
I wanna live like that
