Chorus: Lil Jon (DJ Paul)
Goose got me loose
Gone off patron
Money in my pocket
And I'm all up in the zone like
(Oooh I'ma act a damn fool!)
(Oooh I'm 'bout to act a fool!)

Verse 1 Lil Jon
Crunk tonight just paid
Pocket full of motherfucking money okay
I'ma ball till I fall
Drank till I can't
Runnin up my black card I got money in da bank
Patron on the table crunk n goose
Drank what u wnat bitch gon' get loose
(Oooh) Act a fool till the cut the lights on
And we still ain't goin' home
Till all the liquor gone
I just don't give a fuck
Standin' on the table with the weed fired up
Drankin out the bottle motherfuck a cup
I'll pour it in your mouth
Lean back and open up
(Oooh) Crunk ain't dead bitch
You see the chain
And I'm the king fool you know my name
Party like a rockstar fuck like a pornstar
I don't give a damn i'll buy the whole bar

Chorus x2

Verse 2 DJ Paul
Yes sir a nigga on tonight
I got my money lookin right
But I ain't tryin' to fight
If a sucka touch me
Best believe it's on
Get cracked crush your dome
With a bottle of patron
Right here right
Real fast in a hurry
I hit a sucka so hard
I'll make his vision get blurry
And I'm too clean for this
I'm too lean for this
Figured I'd have happen
So I brought my team for this

Verse 3 Juicy J
Yes sir I'm the realest playa trapstar
Sellin the biggest brickes
I'm the realest playa rapbar
Smokin' purpleish
Step up in the club
I got some love 'cause a nigga rich
Girl between my legs
Doin' me up like a licourish
25 stacks at the bar
Ice on my wrist
Step up to this pimpin'
Get your braided hair wig split
Back up off in my chevy
Brains blown out peanut butter
Ridin high stay high
I'm talkin like st-st-stutter

Chorus x2

Verse 4 Lil Jon
Get crunk in this motherfucker throw yo hood up
Get crunk in this motherfucker throw yo hood up
Get drunk in this motherfucker hold ya dranks up
Get drunk in this motherfucker hold ya dranks up
Lean back in this motherfucker turn that bottle up
Lean back in this motherfucker turn that bottle up
Throw them stacks up bitch make it rain nigga what
Throw them stacks up bitch make it rain nigga what

Chorus x2
