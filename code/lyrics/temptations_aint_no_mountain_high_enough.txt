Song:

Listen baby ain't no mountain high, ainґt no valley low,
AinВґt no river wide enough baby

If you need me call me
No matter where you are,
No matter how far (don't worry baby)
Just call out my name.
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

Chorus:
'Cause baby there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you could always count on me, darling
From that day on
I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, somehow

Chorus

No wind,
No rain,

Or winter's cold.
Can stop me baby.
Ooooh no
Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me
Oooh baby
Send for me oooh baby

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that;
There ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough,
To keep me from getting to you babe
