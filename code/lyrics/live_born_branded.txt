Song:

Jesus called, he won't be coming for dinner tonight
Democracy cancelled out, some kind of fight
So tell me how am I supposed to eat alone?
When all of my butlers have gone, my nannies have gone

On the morning of my birth
I must have wondered at the earth
I must have seen the trees like adam showed them to eve

But now I am american and white
All I know is anxiety and fright
Now love is something I must search for to find

Jesus called, he won't be coming for dinner love
Democracy cancelled out for the final time
I'm beggin' brothers and sisters cut your leashes free now
We were born branded, we were born branded, we were born branded
We were born second-handed down

The shephard is in a field of reality
Blames the sheep for lost possibilities
The sheep may be lost but the shephard is just as lost

A shephard is a man afraid of
Losing all the things he made up to
Keep his feet planted high above the field

And I'm talkin' about mother, father, sister, brother
Teacher, preacher, anyone who dares to tell you where to stand
I say the love is in your hands
Just look at the world, don't try to understand

We were born branded, second-handed down
We were born branded, second-handed down
