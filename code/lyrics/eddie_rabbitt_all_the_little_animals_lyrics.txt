Song:

Doo doo doo doo doo

Little baby ducks rub lotion on their elbows
A little on their knee caps and some on their big toes
Then they fluff up their feathers and they fly away

Little baby pigs eat ice cream with their poonies
They fill up their face 'til they look like balloonies
They eat and they eat 'til they float away

And all the little animals are just like children too
'Cause they wash their face and they wash their hands
And they brush their teeth and then they go off to bed
Sleepy head
Good night

Little baby cows learn to moo from their mamas
They go to bed wearing black and white pajamas
They drink their milk, they grow big and strong

And real baby kids love to watch windshield wipers
They don't like to wear dirty, dirty diapers
They laugh sometimes, sometimes they cry

And all the little animals are just like children too
'Cause they wash their face and they wash their hands
And they brush their teeth and then they go off to bed
Sleepy head
Good night
Good night
