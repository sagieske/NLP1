Song:

Any crown, I've ever won I lay it down
Any praise, I'll ever gain, I give it all to you
There is nothing in this world that can't compare

(You alone are worthy 2X)

You are near to those who call, upon your name
You ever giving and never loving, you remain the same
For you open up your hand, and satisfy

(Give you all the glory 2X)

You are worthy oh Lord
Of all honor
You are worthy to receive our praise
In your presence I live
And with all I have to give
I will worship

You are near to those who call, upon your name
You ever giving and never loving, you remain the same
For you open up your hand, and satisfy

(Give you all the glory 2X)

You are worthy oh Lord
Of all honor
You are worthy to receive our praise
In your presence I live
And with I have to give
I will worship you

You are worthy oh Lord (You are)
Of all honor (Your worthy)
You are worthy to receive our praise (It's only in your presence)
In your presence I live (And with all)
And with all I have to give (I will)
I will worship you (Worship you)
All my years (All my years)
Glorify (I'll glorify)
Your holy name (I will)

You are worthy oh Lord (Your worthy)
Of all honor
You are worthy to receive our praise
In your presence I live
And with all I have to give
I will worship you (Worship you)
All my years (All my years)
Glorify (I'll glorify)
Your holy name (Holy name)

(Hey, I'm gonna bless your name
Yes I will
When I don't know which way to turn
I'm gonna bless your name
Tears running down my face
I'll still bless you)

Cause you are worthy oh Lord
Of all honor
You are worthy to receive all my praise
In your presence I live
And it's all I have to give
I will, worship 2X

You are worthy oh Lord
Of all honor
You are worthy to receive our praise
In your presence I live
And with all I have to give
I will worship you
Worship you 7X
