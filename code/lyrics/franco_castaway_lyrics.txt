Song:

Step to the farthest side of my dream
Be careful of what you might see
So careless inside I'm dying
Slowly

Sail into my wildest dream
Wrapped up like a little bum's shoelace
High strung but I am trying
Hopelessly

On my own castaway
Trapped and caught in between
Darkened skies, tidal waves
But I am moving on

See through the hollowed eyes of my dream
Psycho traumatic hypnotic scene
A mountain of dust to ponder over

On my own castaway
Trapped and caught in between
Darkened skies, tidal waves
But I am moving on

Well I'm blind
Reaction too late
I'm behind but catch me I'm moving on
And on... 

On my own castaway
Trapped and caught in between
Darkened skies, tidal waves
But I am moving on

And on...
