Song:

I need an easy friend. I do, with an ear to lend.
I do think you fit this shoe. I do, won't you have a clue.

[Chorus:] I'll take advantage while. You hang me out to dry.
But I can't see you every night, free.

I'm standing in your line. I do hope you have the time.
I do pick a number two. I do keep a date with you.

[Chorus:]...

(Solo)...

I need an easy friend. I do, with an ear to lend.
I do think you fit this shoe. I do, won't you have a clue.

I'll take advantage while. You hang me out to dry.
But I can't see you every night. No I can't see you every night, free. I do. (x4)
