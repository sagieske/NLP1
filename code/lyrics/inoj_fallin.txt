Song:

I got a thing to say
I gotta see ur face
Cause baby, oh, I've change
I gotta break it down to you

Now dunt forget it's me
This aint no, these thangs,
It aint the same, oh no baby
I dunt want you lookin like fool

Baby, I'm fallin out of love with you
I can't go on, pretending that I love you
Baby, I'm fallin out of love with you
I can't go on, pretending that I want you
Dunt want ur love...

I can't pretend no more
I had to let you know
I did nt want to make you wait
To find another love that was nt true

Did nt wanna tell ur friends
I knew that they would tell you then
And thatll break ur heart again
And I want us to continue being friends but...

Baby, I'm fallin out of love with you (fallin out of love)
I can't go on, pretending that I love you (that I love u)
Baby, I'm fallin out of love with you
I can't go on, pretending that I want you
Dunt want ur love no more...

Living on lies
You know I've tried
Living on nite tears and over cryin
No, no, no, no...
Living in pains, jumping on these thangs
You kno what I'm sayin babe
Dunt want ur love no more...

Baby, I'm fallin out of love wit you (I'm fallin out of love)
I can't go on pretending that I love you
(I dunt love you baby, no)
Baby, I'm fallin out of love wit you
I'm fallin out of love wit you
I can't no, thinkin I'm in love no more
Dunt wanna break ur heart, no, no
But you gotta know
That I did nt care
The love that I gave ya
