Song:

We come to You with a heart of thanks, for your love
To be a living sacrifice, brought with love
We come to You with a heart of thanks, for Your love
An offering of all we are, brought with love

All creation, looks to You
All provision, comes from You
In every sunrise, hope shines through
For Your mercy, we thank You

We come to You with a song of praise, for Your love
The music of our soul's delight, brought with love
We come to You with a song of praise, for Your love
Sounds of joy and gratefulness, brought with love

All creation looks to You
All provision comes from You
In every rhythm we thank You
(In every season we thank You)
For Your love
