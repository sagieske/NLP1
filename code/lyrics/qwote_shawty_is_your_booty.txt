Yeaahh... Booty...

No seriouly

[Chorus: x2]
Shawty it's your booty
That's drivin' me crazy
Love the way it giggles
Like it does baby
I just wanna touch it touch it rub it rub it
Like a freakin dance smack it
Girl I'm addicted to it

[Verse 1:]
See it's your booty
That's drivin' me crazy
From the way you make it bounce up and down (baby)
I'm lovin' how it looks and true religion (tight jeans)
That I wanna make love in this club slowly
So keep doin' what chu doin' (doin')
Don't stop shake it shake it
Bounce it (baby)
Drop it for me
Come up slowly
Listen to me
Just wanna take you home with me
And touch all over that booty

[Verse 2:]
Love the way it moves
To the 808 trumps
So I hope that D-J keeps goin all nite long

And watch you all nite shake your booty in this club (club)
