Woah
Let's go
Listen up

Last week me and Satchel were at the San Diego zoo
We were on our cougar hunt and I ended up with you
Dragged you to a dirty cage and threw you to the ground
I felt the sting down on my thing and I heard a hissing sound

A six foot rattlesnake just bit me right below the belt
Get on your knees and help me please 'cause it won't suck itself

Time to use your mouth (Just get that venom out)
You can't spit it out (Right now you'll choke it out)
I need you to be the nurse
I can feel the swelling getting worse
'Cause it won't suck itself

No it won't

We did a show in Panama and blew their f*****g minds
Rocked it out like Aerosmith from back in '85
I took this chick to the dressing room, just got the candles lit
I didn't see it crawl on me and that's when I got bit

A pissed off scorpion just bit me right below the belt
I'm down and out, I need some help 'cause it won't suck itself

Time to use your mouth (Just get that venom out)
You can't spit it out (Right now you'll choke it out)
Holy s**t, it's getting worse
I don't want to wind up in a hearse
But it won't suck itself

Time to use your mouth (Just get that venom out)
You can't spit it out (Right now you'll choke it out)
I need you to be the nurse
I can feel the swelling getting worse
'Cause it won't suck itself
It won't suck itself
It won't suck itself

Alright
Baby I feel so good, ye
