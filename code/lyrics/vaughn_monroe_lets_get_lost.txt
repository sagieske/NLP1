Song:

Let's Get Lost
Kay Kyser

Let's get lost, lost in each others arms
Let's get lost, let them send out alarms
And if they think we're rather rude
We'll tell the world we're in a crazy mood
Let's defrost, in a romantic mist
Let's get crossed, off everybodys list
We'll tell the world that we have found each other
Darling, let's get lost.

Clint Gorman...... From memory!
