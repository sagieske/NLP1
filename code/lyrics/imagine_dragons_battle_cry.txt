Song:

Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know that all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now
No!
Nobody can save me now

Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I!
I can poison the skies
And I!
I feel so alive

Nobody can save you now
The king is down
It's do or die
Nobody can save you now
Nowhere safe
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die...

Nobody can save you now
The king is down
It's do or die
Nobody can save you now
Nowhere safe
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die...

Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know that all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now
No!
Nobody can save me now
