Song:

I know, I know
You're so tired to hear about what I do
About what I smoke
What I drink
What I cook for my husband
All the travels I do
All the s**t I got for free
It's just like it's all about me
Me, me, me all the time
I so understand you
But guess what
Me and my stupid flow
Me and my Myspace
With only three tracks a year
And they still talk about me
Damn
Let me bust this beat
I am the one they call Uff
I am the diamond in the rough
I came to f**k s**t up
You know Paris is on the map
We got the freshest sound
Your kid is digging all our tracks
The verses please your mom
You might have seen me on the tour
With my cowboy boots
Kicking the electronic crowd
With my hip hop roots
I get higher and higher
Each time you're playing my track
This sound is smacking your a**
My voice is touching your heart
So bang your head, you silly b***h
I know you're feeling the heat
The noise is running through your spinal column
Down to your feet
You've got to let yourself go
Uffie is taking you out
A place you've never seen before
And you might never come back
Here is my flight commander suit
Your ears might hurt a bit
But I'll make sure you get a treat
When we fly off this beat
It's time to return your seat to the upright position
You will find me available to answer your questions
That's some damn good crackers you bring here, son
Serious, these are the best crackers I've tasted in along time
Can you put some cheese on it for me?
And throw something at me when it's ready
Yes I can give it to you b***h
But can you handle this s**t
You wanna taste the sweetest lips
And fly with me on the trip
The little Uff is about to make your sleazy dreamscome true
Even the synth get excited
When I'm a put it on you
If you are good enough with me
I will speak French for you
Baby, jevoudrais juste te faire l'amour jusqu'au bout
La vie estbien trop courte: tu devrais en profiter
Je n'ai pastoute la nuit, alors viens m'embrasser
I wanna hear you scream my name
As you feel the pressure
Use the button on your left
If you need a doctor
Uffie's high up in this b***h
And while she gets stronger
All you stupid faking fools
Copying our own sound
