Song:

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was list but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught me heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
