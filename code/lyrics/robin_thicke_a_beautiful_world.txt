Song:

Many a measles and hand grenades
Do Do Do Do Do Do
Everyone skinny and overweight
Do Do Do Do Do Do Yeah
And I don't know
If livin is the worth the fight
So sometimes I just don't

It's such a beautiful world
Time stands still for each one of us
Ooh maybe I'm no hero
But I can't help myself

I need a reason to smile today
Do Do Do Do Do Do
People are pregnant and underpaid
Do Do Do Do Do Do Yeah
I don't know
If livin is worth the time
So sometimes I just don't

It's such a beautiful world
Just stand still for a minute more
Ooh maybe I'm no hero but
I can't help myself

And baby I don't know
If giving is worth the loss
It's such a beautiful world
Time stands still for each one of us
Ooh maybe I'm no hero
But I can't help myself

All the birds, All the babies
All the tress in the spring
All the joy that it brings
All the top 10 centerfolds
All the joy, All the babies
All the leaves in the spring
All the love that it brings
I can't help myself
