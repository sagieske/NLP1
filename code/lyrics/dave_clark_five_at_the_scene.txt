Song:

Everyone who is lonely
I've got a place for you
Where the music plays
Til way past two

Come along now
Let's go down to the scene
(Well, what's it like there)
Meet me down at the scene
(Tell me more, tell me more)
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene

There's no need to be fancy
No one there will stare
Dress in all the
Things you usually do
There's no need to care

Come along now
Let's go down to the scene
(All right, all right)
Meet me down at the scene
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene

Everyone who is lonely
I've got a place for you
Where the music plays
Til way past two

Come along now
Let's go down to the scene
(I'm coming, I'm coming)
Meet me down at the scene
(All right, all right)
You'll live just like a queen
When you're down at the scene

When you're down at the scene
When you're down at the scene
