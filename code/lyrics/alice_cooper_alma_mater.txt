Song:

Rain is falling
Down my cheek
Searching for the sea
Tomorrow, like the rain
I'll be back home again

I watch
The bus
As it pulls out of view
Someday like that bus
I will be leavin too

But you know
It breaks my heart
To leave you
Camelback
My high school

And now
Alone
Cryin in my beer
'Cause old friends said
Goodbye, I guess I'll be leavin too

But you know
It breaks my heart
To leave you
Cortez
I'll miss you

Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will

Yes I will
Yes I will
You know I will

Well so long
Everybody
I hope that I would see you again
Goodbye
Everybody
I finally grew up
They finally let me out of school

Hey, remember the time - 'member the time
We took that snake
And put down little Betsy's dresss?
Now I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed
No I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed
Well I don't think Miss Axelrod
Was much impressed

Oh, goodbye
Everybody
I hope that I would see you again
So long
Everybody
How do you like that
They finally let me out of school
Goodbye
Ah, I wanna get out of here
They let me out of school
How 'bout that, uh?
Goodbye
Hey, goodbye, guys
Maybe I'll see -
Maybe I'll see you around some time, uh?
'Ey, don't make a stranger of yourself, uh?
Remember the Coop, uh?
May -
I ho -
I hope - you don't forget me or nothin
Goodbye
