Song:

Lets go
Verse
They call it a scene I call it disaster
Down here the kids grow up faster
Scared they're scared to the bone
Like a pack of wolves they don't run alone
One on one they won't look you in the eye
But when the pack's together there's a battle cry
I saw it fifteen on one
When the crowd dispersed the kid was done

Chorus
No (no more)
No (bad town)
No more bad town

No (no more)
No (bad town)
No more bad town

Verse
Yeah, down there you gotta have a label
Just like a cattle in a stable
Knee jerk reaction I call it violence
Why speak out when you could be silenced
Down there out on the dance floor
Too much violence I don't want more
Down there out on the street
I can see the air I can see the heat
[Chorus:]
