Song:

Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh-oh-oh (x2)

I took a walk for the very first time
On the dark side of the dance floor
Lit a match just to heat things up
But I got more than I bargained for

Mixed drinks
Mixed feelings of elation
I should've known
It was a one night invitaion

Don't sweat it
Forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it
Go then it's
Off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve
Don't sweat it
It's over now
Our time ran out

Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh

I took an oath
But I'm giving it up
You didn't have to see thing my way
Nothing more than a casual f**k
Isn't that just how we operate

Let's drink
To feelings of temptation
You and I
With an over-night sensation

Don't sweat it
Forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it
Go then it's
Off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
I walk around with your heart on my sleeve
Don't sweat it
It's over now
Our time ran out

I saw the breaklights starting to dim
I feel the tention that's been pulling us in
And then we do it again
So we can feel alright
Falling in love for the night

Don't sweat it
Forget it
Everything is a-ok
Just let it
Go then it's
Off to find another face
I make you come just to watch you leave
You walk around with my heart on your sleeve
Don't sweat it
It's over now
Our time ran out

Our time ran out(x4)(Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh-oh-oh(x2))
