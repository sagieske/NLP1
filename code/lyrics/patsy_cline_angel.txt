Song:

I can see an angel walking
Someone else is by his side
I can hear an angel talking
And he looks so satisfied
I can see an angel smiling
By his side I'll never be
In my heart I'll go on crying
Only tears are left for me
Time will change many things
New seasons will come and go
But I will never change
All my life I'll love him so
I can see an angel laughing
He's the one that I adore
I will always keep on hiding
All my love forevermore
All my life I'll love him so
I can see an angel laughing
He's the one that I adore
I will always keep on hiding
All my love forevermore
