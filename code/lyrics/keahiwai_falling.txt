Song:

I wanna tell you baby
You're the one that I'm thinking of
But your heart is still with her
And I think she's the one that you love
I only want you happy
Even if it's not with me
Maybe one day
You'll open up your eyes and you'll see
[Chorus:]
That I think I'm falling
Maybe I'm falling for you
Yeah I think I'm falling
Baby I'm falling for you
[Verse 2:]
From the first time
You laid your lips on mine
It feels like the smile on my face
Will last till the end of time
But I'm not so sure
That you're the one that I should pursue
My mind tells me no
But my heart only says that it's you
[Chorus:]
Bridge:
Only time will tell
The mystery has yet to unfold
Who's gonna feel love's warmth
And the other left in the cold
[Chorus:]
Yet still I'm falling
Maybe I'm falling for you
Yeah I think I'm falling
Baby I'm falling for you
That I think I'm falling
Maybe I'm falling for you
Yeah I think I'm falling
Baby I'm falling for you
