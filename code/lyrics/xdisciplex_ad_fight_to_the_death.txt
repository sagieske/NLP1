Song:

The battle rages on at war with myself and with humanity how can you call yourselves humane respect is dead
Don't believe the lies in your head it makes me sick how can you call yoursekves humane it is a fight to the
Death a constant war with the flesh you say I've got to see things your way but what I've seen is countless
Broken lives before me in misery back to back and day to day I just can't stand around and watch the destructive
Games you play I will fight to the dead until my last breath.
