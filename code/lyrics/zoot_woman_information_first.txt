Song:

World games
On the screen
All eyes on line
Preset fantasy
No more romance

Talking
Watching
Modern expression
Closer weґll find

Only know you could be beautiful
Weґre so near apart
Touch your tv feeling just the same
Youґre my information first

K. C. Ask me why
Pass me by
No emotion calls
Anonymous love

Talking
Watching
Modern expression
Closer weґll find

Only know you could be beautiful
Weґre so near apart

Touch your tv feeling just the same
Youґre my information first

Only know you could be beautiful
Weґre so near apart
Touch your tv feeling just the same
Youґre my information first

Talking
Watching
Modern expression
Closer weґll find

Only know you could be beautiful
Weґre so near apart
Touch your tv feeling just the same
Youґre my information first

Only know you could be beautiful
Only know you could be beautiful
