Song:

She's got this picture in her head of leaving
Feels like there's nothing left, for no good reason
How could he hit her, she's wasn't born a quitter
And she never deserved to be treated like that

She leaves a letter as she leaves his place
Still feeling all the bruises on her face
She only wanted to feel like she was wanted
And that all changed when he broke that bottle

[Pre-Chorus:]
And she said, you might have got the best of me
But you'll never get the rest of me

[Chorus:]
I'm not afraid to be who I am
'Cause nobody told me that I couldn't be that
I wanna scream like it's never been said
But I mean it like a black tattoo
I wanna care about what everyone says
I don't wanna live inside a past that's dead
I wanna touch down where miracles live
And show it like a black tattoo

She grabs her keys and she drives on down the road
Her thoughts are flashing through her mind like vertigo
But she knows if she stops that she'll just go back
Her mother told her she was smarter than that

What ever happened to the world, when did she stop dreaming
No matter what she never stopped believing
She said I want a life that's filled with meaning
I don't want anything else and she said

[Pre-Chorus:]
And she said, you might have got the best of me
But you'll never get the rest of me

[Chorus:]
I'm not afraid to be who I am
'Cause nobody told me that I couldn't be that
I wanna scream like it's never been said(?)
But I mean it like a black tattoo
And I wanna care about what everyone says
I don't wanna live inside a past that's dead
I wanna touch down where miracles live(?)
And show it like a black tattoo
(Repeat 2x)

Tattoo, Tattoo, show it like a black tattoo
(Repeat 3x)

Show it like a black tattoo
