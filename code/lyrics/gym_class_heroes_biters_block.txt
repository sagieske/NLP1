Song:

This Is Not Novelty

This Is Nothing Delicate

This Is The Result Of Some Peoples Search For Something Relevant

Stake Claim Immediately

Cause Hot Products Cool Down

At Which Point Will Flock The New Sounds

Take Fame Intravenously

But When Nature Turns To Habit

Ill Be Sure To Leave The Scene And Start Stacking It

This Is Nothing Fraudulent

This Is That Sure Shot Itchy Finger Lingering Behind Your Target Audience

You Got Em All Convinced

But We Aint Buying It Buddy

Demand For Lies Is High

And Youre Supplying It

Truth Is Brutal And Consumes You If You Let It

Type That In Your Little Away Message And Set It

[Chorus:]

Keep Singing Songs For Me

That I Can Write In My Sleep Like I'm Counting Sheep

Keep Singing Songs For Me

Man You Warning Me What You Ought To Be

Keep Singing Songs For Me

Just Following The Leader With Your Blah Blah Blah

Keep Singing Songs For Me

That I Can Write In My Sleep Like I'm Counting Sheep

And This Is Not A Fashion Statement

Its Elegant Intuition

Far Beyond Your Bed Wetter Kindergarten Compositions

This Is A Part Of Me

How Can You Sleep At Night

When What You don't Bite You Write Half-heartedly

Go Join The Army

And Be The Best You Can Be

Give New Meaning To Blowing Up Overseas

Please

We Kick Them Doors Down When Nobody Would Let Us In

And Give You That Proverbial Taste Of Your Own Medicine

We Took Your Formula And Relabeled It

And Sat Patiently And Giggled It When You Drank It

Its New Poison Street Cred When Just About The Same Reflesh

Pop Bottles And Dropped Names

And Youll Dismiss It Cause It isn't What Youre Used To

But Who The f**k Died And Made You King Koopa

[Chorus:]

Wow Congratulations On Your New Purchase

I Heard You Bought A Crib On Biters Block Downtown Plagiarisms Paradise

Youre Not A Movement

Youre Purely Amusement

The Poster Boy For Xerox And The Role Model For Parasites

You Serve No Purpose

Youre Purely Decorative

And Bore Use To Death With Your Auditory Sedatives

Oh They don't See

No, We don't Sleep

And Hog Tie Your Runaway Bride With Cold Feet

We Built This City On Lock And Load Logic

And Burned It Down The Same Night

So Go Ahead And Put Your Tears On Ice Baby

I Think We Got A Winner

And Kiss Your Crucifix Your Boys A Certified Sinner

[Chorus:]
