Song:

Say goodbye to the storms in the night
Say goodbye to this beautiful sight
Because we pieced it all together when it just felt right
We pieced it all together when it just felt right

Every turn it took, we followed
Every turn it took, we followed
This compass led us to the land we call home
After years of hope...
I'm writing home to let them know we made it to the coast
Just look at where we are
The skies are clear and blue, I told you (I told you)
And we saw what we wanted and we chased it all, we chased it all
We chased it all

We sailed across the ocean with a boat we built
As we're navigating through the storms we pass along the way
We saw what we wanted and we chased it all, we chased it all

Every turn it took, we followed
We put our lives on the line
After years of hope...
I'm writing home to let them know we made it to the coast
Just look at where we are
The skies are clear and blue, I told you

We sailed across the ocean with a boat we built
As we're navigating through the storms we pass along the way
We saw what we wanted and we chased it all, we chased it all

I'm writing home to let them know
Just look at where we are
The fog has cleared and we can see the shore from miles away (from miles away)
We sailed away

We sailed across the ocean with a boat we built (with a boat we built)
We sailed away with her, away with her

Say goodbye to the storms in the night
Say goodbye to this beautiful sight
Because we pieced it all together when it just felt right
We pieced it all together when it just felt right

Say goodbye to the storms in the night
Say goodbye to this beautiful sight
Because we pieced it all together when it just felt right
We pieced it all together when it just felt right

Part the seas
We've been searching through our sleep
Part the seas
This land will bring us to our knees
