Song:

If the music make you move, cause you can really groove
Then groove on, groove on
If you feel like you wanna make love under the stars above
Love on, love on
If there's something you wanna say, and talkin is the only way
Rap on, oh, rap on
Cause whatever you do, oh, youve got to do your thing

If you feel like you wanna scream cause that's your way of lettin off
Steam Scream on, scream on If you feel like you wanna sing cause singing
Is your thing Sing on, sing on If you wanna make love all night and you
Feel it's right Right on, right on Cause whatever you do, oh, youve got
To do your thing Do your thing...
