Song:

Bright eyes are here again
And I am so low, and so alone
Sweet lady night
Keep me from sunny's light.
Slipping through stone
I'm into being bone.

I was raised on the good books of morning
And I learned how to laugh and get by.
I was gaming and pleasing, 
With never a reason why.

So the promise of heaven was broken
And I held on and I didn't care.
Just a dance for a changer, 
A stranger to brush my hair.

And I know I'm an angel who's fallen from the sky.
And I shine like a star, I burn out, down to die.
Crawling back to my hurt and my heart, hear me cry.
Oh, my heart, I cry, oh, my heart, I cry, my heart, I cry

I must cry for the song of my mama
For the love lying somewhere in me
For the devil in dark night
Who needed the light to see

Touch me once if you like, make me over.
I am lust, I am sleek, and I'm good.
But I'm starting to shiver
Climb up and feel the sun.

And I know I'm an angel who's fallen from the sky.
And I shine like a star, I burn out, down to die.
And I'm tryin' to get back to my hurt or my heart
My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart, my heart I cry
