Song:

Airstreams tethered together like silver sleeping oxen
All the best locations are located on the margins
Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene
It's a mean killer in the daylight, but that's life for you and me
It's a reliable source of information.
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.

Anthrax, ham radio, and liquor.

What if I told you they been lying
About that double wide with water rights?
And now the town cars are back again! 
They sold you some old line
About the greater good and sacrifice
Your friends from Langley are back again! 
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.

Anthrax, ham radio, and liquor.
Coming at you live! 

It's just some people can only see the stars
In the reflection from big black cars.
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.
