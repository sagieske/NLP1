Song:

I needed sunshine in my days
Something to wash away the pain
I saw a very gentle side of him
That took my heart and made it sing
I wish he'd run away and hide with me
Love hurts so much more than it seems
There was one thing I didn't show
I love him and he doesn't know

I wonder if I ever see the day
Will I ever find the nerve to say
I love you
And will he turn around, walk away
Will he leave or will he stay
If I tell him

Could he be the one who was in my dreams
Could he be the one sent down for me
There was one thing I failed to show, babe
I love him and he doesn't know

Have you ever loved somebody
Secretly loved somebody who didn't know
Have you fell in love with somebody
Deeply loved somebody who didn't know

I love him and he doesn't know me
I love him and he doesn't know
There was one thing I didn't show, babe
I love him and he doesn't know
