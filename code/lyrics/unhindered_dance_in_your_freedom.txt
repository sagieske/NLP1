Song:

See the dawn of a new day 
Sweeping across the world 
Hear the sound of a movement 
Every heart be open 
Every heart be open

 He's the father to the orphan 
Healer of the broken 
Desire of the nations 
Rising, rising, rising up

Chorus: Let heaven shout 
The earth resound 
With the songs of your kingdom 
Let love arise 
Your glory shine, as we dance in your freedom

He died for our freedom 
Oh the grave could not hold him
Our sins are forgiven 
Every head be lifted 
He's Jesus the messiah 
Savior the lamb of God 
Rising, rising, rising up

Chorus

He's pouring out his spirit
On his sons and his daughters
He's calling to his children 
Walk in love and power
He's declaring a revival from Oceans to distant shores 
Hear all of creation,  
Rising, rising, rising up

Chorus
