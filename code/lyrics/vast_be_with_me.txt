Song:

You were standing in a dark club
Down in new orleans
You were walking by a cafe
On a paris street

Be with me
Protect me from the darkness of the sun
Be with me
Right now I just need to be with someone

Saw you lying on the soft bed
I had made for you
Words unspoken
Are the only words I know are ture

Be with me
You are the flower in a desert sea
Be with me
Until the time decides that I will leave
It will leave

Be with me

Saw you laughing
Under the heavy london winter sky
Saw you disappear
Into the coldness of the morning light

Be with me
Protect me from the darkness of the sun
Be with me
Right now I just need to be with someone
Oh with someone

Be with me
Be with me
