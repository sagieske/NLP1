Song:

Got me tied down to the way to the beach
Four bad six in the middle of the street
Roll right in and they all hopped in
Now in the sand having lunch on me

Tell the girl don't let your feet get wet
We about to grab some drinks and head to the condo
You can be my weekend guest
I'm in her head so I know we're bout to get started
One thing led to the next, now she got her hands all over my body

I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone cause I drive her body crazy
I don gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
And me and baby girl been chillin all week
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Yes all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
All we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep

Now we on the balcony chillin
She loving the view and we smoke
I'm loving it too while I stroke
Got the stars looking down on us
Do it til the sunrise up

Beat, beat, beat, take a drink, go to sleep
She a freak, she can get it right up, get it right up
Man shorty like to energize up
She just wanna ride, she ain't never tire
She could get naked, accent some bacon
After I eat that I treat that then eat that again, and again, and again

I ain't trying to stop and I know she with it
I can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
And she can't leave me alone cause I drive her body crazy
I don gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
And me and baby girl been chillin all week
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Yes all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
All we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep

Posted up in that 305
Yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Posted up in that 305
Yeah you know it's just me and my freak
All we do is f***, drink, and sleep

Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
Got three bad friends and they all on me
And me and baby girl been chillin all week
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Yes all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
All we do is f***, drink, and sleep
Chilling in Miami and I met a little freak
And all we do is f***, drink, and sleep
