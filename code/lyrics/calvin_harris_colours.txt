Song:

Yeah
Uh, uh, ah

Now I don't care what you dress like
Or what you wear
But please make sure baby
You've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out in black and white
But you're no girlfriend of mine
If you're doing that right
(repeat)

Get some colours on, get some colours on

Now I don't care what you dress like
Or what you wear
But please make sure baby
You've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out in black and white
But you're no girlfriend of mine
If you're doing that right

Get some colours on, get some colours on
Get some colours on, get some colours on

Yeah
Uh, uh, ah
