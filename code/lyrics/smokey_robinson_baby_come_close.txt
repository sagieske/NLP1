Song:

Turn the lights down low, baby come close
Put your hand in mine, oh please be kind
Let me touch your heart, let the fire start
Oooo so warm, so warm

Soft music plays, please sit down & stay
Put your trust in me, let this love be
This is for real, let time stand still
Oooo so warm, so warm
Turn the lights down low, baby come close
Oooo so warm, so warm
(Low speaking voice): So warm, so warm

Oooo turn the lights down low, baby come close
Let dreams come true for me & you
We won't regret, we won't forget
Oooo so warm, so warm, yeah yeah
So warm, so warm
(Low speaking voice): so warm

Turn the lights down low, baby come close
...& fade
