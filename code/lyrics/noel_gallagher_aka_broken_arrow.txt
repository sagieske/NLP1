Song:

A fallen angel with a broken arrow
She come for me and eased my troubled mind

Shine a light out
Into the shadows
All the world they made me leave behind

Leave me peace I'm on the side of the angels
And if I die in dream
Let me live my life
But all lies they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
And I'm lost and I'm lonely
And that's not gunna ease my troubled mind

She wrote it over
A misty morning
Set the sail for all ends blown
She's a siren and I'm a warning
Leave me peace I'm on the side of the angels
If I die in a dream then
Let me live my life
But all the lies they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
And I'm lost and I'm lonely
And that's not gunna ease my troubled mind

Leave me peace I'm all alone with my angel
She's dying in a dream
So I could live my life
But all the lies they have told me
They make me wanna shiver
When I'm lost and I'm lonely
And that's not gunna ease my troubled mind
That's not gunna ease my troubled mind

A fallen angel
A broken arrow
She come for me and eased my troubled mind

Shine a light out
Into the shadows
All the world they made me leave behind
