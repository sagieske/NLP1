Song:

Disemboweled on the altar jesus christ
Entrails in the pentagram circle
Spill his blood and reversing catholic hymn
Invocate the onslaught of Satan
Master Lord Lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Drink ourselves as you feed
His offering of purity
Bible bleed, hell on Earth has been achieved
Thou will fail before Lord Satan
Casting sin, pissing on their crucifix
Stepping forth into his creation
Master Lord Lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Walk His Earth, invade in pain
His christians become the enslaved
What was once is never more
Infernal Lord Father restored
Blinding priest in disbelief
Revenge onto god he has sworn
