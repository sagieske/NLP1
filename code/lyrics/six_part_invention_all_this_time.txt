Song:

INTRO

I lie awake thinkin' of the days gone by
Wishing that you're still here with me, baby
I was wrong and now you're gone
Please hear this heart of mine
Hear me calling

CHORUS
Whenever you're around me
I feel diff'rent in your arms
With the way you touch me
I feel the love that last a lifetime
Your love so true
And I never knew
That it's you I need all this time

See these tears that keep fallin' from my eyes
Wishing that I never let you go, my baby
Take this heart, feel me with your love
Please hear these words of mine
Hear me calling

[Repeat CHORUS]

Yeah yeah

Your love so true
I never knew
That it's you I need all this time
All this time
All this time
