Song:

Nothing like I did before
Will love you more
I need to be with you

Save the rest of all the love I've given you... 
Keep the memories recall them if you want to learn
Take my heart and I'll hide behind to see you close
I'll be watching you

Come into yourself and feel the touch I always do
Look into your mind and see that I'm next to you
Hear the voices that tells you there is someone
Who's over and watching you

But it feels like nothings gonna cross our ways
I'ts alright, I'm never giving up on you again

Don't forget about the things we did and often do
Look into your mind and see that I'm next to you
Hear the voices that tells you there is someone
Who's over and watching you

But it feels like nothings gonna cross our ways
I'ts alright, I'm never giving up on you again

Will you soar and lift up my sorrows
Let me free until tomorrow
Nothing like I did before
Will love you more
I need to be with you

Don't forget about the things we did and often do
Calm and ask yourself if everything is said was true
Hear the voices that tells you there is someone
Who's over and watching you

But it feels like nothings gonna cross our ways
I'ts alright, I'm never giving up on you again

Soar and lift up my sorrows
Let me free until tomorrow
Nothing like I did before
Will love you more
I need to be with you... lift up my sorrows
Let me free until tomorrow
Nothing like I did before will love you more
I need to be with you... ohh... 

I do, I do, I need to be with you
I need to be with you...
