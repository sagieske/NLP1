Song:

Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch, you’re
Waking up my senses
All this time I didn’t know how
Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the fears off
Hiding all my skin
You washed out every scent of me
Earth sick, 
Earth sick, 
Without you

Blow out for me
Empty lungs, 
You can’t sleep
And I drive in too deep
High from hopes and sensibility.

Am I missing out?
Many ways to not give in
My love, in every word
Oh, so weak.

Tight ropes and chains
Held in place, 
No one moves
A soft spot to the touch
Never found the ways to leave go?.

Am I missing out?
Many ways to not give in
My love, in every word
Oh, so weak.

Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch, you’re
Waking up my senses
All this time I didn’t know how
Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the fears off
Hiding all my skin
You washed out every scent of me
Earth sick, 
Earth sick, 
Without you

Tight ropes and chains
Held in place, 
No one moves
A soft spot to the touch
Never found the ways to leave you.

Am I missing out?
Many ways to not give in
My love, in every word
Oh, so weak.

Who do you root for?
Deep in the touch, you’re
Waking up my senses
All this time I didn’t know how
Pulling your hair out
Wipe all the fears off
Hiding all my skin
You washed out every scent of me
Earth sick, 
Earth sick, 
Without you

Earth sick, 
Earth sick, 
Without you
