Song:

[Verse I:]
Show me how to be more like you
Show me how to be stronger in a world so cruel
Show me how to be more faithful in what I don't know
And how to trust and how to lean on you Lord
You said
[B-Setion:]
If I be lifted up from the earth
I will draw all men unto me

[Chorus:]
Can I get closer to You
Can I get closer and personal too
I need to know how to live more in the likeness of You
Can I get closer - Closer to you Lord

[Verse 2:]
Show me how to think more like I should
Show me how to choose between what's bad and good
Show me how to be more prayerful and available
So I can hear you when you talk to me Lord

[Vamp:]
Draw me nearer to you Jesus
You're my sword and shield
Draw me closer than a brother
You are all I need
