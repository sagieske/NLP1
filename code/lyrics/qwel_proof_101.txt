Send* corrections to the typist Man

you can hardly rip that wrapper off my album After
how you ask around you sound exactly like you found 'em astounding Pattern
decisions after this vision Shattering
haveta, listen Rock
habits like the Vatican practicing fact and fiction Impact
collisions, magnifficant, raps, wisdom Assassin
hits passin' battle kids not, laughing with 'em Tattoing
autographs to pass apache missions Bring
your writtens and the kitchen sink Mastered
lyricism Her
it is and, battlin' me's confessing an a whooping** fetish Held
the best efforts from Qwel punkin', pessimists The
funk and festered in a nut shell But
what sucks sells So
best luck with your rep son And
best ups Qwel
