Song:

Since the day I left you
I hear your voice in every sound
Since the day I left you
I see your face in every crowd
It won't go away!
But every time I feel you near
I close my eyes and turn to stone
Cause now the only thing I fear
Is seeing you better off alone

Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind
Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind

With the weight of the world upon me
I can't hold my head up high
So if you see me on the streets
Turn away and walk on by
Cause after the beauty we've destroyed
I'm cascading through the void
I know in time my heart will mend
I don't care if I never see you again

Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind
Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind

Girl, I told you
After all we've been through
I don't wanna be by myself!
Girl, I told you
That it would tear me in two
If I see you with someone else

Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind
Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind

Cut out my eyes
And leave me blind
