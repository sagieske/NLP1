Song:

It's never been easy for me
To find words to go along, with a melody
But this time there's actually something, on my mind
So please forgive these few brief awkward lines

Since I've met you, my whole life has changed
It's not just my furniture, you've rearranged
I was living in the past, but somehow you've brought me back
And I haven't felt like this since before Frankie said relax

And while I know, based on my track record
I might not seem like the safest bet
All I'm asking you, is don't write me off, just yet

For years I've been telling myself, the same old story
That I'm happy to live off my so called, former glories
But you've given me a reason, to take another chance
Now I need you, despite the fact, that you've killed all my plants

And though I know, I've already blown more chances
Than anyone should ever get
All I'm asking you, is don't write me off, just yet
Don't write me off just yet
