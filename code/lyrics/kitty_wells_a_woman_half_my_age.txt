Song:

You say I've lost you to a woman half my age
A lovely young acquantance that you've made
You say your love for me you've laid aside
And she's rekindled flames you thought had died.

But if your love affair with her goes wrong
And if you miss the love you left at home
Come back and we'll tear out this tarnished page
And we'll forget that woman half my age.

--- Ibstrumental ---

The lines that time has etched upon my brows
A face grown too familiar to you now
The look that often took the place of words
You're replacing now with looks from her.

But if your love affair with her goes wrong
And if you miss the love you left at home
Come back and we'll tear out this tarnished page
And we'll forget that woman half my age.

Yes, we'll forget that woman half my age...
