Song:

The stars won't come out
If they know that your about
Cuz they couldn't match the glow of your eyes...
And though... Who am I...
Just an ordinary guy... Trying hard to win me first prize

Chorus

Whoa Candida.... We could make it together
The further from here girl the better
Where the air is fresh and clean

Hmmm hmmm Candida.... Just take my hand and I"ll lead ya
I promise life will be sweeter.... And it says so in my dreams

The future is bright... The gypsy told me so last night
Said she saw our children playin... In the sunshine
And then it was you and I.... In a house baby no lie
And alllll these things were your's... And they were mine

Repeat Chorus

And though who am I.... Just an ordinary guy
Ya know I'm tryin hard to win me first prize

Oh my Candida... We could make it together...
The further from here girl the better....
Where the air is fresh and clean

Whoa my Candida... Just take my hand and I"ll lead ya
I promise the life will be sweeter... And it says so in my dreams
