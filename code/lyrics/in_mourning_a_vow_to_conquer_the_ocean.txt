Song:

The screaming winds are begging, no choice, no options left
But to seek aid from the ancient ones, deserters of the coral legion
Memories from a golden age, unveiling knowledge to navigate by the stars
A haunted heart to leave it's home and ride the waves

Stars align to give guidance
Sail away under the darkening sky, as red turns to black
The night illuminates the path
Sail away, mind made up to make a vow to conquer the ocean

The day the sun forgot to shine, the stars carved something out of the sky
A wooden gift to a haunted heart, for a distorted mind the tide will turn
From a windswept shore, left it's home. Years and years entangled in
Affliction
Stared into the eye of the giant, and time stuck it's head in the sand
