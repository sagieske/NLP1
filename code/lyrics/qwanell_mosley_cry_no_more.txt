Aye waddup ma, I see things ain't goin 2 well, but I jus wanna
Let you kno dat you ain't gotta cry no more, listen

[Verse 1:]
I been watchin you from a distance, I kno what yur missing
How can you stay with him girl when he don't give a damn about you,
You jus need to walk away(walk away), no need for you to stay... You don't need to stress it babe
Come try my love today. What are you waitin for? You don't have to cry no more

[Chorus:]
Cry no more
It's not to late why don't you try love(try love)
It'll be alright(it will be alright)
I'm all you need, girl jus believe(girl jus believe)
I'll take away the pain, you'll hurt no more(hmmm)
Girl that's for sure, I'm willing and able(yes I am) to be yur gardian angel (hooooooo)

[Verse 2:]
I kno what you need my baby
For you girl my heart is so heavy, cause
I kno how it feels boo, when the one you give yur love to
Don't give it back to you(cause) I kno it hurts
I would'nt do you like that girl, I would put you first
Cause your my Number 1 girl, so what are you waitin for
You don't have to cry no more, girl

[Chorus:]
Cry no more(no more cryin)
It's not to late why don't you try love(why don't you try love)
It'll be alright(I'll never treat you wrong)
I'm all you need girl jus believe(heres where you belong girl)
I'll take away the pain, you'll hurt no more(more)
Girl that's for sure, I'm willing and able to be your gardian angel(angel, hooooo)

[Break-down:]

And I'm in need of love(I'm in need of love) so what are you waiting for

Untill the end of time, cry no more baby it'll be fine
Leave it up(cry no more baby)
To me I bet I'll change yur mind
Cry no more, I'll whipe the tears fom your face
Make your past love erase, why don't you try love(why don't you try)
It will be alright, I'm all you need

You'll hurt no more, girl that's for sure (my love is forever girl)

Girl that's for sure, I'm willing and able to be yur gardian angel(hoooo)
