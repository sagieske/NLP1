Song:

Spare me the night trampled upon by submission
Amassed within one's own inhibition
Where the only prohibition is love
Spare me the night trampled upon by submission
Amassed within one's own inhibition
Where the only prohibition is love

Love

Children outcry, "grandfather sky"
Rivers surviving through her eyes
We certify, how you falsify
The beauty of a moth turned butterfly, butterfly

Spare me the night trampled upon by submission
Amassed within one's own inhibition
Where the only prohibition is love

We are being sacrificed by our own suspicions
We are being sodomized by repetitions

Oceans calcified, ego's gratified
I won't be crucified nor terrified, I'm not terrified
Before we say goodbye, no need to falsify
The beauty of a moth turned butterfly, butterfly

Spare me the night trampled upon by submission
Amassed within one's own inhibition
Where the only prohibition is love

We are being sacrificed by our own suspicions
We are being sodomized by repetitions
We are being sacrificed by our own suspicion
We are being sodomized by repetition

Dark gray matter of fact sky
Nannies are nights with our half sister moon
Why can't we switch automatically to Eco-centric persuasions?
Why can't we ditch autocracy for Eco-centric persuasions now?

We are being sacrificed by our own suspicions
We are being sodomized by repetition
We are being sacrificed by our own suspicions
We are being sodomized by repetition
