Song:

I know anything about the life
All the wisdom is hidden deep in the heart
I am scared of the upcoming days
I don't know where, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way

My boat is cruising over there, 
I want it and I know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat is cruising over there, 
I want it and know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me

Everyday I meet the ghosts of the past
Darkness is left behind me, but I will be free
Someday in my life the light will shine
I will forget the past before the dusk comes up

My boat is cruising over there, 
I want it and I know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat is cruising over there, 
I want it and know where
I am handling my life to destiny
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
My boat follows in the wake of you
I am handling my life to destiny
I don't know what future will bring to me
