Song:

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking.
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl,
When I saw you and that girl walking.

I would rather,
I would rather go blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away from me, child.
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby.
Most of all I just don't,
I just don't want to be free, no.

I was just, I was just,
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace,
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips,
Baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face.

And
Baby, Baby, I'd rather be blind, boy,
Than to see you walk away from me.
