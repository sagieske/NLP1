Song:

My my my my my my
My my first love... 
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

Do u remember... 
Yr first hello

When both yr faces
Glowed
Both of u would smile
And be too shy

But could'ntwait
To meet again
(Yes I remember)

Yes I remember
The first kiss

Lyin' on my
Bedroom floor
Hopin' no one would
Walk through my door

He said
He'd never let me go
(Yes I remember)

And looking back
I don't regret
It was the best time

Was like my first toy, 
My first doll
Yes I loved that boy... 

My my my my my my
My my first love... 
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

I recalled the nite
Underneath the stars

It was so romantic, 
He would never ever
Break my heart

Nothing could
Tear us apart no! 

That we spent we were, 
To everything

It was so amazing
Baby we were crazy and

We were young and
Wasn't it fun?

I was so in love and
So deep in love

And looking back
I don't regret
It was the best time

Was like my first toy, 
My first doll
Yes I loved that boy... 

My my my my my my
My my first love... 
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

Put yr hands up
If you ever been in love
Put yr hands up
If you love bein' in love

Put yr hands up
If you ever been in love
Put yr hands up
If you love bein' in love

My my my my my my
My my first love
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

My my my my my my
My my first love... 
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

My my my my my my
My my first love... 
My my my my my my
My my first love... 

My first love
My firr ir ir ir ir ir
Irst loveee...
