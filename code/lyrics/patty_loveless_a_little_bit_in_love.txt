Song:

I don't fall in love as a rule
It always made me look like a fool
'Cause it keeps me up late
I can't concentrate
And I pride myself on keeping my cool
But I've got to admit
That I'm a little bit in love with you

Now I don't want you gettin' me wrong
Because I don't sit up at night by the phone
But then you come around
I let my guard down
And I can't seem to leave you alone
But I'll get over it
I'm just a little bit in love with you

Well I tell myself that alittle bit of love
Can't hurt a big girl like me
But I never have heard
Of a little heartache
And baby that's what's scarin' me

So don't you get your hopes up
If I call
Because I always catch myself
When I fall
But I've got to admit
That I'm a little bit in love with you

So don't you get your hopes up
If I call
Because I always catch myself
When I fall
But I've got to admit
That I'm a little bit in love with you

Yes, I've got to admit
That I'm a little bit in love with you
But that's all you get
I'm just a little bit in love with you
