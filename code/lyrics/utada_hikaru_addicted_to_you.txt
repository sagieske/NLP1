Song:

There is no need to meet you everyday
I've got so many things to do
There is no need to talk with you everyday
I am annoyed with so many phone bills

No love lasts forever
Worrying about our relationship deepens my love
I never talk about our love to anyone
Because I am not a child

This road won't last forever
When it ends we should go our own separate ways

It is a funny story
Even though I'm hurt, I'm back for more
I am addicted to you
Just because I can't meet you
Doesn't mean I will die
I understand our circumstances

* Even so, I am still dying to meet you
I want to meet you everyday
I don't know what to do with this feeling
I want to be mature enough to deal with my own feelings
But it takes time for that to happen
Oh baby (Oh baby)
I am addicted to you

There is no reason to restrict each other
We do not need to pretend that we are mature
At night, he doesn't answer his phone,
Instead his answering machine does
I want to call him to hear his message anyway

I'm in love with you
I know you want me too
I don't say "I love you" not because I cannot say it

It's a sad story
Whenever you doubt my love, I love you more
I may be addicted to you
Everyone's excuse for not saying "I love you" is the same
Everyone thinks that they need reasons

Even so, I am still dying to meet you
I want to meet you everyday
Can I tell you this feeling?
Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (Oh baby)
I may be addicted to you

I feel sad when I can't meet you
I feel good when I am with you
These feelings are addictive
Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (oh baby)

Hold me rather than kiss me
Don't stop without telling me
Oh baby (oh baby)
I think I am addicted to you
