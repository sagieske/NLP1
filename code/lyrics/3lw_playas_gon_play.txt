[Intro:]
The hit maker
The playas gon' play
Them haters gonna hate
Them callers gonna call
Them ballers gonna ball
(Let 'em know)

I, I don't mind (ha)
What people say or do (nah, nah)
But I, I do mind
What you believe is true
You are the only one
Getting all my love
'cause what they do (what they do)
Ain't nothin' new

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

So-called friends
Don't wanna see me with you
Behind your back
Callin' my cell and pager too
No matter what they do
I will stay true
Only to you
Only to you

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

I want you to know (I want you to know)
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
We gotta talk about everything you hear
'cause I know that it ain't true
You can trust my love
And I can trust yours too
Our love will be forever, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Little Women
They gon' ball shorty
They gon' play shorty
That's how they do shorty
We comin' through shorty
The hit maker shorty

Playas gon' play

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Playas, they gonna play
And haters, they gonna hate
Ballers, they gonna ball
Shot callers, they gonna call
That ain't got nothin' to do
With me and you
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

Playas gonna play (uh)
Haters gonna hate (right)
That's the way it is (yeah)
That's just how it's been (let 'em know, let 'em know)

And haters

Playas gonna play (oh, oh)
Haters gonna hate (yeah)
Ballers gonna ball (oh, oh)
Callers gonna call
