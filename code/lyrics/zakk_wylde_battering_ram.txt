Song:

Through your fear I am reborn
My hand of grief can't be ignored

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated Turmoil, again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, Battering Ram.

I kill myself to see you die
As you suffer, tears of joy come to my eyes

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated Turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, the Battering Ram.
You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated Turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, Battering Ram.

You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated Turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, a Battering Ram.
You know my name, yeah you know who I am
Frustrated Turmoil again and again
I am the spike which drives through your hand
For I am eternal, Battering Ram.
