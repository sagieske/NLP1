Song:

Didn't it rain, chirrun
Talkin' bout rained
Oh, my Lord
Didn't it
Didn't it
Didn't it oh, oh my Lord
Didn't it rain?
(repeat)

Rained 40 days and 40 nights without stopping
Noah was glad when the rain stopped dropping
Knock at the window, knock at the door
Crying brother Noah can't ya take on more
Noah cried no, you're full of sin
God got the key and you can't get in

Just listen how it's rainin'
All day and all night...
Etc.

God sent a raven to spread the news
Hoist his wings and away he flew
To the north, to the south
To the east, to the west
All day, all night
All night, all day
Water rising... Etc
