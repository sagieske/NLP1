Song:

There's a fire in the sky
Lost in the white of your eyes
But your body's barely conscious
Someone stole the view

Suspended in a vacuum
Dancing like a molecule
Celestial landfill that you won't ever touch
A sadness you can't touch
Ah

[Chorus:]
Don't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
'Cause I'm feelin' lighter than air
Lighter than air

In this sunset eruption
I've got two left feet and no shoes
If our ocean's bleeding water
The only way is straight through
Now there's nothin' left to prove
Ah

Don't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
'Cause I'm feelin' lighter than air
Lighter than air

[Instrumental]

And we might just survive (might survive)
All this paranoia to keep us alive
We might just survive (might survive)
All this paranoia
This paranoia, ho'

You love to touch
Touch

Don't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
I'm already standin'
You won't let me down
I'm feelin' lighter than air
Lighter than air
Lighter than air
Oh' ah'
