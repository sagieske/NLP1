Song:

Cold world, cold blooded
Trapping niggers at my shows and the hoes love it
Back packing niggers with the air froze level
So don't holler at a n****are if you got no budget
Trying to get my bread up, no, not talking... Rolls
Trying to get my grades up, oh, look how my score rows
Playing till she hit she says, good, make more though
Cole god delivery b***h you got the...
Ain't f*****g with me cause I'm realest s**t,
Well if you feel the s**t, here goes some realer s**t
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm on this train with a millie to my name
Ain't s**t changed cause I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim... Built for the game
Something like a pimp cause I'm still in the game
A little drug dealer... What
I can't try, these niggers out here lying
Why can't I?
Flash backs when my teacher told me I can't fly
Dealer... A n****are crazy just cause I say why
Now look no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Cosign on the beamer but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius but man I didn't been a nerd
Just to tutor bad b*****s while... In the...
That might have been a... That might have been a...
But I'm just trying to find what you're hiding in that skirt
And cole got her coming out he might have been her first
So she only f**k with him like a choir in the church, good god
Mama told me get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer if you...
Well n****are I'ma show ya
This that jessie jackson,... Action... I'm taxing up
Don't let the cover fool you b***h I ain't no freshman
In my own class man I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired yeah I see the stones casted
My s**t is already fired, don't gas it
N****are say my album it sound like a classic
N****are say your album might not even see the plastic
B*****d, how you gonna match with a n****are who...
The s**t that you gonna practice, cast this
A... N****are to the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gone away that every god damn night
Know that I pay for this s**t
That you got damn right, n****are
