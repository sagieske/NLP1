Song:

Can you imagine somewhere in time
Chaos and madness and stars that never shine?
Worlds they collide and all that survives
Is the memory and the debris
Of broken hearted lives

There’s nothing in the universe
That hurts like a broken heart
There’s nothing nowhere no worse
Than the hurt of broken heart

Imagine you’re drifting somewhere in space
Strange stars they blind you remind you of a face
You turn and try to run but you fall into a sun
Or a black hole for the lost souls
And the lonely ones

There’s nothing in the universe
That hurts like a broken heart
There’s nothing nowhere no worse
Than the hurt of a broken heart

‘Cos hearts they get shattered smashed into atoms
There’s nothing no worse in the whole universe

Imagine your surprise when a visitor arrives
Drops in from the heavens with the wisdom of time
When you ask him the meaning of life
He just stares at the sky
He’s signing he’s crying
He’s dying to know if this is as bad as it gets

There’s nothing in the universe
That’s hurts like a broken heart
There’s nothing nowhere no worse
Than the hurt … hurt of a broken heart
There’s nothing no worse
In the whole universe
Than the hurt of a broken heart
