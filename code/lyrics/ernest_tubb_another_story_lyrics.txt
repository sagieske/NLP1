Song:

No regrets no heart feeling it's over all the good times together are through
I'll have a lifetime of mem'ries to keep me going
I wouldn't take back one moment spent with you
I can't say that your leaving won't hurt me but it's nothing that time can erase
And someday this hurtin' will be over another story another time another place
And one day I'll be sittin' with another and suddenly a smile will cross my face
If she asks me what's so funny then I'll tell her
Another story another time another place
[ guitar ]
So no regrets no heart feeling it's over yes it hurts me cause I'd lost out in the race
But someday this hurtin's gonna leave me another story another time another place
And one day I'll be sittin'...
