Song:

Your voice is a song
Sweet and long
I sing along
Your eyes are like pools
Bright and cool
They see through fools
I'll never change my point of view
(I wanted you to know the truth)
That everything I'll ever do
I do for you
All for you
Your hands make me feel
Feel for real
Feel so healed
My love is so true
And my love is all for you
Your voice is a song
Sweet and long
I sing along
