Song:

I had 22 dreams last night
And you were in 21
The last one I saved for myself
Just to save my soul

I got this scene by a fireplace
I lose control and I'm in that place
I had 22 dreams last night

I had 45 films to watch
But only one I could take
The mysteries of a secret smile
It was so dull a place

Pull me over with a loving kiss
I remember all the things I missed
You mean so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun
I had 22 dreams last night

You pick me up with a loving kiss
I remembered all the things I missed
You mean so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun

I had 22 dreams last night
And you were in 21
That's enough for a lifetime of dreams
That's enough for anyone

22, 22, 22, 22
22, 22, 22, 22
22, 22, 22, 22

Just to save my soul
Just to save my soul
Just to save my soul
Just to save my soul
