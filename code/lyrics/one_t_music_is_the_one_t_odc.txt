Song:

Hasn't made it yet
No one grooves to his sets
A genius at thirteen
Vynil magic still unseen

Got no joker, got no glory
Free, free your story
Music is the one-t odyssey

I've got asked by around
Rippin' if his magic sound
Naked rocker boy
Of his only boyhood joy

Got no joker, got no glory
Free, free your story
Music is the one-t odyssey

Hasn't made it yet

I've got asked by around

Got no joker, got no glory
Free, free your story
Music is the one-t odyssey
