Song:

Me and my bike go everywhere together
Just the same way evil did
Me and my bike take pink slips
All around the neighborhood
Me and my anti-biker cycle
We're cruisin' around
We're downtown cruisin' greasy haired
And loud me and mine go fast through the traffic
Doesn't take a whole lotta gas
Mine and me take piles to the drive in
When we win always makin' out at the pass
'76ixties, '76ixties, '76ixties, '76ixties
Midnight, we're gonna bet the farm
Ten of us gonna go for broke
We lined 'em up then we took off first again
I got the trophy-chick
