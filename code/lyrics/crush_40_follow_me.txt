Song:

Anywhere you wanna go
Anything you need to know
All the best in life
I want to get it for you
Baby I just feel so fine
I imagine that you're mine
In my world you're gold
I only want to protect you

Whatever I want, I get,
I want shooting star
Whatever I need, I have,
When I'm with you

Follow me inside, outside
Through the stratosphere
The moon is shining for you
It knows that I adore you
Suddenly all the sadness
Will just slip away
And you will see what I mean
If you just follow me in my dreams

I was searching everywhere
Suddenly I saw you there
And my love arrived
Just in the nick of time
Life floats on a movie screen
You're the star of my scene
We live on the edge of a knife
Larger than life

Whatever I want, I get,
No one could take your place
Whatever I need, I have,
When I see your face

Follow me inside, outside
Through the stratosphere
The moon is shining for you
It knows that I adore you
Suddenly all the sadness
Will just slip away
And you will see what I mean
If you follow me in my dreams

-Guitar Solo-

Dada-dada, dadada-da
Dada-dada, dadada-da

Follow me inside, outside
Through the stratosphere
The moon is shining for you
It knows that I adore you
Suddenly all the sadness
Will just slip away
And you will see what I mean
If you follow me in my dreams
