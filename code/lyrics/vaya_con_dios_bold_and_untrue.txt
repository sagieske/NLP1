Song:

He came back at eight
(And what was he saying?)
He said he missed his train
(Who do you tink he's fooling?)
With that look on his face
And those lipstick traces
(Yeah now, yeah now)
You know the other day (uhuh)
I saw him talking with a stranger
He wouldn't tell me her name (Say what?)
But hey got closer than closer
And when we walked away
I felt that it wasn't over
(Yeah now, yeah now, yeah now)
Chorus
Well, if he's bold and untrue
Don't waste your youth and your time
The games he's playing with you
Are gonna mess up your mind
If all he does is take
Tell him you'll find another
He tried to explain
(And what was he saying?)
He said it was a mistake
(Do you really believe him?)
How could we ever be the same
If I no longer trust him?
(Yeah now, yeah now, yeah now)
