Song:

When I heard the knock on the door
I couldn't catch my breath
Is it too late to call this off?

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

I tried my best to hide in the crowded room
It's nearly possible
I wait for you, oh, most patiently

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

So I looked for your eyes and the waves looked like
They'd pour right out of them
I'll try hard, I'll try always
But it's a waste of time
It's a waste of time if I can't smile easily
Like in the beginning
In the beginning

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater

We could slip away
Wouldn't that be better?
Me with nothing to say
And you in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
You in your autumn sweater
