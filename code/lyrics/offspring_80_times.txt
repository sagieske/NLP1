Song:

80 times was all it took for him he has no more tries
No one seems to care too much for him
You can see it in his eyes

Drive down the street that he's on
Don't look his way
You keep going on and on and on
But you can't hear him say

Help Help
Help Me
Help Help

80 times was all it took for him he has no more tries
No one seems to care too much for him
You can see it in his eyes

Drive down the street that he's on
Don't look his way
You keep going on and on and on
But you can't hear him say

Help Help
Help Me
Help Help

Help help
Help me
Help help
