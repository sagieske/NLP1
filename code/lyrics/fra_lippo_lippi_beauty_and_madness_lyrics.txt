Song:

Over there, just beneath the moon
There's a man with a burden to keep
No sleep will fall washouts rags 'n' paperbags
Home and life passing by

Chorus

Who will see the beauty in your life
And who will be there to hear you when you call
Who will see the madness in your life
And who will be there to catch you if you fall

Now dreams run wild, as lovers find their way
Through the night, not a care in the world
And over there, the twinkling of the lights
Harbor lights say goodnight one more time
