Song:

Size is decreasing
Under transparent purple skies;
The life you've chased seen thru my eyes
Was distorted, filled with lies.

Your hopes are bouncing in front of your eyes
As you jump to catch them floating so high,

Bye, bye,

A top comes a-spinning into your life
And you've reached a height

Threatening destruction in a way that we know too well
Sitting on the limb of love with my friends
Sitting here all alone.

Life without malice can you call this bluff
And say without knowing it's hard enough,

Bye, bye,

A top comes a-spinning into your life
And you've reached a height

Life without malice can you call this bluff
And say without knowing it's hard enough,

Bye, bye,

Bye, bye.
