Song:

[Bridge:]
When we arguin', it's just me and me
I was hardly home, workin' 3 to 3, seems like another time
Feels like another time, there will be another time
I'll get to, forget you

[Verse:]
But, you just walked in
Once you get to talkin', how I lost it
Hard to call it all my fault, mama
Tried to keep you out that drama, mama
Was it all bad? (Yeah)
I was laughin' cause you met, ha
Tell me where he at now? (Where he at?)
Somewhere in the trap now
Wonder why he trap now

[Pre-Hook:]
You was a rich b***h, probably need a rich n***a too
And if you think about me, I'm 'bout to think about you
Me and you cheer for my Lamborghini flexin'
Workin' in the East but you know we in the West End
Name another n***a hustle hard like me
With a heart like me
Just a young n***a with the time like me
You should shine like me
Run that n***a, you don't want that n***a
But I need a bad b***h that's hotter than me
You can hardly admit

[Hook:]
I'm still tryna f***, with you
Girl I wanna f*** with you (with you)
Yeah yeah I'm tryna f*** you, girl, I'm tryna f*** with you
Tryna f*** you girl, I'm tryna f*** with you
I wanna f*** you girl, you know I f*** with you
I wanna f*** you girl, let me roll with you
Girl I wanna f*** with you

[Bridge:]

[Verse 2:]
Go ahead, go ahead, go and ask Billie Jean who's the one?
Let the truth be told, I don't believe you know what I want
Girl if it's a plan you like, I know the bands you like
Know the strands you like, know the brands you like
What kind of man you like? Wanna expand your life

[Pre-Hook:] + [Hook:]

[Outro:]
So you f***in' with a real one
Now you f***in' with a real one
Somebody should have told you
I wanna f*** with you
