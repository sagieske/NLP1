Song:

You paint a rainbow of emotion
You are the rhythm... Life is the dance... Yeah
You are the queen of many faces
How you can move me with just one glance
I don't stand a chance

All the things I love about you
Keeps amazing me now
All the things I love about you

You're a garden of many hidden secrets
Leaving clues to the mysteries you will reveal
You are the eyes of intuition
You see through illusion... You know what's real
Just something you feel

All of the things I love about you
Ten thousand dreams you make come true
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...

All the things I love about you
Keeps amazing me now
All the things I love about you

My while world revolves around you
Changing colors with the moon...
Keep amazing me I never get enough

You twist the truth still your're sincere
To get your way you'll she'd a tear
Don't need a reason when you're beautiful...

All of the things I love about you
Then thousand dreams you make come true
Devil and angel, lover melted into one...
My whole world revolves around you
Changing colors with the moon.

All the things I love about you
