Song:

You grabbed me and whipped me and stretched me
Raw lines were crossed on my back
Teasing and taunting me, twisting my words
Eyes turning red fade to black
Earth Mother, help me
Bury me down there
Earth Mother, can't you see
Suck my breath of air
Snake like you kissed me and chained me
Treachery barred my escape
Surrender to destiny, death for all time
Eternal light, losing faith
