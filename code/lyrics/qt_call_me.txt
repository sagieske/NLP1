[Verse: 1]

I see you in the Classroom with your Head low
Look like you Guys are arguin again
I never like to see You like that
But you keep goin back to Him over again
So He can keep Breaking your Heart
So He can keep Tearing you Apart
And, if You keep letting Him do it
There won't be nothing left
Do you hear my Heart crying out for You?
I'll treat you like a Woman is supposed to
But now is He treating you Right
And never leaving You by Yourself
In the Middle of the Night
No more Heartaches no more Pain
No more tears Girl I won't do you the same
Oh no Girl I wont do you the same

[Chorus:]

Call Me
And I'll treat you right
Call me
All You do is fuss and fight
Call me
You are the reason why
Call me
Just call Me
You know he don't treat You right
He leaves You in the middle of the Night
Call Me
Just Call Me
Just Call Me
Just Call Me

[Chorus:]

Call Me
And I'll treat you right
Call me
All You do is fuss and fight
Call me
You are the reason why
Call me
Just call Me
You know he don't treat You right
He leaves You in the middle of the Night
Call Me
Just Call Me
Just Call Me
Just Call Me

[Verse: 2]

You know I'm only one call away
If your Man tries to get at You just look away
Don't get Distracted keep comin' my way
Don't look back keep looking straight
Look into My eyes Baby Concentrate
Are you ready for the Good Life?

[Chorus:]

Call Me
And I'll treat you right
Call me
All you do is fuss and fight
Call me
You are the reason why
Call me
Just call me
You know he don't treat you right
He leaves you in the middle of the night
Call me
Just call me
Just call me
Just call me
Just call me
Girl don't Treat you right
Call me
Fuss and fight

[Talking:]

Ahhh, ahhh

I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away

[Chorus:]

Call Me
And I'll treat you right
Call me
All You do is fuss and fight
Call me
You are the reason why
Call me
Just call Me
You know he don't treat You right
He leaves You in the middle of the Night
Call Me
Just Call Me
