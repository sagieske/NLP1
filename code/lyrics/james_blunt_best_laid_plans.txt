Song:

You don't like it in the shadows.
You won't let me shine a light.
I would wash away your troubles,
But it seems - the more that I hold on,
The more that you let go, and I know -
You better let somebody love you,
Or find yourself on your own.

Chorus:
Tell me why all the best laid plans,
Fall apart in your hands,
And my good intentions never end
The way I meant.

If we don't talk about the future,
Then should I just follow you into dark?
Yeah - and does your silence keep you cool,
While the cracks form on my heart?

Tell me why all the best laid plans,
Fall apart in your hands,
And my good intentions never end
The way I meant

It seems to me some fine friends.
Who watched you turn your back
It seemed you only want the things,
That you can't have.

Tell me why all the best laid plans,
Fall apart in your hands,
And my good intentions never end
The way I meant
