Song:

Me and you
Ooh
In the heat of the sun
Our life has begun
Like a flame
Me and you
Ooh
All alone in the sand
I will burn in your hand
And my sould will arise to the sky

Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a fire, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a fire

Me and you
Ooh
In the night we will hide
In the flow of the tide
Oh the shore
Me and you
Ooh
There's a message for me
In the sound fo the sea
I must hold you and never let go

You just gotta go
All you need
You can have
All my, all my, all my love
