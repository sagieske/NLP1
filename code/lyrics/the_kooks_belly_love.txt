Song:

I've got a fire in my belly
I'm gonna take it and get it on telly
And tell the whole world how I feel about you

Cause I've been wrong so many times
This world hurts because I'm not of your kind
And tell me how to live without glee
On my sleeve

But ooh mister, tell me what life's like for you
Ooh sister,how do I live like you?
