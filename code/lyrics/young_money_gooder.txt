Song:

[Jae Millz]
Sittin on the toilet
Smokin on some medicated
Count the loose thousands
I'm livin good they agravated
Two things on my mind
One is to keep stylin
And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm counting
Call me J2O
I flow like a fountain
Then I swear I beat the beat up till that b-tch start ouching
Keep them b-tches' asses bouncin
Then we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
I'm a uptown flamethrower young money firestarter
Had to sign on Wayne
I'm from the same place as "Tha Carter"
Ha-Harlem
And I aint like none of these other n-ggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs.
Y-Young Money cloud gas so I buff you n-ggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's f-ckin with us?
You might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them b-tches
I slut them b-tches, we back to the dome, I f-ck them b-tches

(Chorus)
[Lil Wayne]
Times aint the same
Sh-t been going bad
But n-gga we good
N-n-gga we gooder than the motherf-cka
Th-than the motherf-cka
This for my motherf-ckas
We run this motherf-cka
So f-ck them n-ggas
And f-ck them hoes
Money talks
We say hello
And I'm so
I-im so
I'm so
Young mula baby! 

[Gudda Gudda]
Ok it's too much paper
And not enough hands to count it
P-paper coming in money never going outward
It's young money yeah I hear a lot of n-ggas doubting
This here's God work aint nothing you can do about
So n-gga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin money while you n-ggas makin Petty quotes
You can make it rain we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper
Money control my whereabouts
And bout a year from now I'm tryin to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
B-tch shotgun
Prolly be yo wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that
Rap real estate and work
I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming b-tch
Like pain, wayne, and mack maine
I got money b-tch

(Chorus)

[Mack maine]
Yeah, young money I'm the boss
You don't wanna come across
Money do summersaults
Bentley on young adults
Stuntin on them hoes it aint me
It's the money fault
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bow
What it is though
I know what it aint
Yall go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stub, b-tch it's mack maine
Young money up and runnin
J-join the campaign

[Lil wayne]
Times aint the same
Sh-t been goin bad
Bend a b-tch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, cuz it aint what it was
The chopper's so close, I can get that b-tch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster b-tch
I got that dope d-ck, there ain't a b-tch I can't addict
And I'm lookin at the game, I roll my eyes
I-i looked at the clock and the hands were tied because
(Chorus)
Young mula baby, yeah (x8)
