[VERSE]
There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance.
There's a hole in the wall where you put your cock and balls.
But you never really know who's sucking on the other side.
Is it a boy or a girl, or a lady-man hermaphrodite?

[CHORUS]
Honey I don't wanna know, 
Who's sucking my dick today.
I'm going to the Glory Hole, 
Gonna spend my weekly pay.
Dream about Cheryl Tiegs
While the beast greases up my pole. (?)
Gonna blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.

{VERSE]
I know a place down the street just behind Mickey Dee's, 
Where the thing behind the hole really aims to please.
Where a buck oh five is all they need to get a job well done, 
It doesn't matter if it's Tommy Lee or Attila the Hun. 

[CHORUS]
Baby! I don't wanna know, 
Who's sucking my cock tonight.
I'm going to the Glory Hole, 
Gonna fuck it with all my might.
In my head it's Jessica Biel, 
I don't care if it's a fucking troll.
Gonna blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.

[BRIDGE]
Come give your cock a chance, 
No need for romance.
Come soil your pants, 
At the Glory Hole.
Come get what you need, 
Do the dirty deed.
Deposit your seed, 
At the Glory Hole.

Feel somebody new, 
At the Glory Hole.
Fill someone with goo, 
At the Glory Hole.
No one judges you, 
At the Glory Hole.

[CHORUS]
I don't wanna know, 
Who's sucking my dick today.
I'm going to the Glory Hole, 
Gonna spend my weekly pay.
Dream about virgin tits, (?)
While the beast greases up my pole. (?)
Gonna blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.
Blow my load at the Glory Hole.

Oh baby here I come! 
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh fuck!!
