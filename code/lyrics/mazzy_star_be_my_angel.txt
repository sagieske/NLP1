Song:

They say it's me that makes you do things
You might not have down if I was away
And that's it's me who like to talk to you
And watches you as you walk away
Don't say it's useless, don't say forget it
Don't bring me wishes of silly dreams
Just save us all from too much freedom
Too many fingers and too many seams
They say it's you that washes the wind
And brings the night into the day
If you won't notice how can I show you
All of your worries have all gone away?
Don't leave me lonely, don't leave me unhappy
Just bring me up into your faith
If you don't need me then don't you see me
Letting my freedom turn to stone
Just be my angel if you love me
Be my angel in the night
Be my angel cause you need me
Be my angel and treat me right
Don't say "Love me" if you don't need me
Don't send me roses on your behalf
Just take me down and walk through your river
Down in the middle and make it last
Holdin onto you holdin onto me
Holdin on tight to my lover's cross
Don't say it's useless and don't say forget it
You are my spirit and now you are gone
