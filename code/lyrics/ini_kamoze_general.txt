General, General

When we go fe chant, we drop it crucial
We reggae general, eh, heh
We no victimize, we don't partial, do you love that?

Gather Africans, we reasonin' a thing
Tribal love weh we want it
Since you can't blow breath you shouldn't take life
Do you love that, Lord, Lord?

Look around you and what do y'all see?
Mighty people rockin' graciously
If you hurt one, you hurt yourself too
You must love one 'cause they're just like you

When we go fe chant, we drop it crucial
We reggae general
We no victimize, we don't partial, do you love that?

Gather Africans, mek we reason this ya thing
Right, better than the might
The hypocritical Babylonian thing
Do you love that, Lord, Lord?

Listen keenly and what do y'all hear, yea?
Words, sounds, sets your mind in fear
Ain't this a good reason, removin' prison?
This is Operation Roots and Culture, Lord

When we go fe chant, we drop it crucial
We reggae general, eh, heh
We no victimize, we don't partial, do you love that?

Gather Africans, we reasonin' a thing
Tribal love weh we want it
Since you can't blow breath, you shouldn't take life
Do you love that, Lord, Lord, Lord?

Look around you and what do y'all see, yea?
Mighty people rockin' graciously
If you hurt one, you hurt yourself too, yea
You must love one 'cause they're just like you

When we go fe chant, we drop it crucial
We reggae general, eh heh
We no victimize, we don't partial, do you love that?

Gather Africans, we reasonin' a thing
Right, better than the might
The hypocritical Babylonian thing
Do you love that?

When we go fe chant, we drop it crucial
We reggae general, eh heh
We no victimize, we don't partial, do you love that?
