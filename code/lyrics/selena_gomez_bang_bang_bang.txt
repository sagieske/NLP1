Yeah... Yeah...

Woah... Woah... Oh

My new boy used to be a model
He looks way better than you, he looks way better than you

My new boy gets it how to get me
His love is deeper, you know, he's a real keeper, you know,

Bang, bang bang, I'm breakin' in
Stealin' all my love back, givin' it to him-oh oh
Bang, bang bang, this time I win, thought your love was all that, 'til I let him in

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's mopin'

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
When I'm out havin' fun, your gonna be the one that's broken

My new boy knows the way I want it,
He's got more swagger than you, he's got more swagger than you do
My new boy really likes to flaunt this
He's not hiding me you know, he's showing me off you know, oh

Bang, bang bang, I'm breakin' in
Stealin' all my love back, givin' it to him
Bang, bang bang, this time I win, thought your love was all that,
'Til I let him in

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's hopin'

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
When I'm done having fun, you're gonna be the one that's broken

I hope you slip and fall and trip all over my heart,
And just lay there alone, now you got what you wanted
On your hands and knees, gaspin' for air, grasping for me
Baby don't hold your breath, I've moved on to the next

Oh oh oh
On to the next one, on to the next one

Oh oh oh
On to the next one, on to the next one

Bang, bang bang, I'm breakin' in
Stealin' all my love back, givin' it to him
Bang, bang bang, this time I win, thought your love was all that,
Till I let him in

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one that's mopin'

You're gonna be the one, you're gonna be the one,
When I'm out having fun, you're gonna be the one that's broken

Bang, bang bang, I'm breakin' in
Stealin'all my love back, giving it to him
Bang, bang bang, this time I win, thought your love was all that,
'Till I let him in
