Song:

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

Like the night that we met, all black
Like the color of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red now it's just all black.

As long as I could remember I dreamed in black and white
As I grew up and the sun went down I never felt more alright
My mother she used to tell me: "Son you better get to church
It's a dark, dark world and the people out there, and you know it's
Only getting worse"

Yeah!

Never been much for weddings or anniversaries but
I go to a funeral if I'm invited any day of the week.
Some people say that I sound strange some say that I'm not right
But I find beauty in this world every single night

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

Like the night that we met, all black
Like the color of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red now it's just all black

I sat down at her table at the end of the night
She was having black coffee and a cigarette, she wasn't wearing white
She said, people tell me that I'm strange they say that I'm not right
She said the only time I feel alive is in the dead of night
I think I found the one for me!

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

Like the night that we met, all black
Like the color of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red now it's just all black

I remember feeling so alive
The night I looked into her eyes

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like the Rolling Stones wanna paint it black

Like the night that we met, all black
Like the color of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red
I used to see red!
Take a look at my life, (all black)
Take a look at my life, (all black)
Take a look at my life, (all black)
All black
All black
Take a look at my life, (all black)
Take a look at my life, (all black)
Take a look at my life, (all black)
All black
All black
All black
All black
All black
