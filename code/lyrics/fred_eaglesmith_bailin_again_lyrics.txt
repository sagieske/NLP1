Song:

I'm standing at the corner of a bare country road
I've been carving out my daddy's name on a little stone
Oh, I couldn't always talk to him
If he was here today
I think I'd know exactly what to say
I'd say the weather's been hot
Hay is almost in
And if it holds by next week
We'll be balin' again
The wheat is good, the corn is high
Sure could use your advice
And help to raise a couple of kids
I'm trying to raise them just the way you did
I'd tell him 'bout that hardy frost, early last fall
How, oh for while, it looked like we wouldn't make it at all
I'd tell him how it all worked out, just this spring
If he was here I'd tell him everything
I'd say the weather's been hot
Hay is almost in
And if it holds by next week
We'll be balin' again
The wheat is good, the corn is high
Sure could use your advice
And help to raise a couple of kids
I'm trying to raise them just the way you did
My daddy never said goodbye
One day he just up and died
And left me to go it all alone
But, sometimes I wish I'd hear his voice
Helping me to make the choice
Between giving up and carrying on
I'd say the weather's been hot
Hay is almost in
And if it holds by next week
We'll be balin' again
The wheat is good, the corn is high
Sure could use your advice
And help to raise a couple of kids
I'm trying to raise them just the way you did
I guess I'll raise them just the way you did
