Song:

Jimmy goes through the money like a millionaire
Bills pile up around him but he doesnt't care
He picks up his best friend at the local scene
He wraps it up in the corner of a magazine oh yeah

Prechorus:
(all night) god he hates to be lonely
(daylight) hasn't seen any sun in 3 days
(know why) every time it goes doen you can hear him say

Chorus:
Oh all my bridges are burning
Watch them go down in flames
Oh I can't even remember my name
All my bridges are burning

Jimmy treats every night like a holiday
He makes a friend or two but they never stay
Takin care of number one is his point of view
But if you keep him high he'll be friends with you

Prechorus
(all night) god he hates to be loney
(daylight) hasn't seen any sun in 3 days
(know why) everytime it goes down you can hear him say

Chorus:
Oh all my briges are burning
Watch them go down in flames
Ohh I can't even remember my name
All my bridges are burning

Bridge
Wipe the sweat from your lip
Take a look around you get hip
Looking in from outside
Slowly watching yourself let you (die)

Oh all my bridges are burning
Watch them go down in flames
Oh I can't even remember my own name
All my bridges are burning
(all my bridges are burning)
Yeah watch them go down in flames
Can't even remember my own name
All my bridges are burning oh yeah
