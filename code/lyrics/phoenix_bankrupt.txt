Song:

Justice done

People in fashion
Rattle don't hesitate
A look of my own
Your chances are slim
Victory lap
Formal with feathery eyes
Dating vendetta win small
Spray pesticide

Justice done

Caledonian rich and young
Self-entitled portrait
Court in session, justice done
We'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else
Weâ€™re off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home
Stolen kisses, is anyone near?
