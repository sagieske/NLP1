Song:

Big girls don't cry, big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
My girl said good-bye (my oh my)
My girl didn't cry (I wonder why)
(Silly boy) Told my girl we had to break up
(Silly boy) Thought that she would call my bluff
(Silly boy) But she said to my surprise
Big girls don't cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (who said they don't cry)
Baby I was cruel (I was cruel)
Baby I'm a fool (I'm such a fool)
(Silly girl) Shame on you your Mama said
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you cried in bed
(Silly girl) Shame on you, you told a lie
Big girls do cry
Big girls don't cry (they don't cry)
Big girls don't cry (that's just an alibi)
Repeat to fade Big girls don't cry
