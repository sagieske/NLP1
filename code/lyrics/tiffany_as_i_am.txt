Song:

I'm a little broken
I'm a lot confused
I'm very tired and I've got nothing to lose
All I want to know is
Can you take me as I am
You've been searching
You've tested my love
You've been pushing hard to see what I am made of
And all I want to know is
Can you take me as I am
I can't close my eyes
Without seeing your face
And I know if you left
There'd be an empty space
And my life
I gave to you
My body and my soul
And now you tell me you don't love me anymore
And you don't understand what I'm crying for
Oh but please
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
As I am
And I'm not perfect
I don't know what that means
I've been working hard
On what I thought were our dreams
I guess I gotta know this
Just to where do I stand
I can't close my eyes
Without seeing your face
And I know if you left
There'd be an empty space
And my life
I gave to you
My body and my soul
And now you tell me you don't love me anymore
And you don't understand what I'm crying for
Oh but please
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
As I am
Oh but please
Don't leave me
As I am
I'm a little broken
I'm a lot confused
I'm very tired and I've got nothing to lose
All I want to know is
Can you take me as I am
