Will Young
Anything Is Possible

I never thought I could be feeling this way
Standing here in front of you this perfect day
It's hard to imagine where tomorrow will lead
I'll keep this moment in my mind for eternity

Even through the rain I kept my faith
The will to follow through
And I never lost the strength within
And it's all because of you

I'm flying high like the wind
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt again
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
That anything is possible
Possible 'cause you believe in me

In a world full of strangers, you were my saving grace
You told me I was not alone
Alone in this place, no
I never believed it that a dream can come true but
If anyone has changed my mind then baby it's you

Even through the rain I kept my faith
The will to follow through
And I'll never lose my way again
And it's all because of you

I'm flying high like the wind, reaching the impossible
I'll never doubt again, I'm flying high
'Cause your love's made me see
That anything is possible
Possible 'cause you believe in me

It's possible to spread my wings
And reach into the sky
Believe that I can fly away
When you're by my side

I'm flying high like the wind
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt again
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
That anything is possible
Possible when you believe in it
Anything is possible
Possible when you believe in me
When you believe in me.
