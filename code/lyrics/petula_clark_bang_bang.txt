Song:

(Sonny Bono)

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
And he wore black, and I wore white
And he would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Yeah

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, I called him mine
And he would always laugh and say,
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Yeah

Music played and people sang
Just for me, the church bells rang
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Well, now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
And he didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

(Bang bang)
Bang bang
Bang bang
