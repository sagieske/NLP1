Song:

H my God, I know, I know
I've been here before, before
Succumbed again, I'm jinxed again
But I still
Soldier on, be strong
The simple reason is I'm skin and bone
Best not be scared
Just to be aware that alone

[Chorus]
It ain't such a bad place to be because we're opposites
I know you, so don't come creeping back, I'm on my feet again
I'll show you, put you out like a cigarette
A metaphor not to forget
To forgive, it's positive

Oh come on, come on
Did you think that you could pull the wool over my eyes
Much to your surprise, alone

[Chorus]
It ain't such a bad place to be because we're opposites
I know you, so don't come creeping back, I'm on my feet again
I'll show you, put you out like a cigarette
A metaphor not to forget
To forgive, it's positive

Not negative
Live and let live
I ain't holding onto you

It ain't such a bad place to be
It ain't such a bad place to be

It ain't such a bad place to be because we're opposites
I know you, so don't come creeping back, I'm on my feet again
I'll show you

[Chorus]
It ain't such a bad place to be because we're opposites
I know you, so don't come creeping back, I'm on my feet again
I'll show you, put you out like a cigarette
A metaphor not to forget
To forgive, it's positive
