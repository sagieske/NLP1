Song:

[Verse:]
Another season come and passed,
Yet another role not taken.
Every dream I have and fulfilled,
I wanna scream, but I lost the will.

I take another step somehow
The only things that moves me is you right now.
Give me the strength to get up again.
My story’s not over, this can’t be the end.

[Chorus:]
Then your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

[Verse:]
How soon we all forget, put it on the line
To live your life in debt.
I tell myself is too late to change
This is insane, I can’t stay the same.

You let me out the dark,
You stopped the bleeding in my heart
Like does it make sense, but you’ll understand
When I need you most you lend me your hand.

[Chorus:]
And your love, your love
Makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

[Bridge:]
The weight of the world is lifting
I’m taking a deeper breath,
I’m seeing things a little bit clearer.
I turned in a world when I finally found
The man in the mirror.
How soon we all forget?

[Chorus:]
Then your love, your love
It makes me believe that I can make things right
I’m coming back, coming back, coming back,
Coming back to life.

I believe in your love.
I’m coming back to life
