Song:

Look out brother, she's my sister
Ain't stopped crying, since you kissed her
Turn around (turn around), turn around (turn around)
And you better keep on going
Got you down (got you down), got you down (got you down)
But it's been a real pleasure knowing you

Like a teardrop hitting the ground
I don't wanna see you around
Hit the trail baby, don't make a sound
You're just a teardrop hitting the ground

Slip your jeans on, comb your hair back
Got your ticket, in my hand bag
Turn around (turn around), turn around (turn around)
And you better keep on going
Got you down (got you down), got you down (got you down)
But it's been a real pleasure knowing you

Like a teardrop hitting the ground
I don't wanna see you around
Hit the trail baby, don't make a sound

You're just a teardrop hitting the ground, a teardrop hitting the ground

Pack up your cute face, in a suitcase
Better move faster, than a car chase
Baby

Like a teardrop hitting the ground
I don't wanna see you around
Hit the trail baby, don't make a sound
You're just a teardrop hitting the ground

Like a teardrop hitting the ground
I don't wanna see you around
You can scream, but you won't make a sound
You're just a teardrop hitting the ground

You're just a teardrop hitting the ground
Just a teardrop hitting the ground
Just a teardrop hitting the ground
Just a teardrop hitting the ground
Just a teardrop hitting the ground
