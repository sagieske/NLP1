Send* corrections to the typist [Verse

]:Divided
we stand man decides to unite for bandwagon Antagonistic
fashion statements pants saggin grand dragons Street
tagging advertisers plastic, liars bar, codes Stuff
your wallets fat misspell, your cotton pharm clothes Scared
with shopping carts marks March
with the other army ants Be
aardvarks for forty hours thought hardly, a chance How
long can we dance upon, our hands for these snakes Dreams?
capes and screen savers fate baits police states Increasing
release rates complicating everything But
honestly faking, philosophies talk to me never, think Play
level as treble rings mellow, strings and boom bap Embellishing
fiends with tight lids on feathery sheets like do rags Loop
that the, news cast plastic, laugh factory Tap
the s w***cap masterpiece snatch the latch and key Father
testin me inventing recipes to wreck survival The
truth we speak usually, two deep like, 5-O Curse
the ears to sneer wisdom but embrace intelligence We
count sheep on your beef but sheer skills to chill irrelevance We're
wasting time if, you ain't making rhymes tight Hindsight's
20/20 but he's chasin' lime light Yo
we, define height while blind mice just squeak they climb nice These
cats will kill the lie and hype Tight
despite your prize heisters Blistering
heat and listening honestly skip the bullshit Drop
sloppily from seat bottom brought sodomy to the school kids The
Gets?? hot as ice Despite?? his life to prove it The
mic's the fruit of life But???? likes the music Insight
the use of views produce the news and took a joint pollute it blues Infomercials
tie, your shoes you, probably missed the point Make
the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies Make
the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies Make
the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies Make
the children steal fruit so they can swat the lead flies
