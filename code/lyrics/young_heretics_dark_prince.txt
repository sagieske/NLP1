Song:

Dark prince
Take your lonely hands off me
In the dark I have seen your
Lonely blood filled beating heart
Oh no

And dark prince
Set his handsome eyes on me
And through the crowd could see
Another heart beating

And dark prince
Don't pretend you've learned to breathe
You know they all agree
You have never held a pulse till now

I need more than a body to keep me warm at night
I need more than a vampire with blood and lust in his eyes

With blood and lust in your eyes.
