Song:

Looks like the angel's calling
It's a lonley, lonely day
St. Joe you must be joking
Don't take my life away
Calling now
The Angel's calling now
Calling now
The Angel's calling now

I hear the harps a-crying
From atop the pearly gates
I know that Satan's trying
To rope my soul away
Calling now
The Angel's calling now
Calling now
The Angel's calling now

Aaaah..........
A hard time today
Just making it up the trail
I don't need to worry
Just give me a chance to sail

You won't get me to heaven
You won't take me so far
You won't get me forever
Cause I'm not gonna fall

Commencing after tour
You world is here no more
No!!

You won't get me to heaven
You won't take me so far
You won't get me forever
You won't take me at all

There's no one you can phone
You know you're on your own

Well it's so important to you
You scream louder now
You know that it's up to you
You kick and scream louder now
As darkness comes into view
You gotta scream louder now
There's nothing else left to do

Ooooh it's gonna make you melt
Somebody's gonna pray
We never get to choose if we wanna stay
I think there's gotta be many answers now for you
Somebody's gonna cry when they ask about you
I know there's gonna be many answers now for you

Calling now
The Angel's calling now
Calling now
The Angel's calling now
Calling now
The Angel's calling now lord
Calling me now
Calling me now
Calling me now
You gotta take me up
Calling me now
Calling me now
The Angel's calling now
