Song:

I won't suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted
Surrender to nothing or give up what I
Started and stop this, from end to beginning
A new day is coming, and I am finally free!

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll aa-Whoooaaaaaaaaa!

I would've kept you, forever, but we had to sever
It ended for both of us, faster than a
Kill off this thinking, it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now, but without you I can finally see!

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll aa-Whoooaaaaaaaaa

Your promises, they look like lies
Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife(knife)
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you, promise you)
And I am finally free

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go change yourself
Run away, run away, now I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll attack, I will attack

Run away, (I'll attack,) I will attack
Run away, (I'll attack,) I will attack
Run away, (I'll attack,) I will attack
Run away, (I'll attack,) I'll attack, I'll aa-Whoooaaaaaaaaa

Your promises (promises, promises)
I promise you (promise you)
I promise you (promise you, promise you)
