Song:

In spite of myself,
Can't nobody else,
Move me like you do,
I'm addicted to yo,
I try to let go,
But I can't say no,
It's sad but it's true,
I'm addicted to you,
What am I doin' I wish I knew,
This hold you got on me,
Won't let my heart be free,
From this confusion,
When will it all end,
In spite of myself,
Can't nobody else,
Move me like you do,
I'm addicted to you,
I was detemined,
I made up my mind,
Once I walked out that door,
I couldn't take no more,
Of sad delusions,
Here I go again,
In spite of myself,
Can't nobody else,
Move me like you do,
I'm addicted to you,
I try to let go,
But I can't say no,
It's sad but true,
I'm addicted to you,
I wanna be strong,
I know although it's wrong,
I keep holdin' on,
But my will is gone,
I look in your eyes,
I see past the lies,
There's nobody else,
In spite of myself
