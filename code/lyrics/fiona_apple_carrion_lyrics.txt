Song:

Won't do no good to hold no seance
What's gone is gone, and you can't bring it back around
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down

Oh, honey I've gone away
Honey I've gone away
I've gone away

Won't do no good to sing no love song
No sound could simulate the presence of a man
Won't do no good asking no questions
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan

Oh Honey I've gone away
Honey I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away

My feel for you, boy, is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk away

Won't do no good to go no distance
The space between us is as boundless as the dark
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe
You can't intimidate me back into your arms

Because honey, I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away

I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away

My feel for you, boy, is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk away

My feel for you boy, is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk away

Oh my feel for you boy, is decaying right in front of me
Like the carrion of a, a murdered prey
And all I want is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk away
