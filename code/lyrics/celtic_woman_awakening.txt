Song:

Now when the world is shadowed and dark
Now when the sky is emptied of stars
Now when the world is rapped in sleep, in the quiet and listen deep
In the silence of the night

Far off in the distance a fire comes to life
A flicker of a flame breaks through the dark
Burning soft and bright, dancing with the light
Awakening the heavens and the earth

Far across the ocean a flame is rising high
Breaking through the shadows and the dark
Shining in the night, rising with light
Here to wake the heavens and the earth

Now when the light starts to rise
Now when the day opens wide
Now as your dream slips away, you wake to the day
You wake to the light

Feels as the dream falls, feels as the dark turns to day
Leave the shadows behind, and the dream cold and blind
Turn into the light

Far off in the distance, a fire comes to life
A flicker of a flame breaks through the night
Burning soft and bright, dancing with the light
Awakening the heavens and the earth

Far across the ocean a flame is rising high
Breaking through the shadows and the dark
Shining in the night, rising with the light
Here to wake the heavens and the earth

Far off in the distance, a fire comes to life
A flicker of a flame breaks through the dark
Burning soft and bright, dancing with the light
Awakening the heavens and the earth

Far across the ocean, a flame is rising high
Breaking through the shadows and the dark
Shining in the night, rising with the light
Here to wake the heavens and the earth

Here to wake the heavens and the earth, tonight
