Song:

All the love you promised would be mine forever
I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well, it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone.

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you now you are gone.

It amazes me not knowing any better
Than to think I had a love that could be true
Well, I should be taken out tired and feathered
To let myself be taken in by you.

From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers
I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing in you now you are gone...
