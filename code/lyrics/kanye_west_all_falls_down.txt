(Feat. Syleena Johnson)

[Chorus - with Kanye West ad-libs]

[Kanye West]
Yeah, this the real one baby,
Uh, Chi town stand up,
South side, south side,
We gon' set this party off right,
West side, west side,
We gon' set this party off right.

[Syleena Johnson]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down [2x]

(Oh when it all)

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecure
The concept of school seems so secure
Sophomore three years aint picked a career
She like f**k it, I'll just stay down here and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus (with Kanye ad-libs)]
[Kanye West]
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down

[Syleena Johnson]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down.

(Oh when it all)

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's they done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like n***a you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the American dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a n***a in a coupe

[Chorus (with Kanye ad-libs)]
[Kanye West]
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down

[Syleena Johnson]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down.

(Oh when it all)

[Verse - Kanye West]
I say f**k the police, that's how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes but we don't really need em
The things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorties holler, "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealers buy Jordans, crackheads buy crack
But the white man get paid off of all a dat
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause f**k it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus - to fade (with Kanye ad-libs)]
[Kanye West]
Uh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?
C'mon c'mon, and when it fall's down,
South side, south side,
We gon' set this party off right,
West side, west side,
We gon' set this party off right.
Chi-Town, Chi-Town,
We gon' show em how we get down.
Hustling ain't easy, it's like a safe belt,
Save my life, c'mon.

[Syleena Johnson]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you all when it all falls down.
