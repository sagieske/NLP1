Chorus 1
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

Verse 1
Pardon the way that I stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel.
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

Chorus 2
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights.
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say it's ok.
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you,
Oh baby let me love you, oh babe.

Chorus 1
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

Chorus 3
I need you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights.
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say it's ok.
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you baby, oh baby let me love you

Chorus 4
I need you baby, don't let me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you.
And let me love you, oh babe.
