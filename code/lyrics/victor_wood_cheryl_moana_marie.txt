Song:

Cheryl Moana Marie
Back home she's waiting for me
Cheryl Moana Marie-ie
There on the shore she waits so patiently

In the sleepy little town
Where soft breezes blow
There's a lovely little Maui miss
I used to know-ow-ow
Someday I will find my way
And I'll return from the over the sea-ea
To where my island sweetheart
Waits for me

Cheryl Moana Marie
Back home she's waiting for me
Cheryl Moana Mari-ie
There on the shore she waits so patiently-y

Cheryl Moana Marie
Some day I'll wade in your land
Safe in my arms she will be
My Cheryl Moa-ana Marie

Cheryl Moana Marie
Some day I'll wade in your la-and
Safe in my arms she will be
My Cheryl Moana Marie...
