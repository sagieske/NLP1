Song:

I'll leave you behind
It's not the first time
That we've been through this
It happens every time
You hear the sound of my name
At the top of their lungs
This dumb game you play
Isn't fooling anyone
And now I wanna know,
Are you catching my drift yet?
Oh, are you catching my drift yet?
You seem to be good at taking control
Are you catching my drift yet?

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do
And don't lie 'cause we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that your saying
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends till the very end"

And now I know that I have made big plans
And I've said big things that have blown out of my hands
But these hands have counted a lot and have been counted on
Now a handful is all that's left
Can you just look at how things were
And how they are right now
And please just tell me that I am right
Just tell me why it's so hard
For you to be wrong for once in your life

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do
And don't lie 'cause we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that your saying
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends till the very end"

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do
And don't lie 'cause we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that your saying
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends till the very end"

Now that we have said goodbye
Don't try and fix it up again
It's my fault that you can't stand a thing I do
And don't lie 'cause we know that you want to
Now I can't seem to comprehend
How the things that your saying
Is not what you meant at all
Because the last time I checked
These so called "friends"
Were your "friends till the very end"

Oh, are you catching my drift yet?
