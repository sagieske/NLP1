Song:

Blackbird singin' in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting
For this moment to arrive

Blackbird singin' in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting
For this moment to be free

Blackbird fly
Blackbird fly
Into the dark and lonely night

All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
You and me, we're waiting for this moment to be free
Can't you see we're waiting for this moment to be free
Yes indeed we're waiting for this moment to be free.
