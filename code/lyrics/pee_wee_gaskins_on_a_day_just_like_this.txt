Song:

I remember how the first time I lay my eyes on you
It was on a day that just like this
You were wearing your black dress
Can I call you tonight
Can we talk for a while
I'm sick of living in black and white

I'm getting ready for my sanctuary
I'm feeling unsteady
I'm getting ready for my sanctuary
So hear me say

Something better is coming up
It caught my eyes
Something brighter is coming up
It hurt my eyes

I remember how the first time I lay my eyes on you
It was on a day that just like this
You were wearing your black dress

The moment is golden
The days getting colder
So here me say

I'm getting ready for my sanctuary
I'm feeling unsteady
I'm getting ready for my sanctuary
So hear me say

Something better is coming up
It caught my eyes
Something brighter is coming up
It hurt my eyes

I've been trying a thousand times
To let you know
To let you go
But the phone is dead
I can't reach you
