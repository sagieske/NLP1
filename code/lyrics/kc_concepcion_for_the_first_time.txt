Song:

Are those your eyes, is that your smile
I've been lookin at you forever
But I never saw you before
Are these your hands holdin' mine
Now I wonder how I could've been so blind

Chorus:

For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin back at me
Now I understand why love is...
Love is... For the first time...

Can this be real, can this be true
Am I the person I was this morning
And are you the same you
It's all so strange how can it be
All along this love was right in front of me

For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin back at me
Now I understand why love is...
Love is... For the first time...

Bridge:

Such a long time ago
I had given up on findin' this emotion... Ever again
But you're here with me now
Yes I've found you some how
And I've never been so sure
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein' who you are
Can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin back at me
Now I understand why love is...
Love is... For the first time...
