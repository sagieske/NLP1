Song:

I feel you falling
Like the rain against my skin
I hear you calling
Your voice like thunder in my head

But now I am stalling
Cause I'm afraid to let you in
Come break me down with your mercy
Come break me down again

I'm yours tonight
I'm yours if you can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm yours tonight
Come and break me down
Won't you break me down

I feel it inside me
I feel you underneath my skin
These walls could not hide me
They could not keep you from you coming in

So now here you find me
Right back to where I began
Come break me down with your mercy
Come break me down again

I'm yours tonight
I'm yours if you can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm yours tonight
Come and break me down
Won't you break me down

I need your strength to feel this weak
And I need your touch to feel my need
And I need your strong hands to carry me
Take me break me set me free

I need your strength to feel this weak
And I need your touch to feel my need
And I need your strong hands to carry me
Take me bring me to my knees

I'm yours tonight
I'm yours if you can break me down
Break through these walls I hide behind
I'm yours tonight
Come and break me down
Won't you break me down
