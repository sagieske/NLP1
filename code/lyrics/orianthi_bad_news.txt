Song:

Gimme the bad news
Yea, tell it to me straight
I can take it
I'll start on the countdown
I've got about a minute left for you
Someday, I'm gonna laugh it off until I cry
Someway, I'm going to get on with my life

So gimme the bad news baby
Now don't make me wait
I wanna know that I'm your biggest mistake
Gimme the bad news baby
Now don't turn away
I know the truth no matter what you say
Gimme the bad news, the bad news today

So tell me how it feels when you fake it
You nearly ought to hang around
And even if there's nothing left to do
Yea, go on
Let me see you act like the king of truth
Yea, be strong
I'm gonna leave it up to you

So gimme the bad news baby
Now don't make me wait
I wanna know that I'm your biggest mistake
Gimme the bad news baby
Now don't turn away
I know the truth no matter what you say
Gimme the bad news, the bad news today

Tell it to me loud
That you can't take it
Yea, scream it out loud
We're going down
I wanna stay and shout
Now gimme something to do

So gimme the bad news baby

So gimme the bad news baby
Now don't make me wait
I wanna know that I'm your biggest mistake
Gimme the bad news baby
Now don't turn away
I know the truth no matter what you say
Gimme the bad news, the bad news today
Gimme the bad news today

So gimme the bad news
Yea, tell it to me straight
Gimme the bad news
