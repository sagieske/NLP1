Song:

Come back, my darling one
I'm calling on you
The road ahead is long
And I must warn you

I wonder
Where did she go?
If I failed you
I tell you right now

All I want you to know; I love you
All I need is the time to show you

Come back, my fallen son
Don't let them fool you
Cos when the day is done
They'll never move you

Lay down your senseless pride
(Got more than you)
Put out your mournful tones
I tell you right now

All I want you to know; I love you
All I need is the time to show you how I feel
Feel

(Lay down your senseless pride
You travelled once too often, yeah)

I tell you right now
All I want you to know; I love you
All I need is the time to show you how I feel

All I want you to know I love you
All I need is the time to show you how I feel

(Come back, my analogue
I hardly knew ya
The high end sloping off
A thing of beauty
Take hold, my little ones
My minor key sonatas
Show forth your looping grace
No one here can take your place)
