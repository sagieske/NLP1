Song:

So September follows August
I don't mind so three and four and five come after two
Will anything mean anything?
Do I care what tomorrow brings?

I only wonder what comes after you
After you when someone smiles at me
I'll wonder what's the price after you
I'll be suspicious of anything that's nice

I don't know that I'll get over you but if I ever do
I'll never love this much again, not after you

Loving you it was just too good to last forever
So the world could end tomorrow I won't care
After you when someone tells me
There's no heaven on this earth

I can say that I know better I've been there
After you when someone smiles
I'll wonder what's the price after you
I'll be suspicious of anything that's nice
