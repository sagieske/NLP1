(Feat. Lecrae)

[Chorus:]
I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic
I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God whose extremely great
I'm a Fanatic

[Verse One]
The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin
But only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin
And they fate look grim, If they don't take Him
As the high priest He is to mediate they sin
The world's got too many gods, man we choose the One
From Hebrews, He rules, He bruised His Son
He moves the sun
So if we prayin and our schools call us fools
Cuz our God's too true to shun
Channels two in one
Man it looks insane
Tv make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as one and same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the Name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us
But we gon' follow our God wherever the Bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hate while you at it, take a look at our mathematics

[Chorus:]

[Verse Two]
What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied Himself and let out sin hang Him
You couldn't blame Him for any sin
While they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
We are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on tv who glorifying their bishop
From Edwards to Piper, Macaurther to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, From Cali to Berlin
As Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us as evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing out faith
But that's cool, we can carry the weight of persecution
Cuz earth is losing
And if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
So keep it moving
Cuz if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three]
They thought Jesus was out of His mind
They laughed and mocked Him
Called Him a cult leader and they tried to stop Him
Pharisees said Christ got His power from Satan
Hatin', on the very One that came to save 'em
Even after He rose, man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the Name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
And, "it don't take all that to be a Christian man"
And it's hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff
They say "man, you too spiritual, you doing too much"
So we show them the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win if we're rejected because of His Name
We win if seeds get planted and watered and grow
But even if we lost, we still be Fanatical though

[Chorus:]
