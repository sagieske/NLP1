Song:

After a year like this one
I'm surprised I do not hate your guts and
After a year like this one
I'm surprised I still love music just as much

After a year like this one
I'm surprised I do not "eat my eye"?
After a year like this one
I'm sorry if I'm not cordial to every one

CHORUS:
La La La La La La La La De Di De Di La La La La Li
La La La La La La La La De Di De Di La La Li Li Li
La La La La La La La La De Di De Di La Di Da Di Di
La La la de di wo oh oh o...

After a year like this one
I'm surprised I am convinced at all and
After a year like this one
I do not roll my eyes at less than another

After a year like this one
I can't help but wonder how they've been and
After a year like this one
I think I'll leave it all to my next of kin...

CHORUS

After a year like this one
I'm surprised we're all not weeping drunks and
After a year like this one
I want you to choose the restaurant and then

After a year like this one
I'll need a good whole 16 months alone and
After a year like this one
I think I'll thank the west coast beaches I came home.

CHORUS
