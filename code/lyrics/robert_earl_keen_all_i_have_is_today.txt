Song:

I woke up in another strange place by a 40 acre parking lot with every kind of sign
I was talking to another strange face who was tellin' me that he didn't have the time

Chorus: All I want to do is climb that mountain; All I need is the other way
All I am is a lost soul, searchin'All I have is today

I was walkin' through the sands of silver to the Saphire canyon on the River of Jade
I was followin' a gold sun settin' when suddenly the light began to fade...
Chorus:

I was ridin' in a black Tornado with the top pulled down and the lights on dim.
I heard angels singin' in the darkness, singin' some Southern gospel hymn...
Chorus:

I was thinkin' 'bout a man and woman who were tryin' to make a livin' that Sammy wouldn't steal.
I should tell ya if I haven't told ya, this is exactly how I feel...
Chorus:
