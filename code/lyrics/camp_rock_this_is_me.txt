[Demi Lovato]
I've always been the kind of girl
That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say

But I have this dream
Right inside of me
I'm gonna let it show, it's time
To let you know
To let you know

[Chorus]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found cause who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

Do you know what it's like
To feel so in the dark
To dream about a life
Where you're the shining star
Even though it seems
Like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself
It's the only way

[Chorus]
This is real, This is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found cause, who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

[Joe Jonas]
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singing
I need to find you
I gotta find you

You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

[Both]

[Chorus]
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be, now
Gonna let the light, shine on me
Now I've found cause who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me

This is me... This is me...

[Joe Jonas]
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me

You're the voice I hear
Inside my head
The reason that I'm singing

[Both]
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me
