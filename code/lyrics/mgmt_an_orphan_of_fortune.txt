Song:

It can’t stop now
The signs keep changing on me
Like a shimmering bell
Long waves enveloping me
And my plastic mind,
So chewed and shrieking all the time
Feels it whirling by
Morning, afternoon then night,
And I can’t get down
If I don’t feel right
Polishing off the sand,
Lay by me
And we’ll erode
As gently as we can,
Into twilight
