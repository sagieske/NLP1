Song:

They don't see what I see
They don't believe in you and me
(They don't see, what I see they don't see what I see)
They don't feel what I feel
They're not here when your holdin me
(They don't feel what I see, they don't feel what I see)

We started out as friends then I became ya man
We went thru situations that started complications
And also altercations but you were still my lady
For that I love you baby
My momma overheard a conversation one day
Confronted me about it and I didn't know what to say
Told me I was crazy for having you as my baby
I didn't pay attention cause I think I'm in love with you

They don't se what I see
They don't believe in you and me
(They don't see, what I see they don't see what I see)
They don't feel what I feel
They're not here when your holdin me
(They don't feel what I feel, they don't feel what I feel)

My momma keep tellin you to stop callin
But only if she knew it was you I was fallin in love with
(Fallin in love with)
Then she would understand (she would understand that you are my special friend)
She's no angel nobody is
My piece or my girlsomethings gotta give (somethings gotta give)
Think I'm in love but you don't believe
With you is where I wanna be girl

They don't se what I see
They don't believe in you and me
(They don't see, what I see they don't see what I see)
They don't feel what I feel
They're not here when your holdin me
(They don't feel what I feel, they don't feel what I feel)

[Bridge:]
They don't know whatchu mean to me
(The way you hold me, the way you touch me the way you tell me you love me girl)
All I know is that they can't see
(you gotta be my everything whoa)

[With ad libs from Q:]
They don't se what I see
They don't believe in you and me
(They don't see, what I see they don't see what I see)
They don't feel what I feel
They're not here when your holdin me
(They don't feel what I feel, they don't feel what I feel)

[Over Chorus:]
They don't know what you mean to me
The more they try to break us up
The closer we seem to be
They don't know what you mean to me
It's like the more they try to hate on us
The more that we believe
