Song:

I'm... I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache

I eat cheese
But only on pizza please
And sometimes on a home made quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me
And I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love it when you say my name... e... ame

If you wanna know, here it goes
I'm gonna tell you there's
A part of me to show
If we're close I'm gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm... I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier
To let you take a guess
If the rest is what you wanna hear 
The things in my brain, my heart, 
Well you asked for it
For you're perusing, 
At times confusing, slightly amusing
Introducing me

Doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
Doo-doo 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo 
La-da-da-da 
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da Da

I never, trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word 'dude'
As noun or an adverb or an adjective
And I've, I've never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeroes on them
I love the sound of violins and making someone smile... e... mile

If you wanna know, here it goes
I'm gonna tell you there's
A part of me to show
If we're close I'm gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm... I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier
To let you take a guess
If the rest is what you wanna hear 
The things in my brain, my heart, 
Well you asked for it
For you're perusing, 
At times confusing, possibly amusing
Introducing me

Well you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time... e... ime

If you wanna know, here it goes
I'm gonna tell you there's
A part of me to show
If we're close I'm gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm... I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier
To let you take a guess
If the rest is what you wanna hear 
The things in my brain, my heart, 
Well you asked for it
For you're perusing, 
At times confusing, hopefully amusing
Introducing me

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
