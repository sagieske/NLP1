Song:

Ooh yeah
Yeah yeah

Our little conversations are turning into little sweet sensations
And they're only getting sweeter every time
Our friendly get-togethers are turning into visions of forever
If I just believe this foolish heart of mine

REFRAIN
I can't pretend that I'm just a friend
'Cause I'm thinkin' maybe we were meant to be

CHORUS
I think I'm fallin', fallin' in love with you
And I don't, I don't know what to do
I'm afraid you'll turn away
But I'll say it anyway
I think I'm fallin'(fallin') for you
I'm fallin'(fallin') for you

Whenever we're together, I'm wishin' that goodbyes would turn to never
'Cause with you is where I always wanna be
Whenever I'm beside you, all I really wanna do is hold you
No one else but you has meant this much to me

REFRAIN
I can't pretend (no) that I'm just a friend (I'm just a friend)
'Cause I'm thinking maybe we were meant to be

CHORUS
I think I'm fallin', fallin' in love with you (I)
And I don't, I don't know what to do (yeah, yeah)
I'm afraid you'll turn away (I'm afraid you'll turn away)
But I'll say it anyway (yeah)

I think I'm fallin', fallin' in love with you (I think I'm fallin')
And I don't, I don't know what to do (and I don't know what to do)
I'm afraid you'll turn away (I'm afraid you'll turn away)
But I'll say it anyway (anyway)
I think I'm fallin'(fallin') for you
I'm fallin'(fallin') for you

CODA
I'm fallin', I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin', fallin' for you
And I don't know what to do, yeah yeah
Fall, I'm fallin' for you
