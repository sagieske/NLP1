Song:

The full measure of your giving,
You don't yet understand.
A cupfull of living
That you hold in your hand.
The full weight of your loving
Makes me lighter than air
The tax I'm receiving,
Now I know that it never was there.

It started off just sticking around
With that wonderful feeling from you
Now there's finally someone telling me
I can really give too.

I know you know the feeling
That getting something for nothing is wrong.
Getting love is so easy
Giving love takes so long.

It started out just sticking around
With that wonderful feeling from you.
Now there's finally someone telling me
I can really give too.

I heard them say it at Christmas.
Now I can say it too.
The feeling of giving,
It's as good as I'm getting from you.
It's as good as I'm getting from you.
It's as good as I'm getting from you.
It's as good as I'm getting from you.
