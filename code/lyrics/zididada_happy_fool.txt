HAPPY FOOL

BLUEBIRD YOU FLY INTO THE SUNLIGHT TRY TO LIGHTEN UP YOUR MIND SOARING HIGH ABOVE THE MADNESS LEAVE THOSE WORRIES FAR BEHIND FREE YOUR MIND

CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SMILE IT COMES SO NATURALLY IF YOUR LAUGHING AT ME A HAPPY FOOL IS WHAT I'LL BE GONNA RUN TO WHERE THE SUN IS SHINING ON ME WANNA DANCE IN THE SEA A HAPPY FOOL IS WHAT I'LL BE AINT NO OTHER WAY TO BE

I DON'T NEED NO-ONE TO TELL ME HOW TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT WON'T FALL IN WITH YOUR CONVENTIONS BE MYSELF AND IT'S ALRIGHT I'M ALIVE

CHORUS

DON'T YOU-SAY IT'S JUST A WASTE OF TIME BECAUSE -WHAT I'VE GOT I KNOW IS MINE EACH AND EVERY DAY CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY

CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SMILE IT COMES SO NATURALLY IF YOUR LAUGHING AT ME A HAPPY FOOL IS WHAT I'LL BE GONNA RUN TO WHERE THE SUN IS SHINING ON ME WANNA DANCE IN THE SEA A HAPPY FOOL IS WHAT I'LL BE, BE A HAPPY FOOL WITH ME?
