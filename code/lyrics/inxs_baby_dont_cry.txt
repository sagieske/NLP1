Song:

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

When you're down and confused
Nothing seems right
And it's you who decides
Who's going to make it right

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Well life ain't no joke
But it's good when you smile
Steal everything
But you won't get far

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Sometimes you will fall
What cha gonna do?
Give your friend a call

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

We know that you can smile
Even though it takes a while
To lose your fears and say
Gonna lose your fears and say

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Do you know who you are
And where you're going to
Don't you know that love
Gonna pull you
Gonna pull you through now baby

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry

Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry, Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry. Baby don't cry

Face to face
Anything is possible
Not political, or analytical
Never givin up on the wrong
You got a choice
Why don't you use it
Change, is an attitude
Guaranteed to take hold of you
So welcome, to the turnstile
Take a turn with a new vow
Hey, I know what you know
All the sympathy
Made a mess of me
Respect the sacrifice
Before the number one
Now it has begun

Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
Baby don't cry
