Song:

We set sail at half past four,
Looking for a new tomorrow
Don't know when we're coming home
So we drink and we dance and we drown our sorrow

Chorus:
Whey, hey, hey laddy hey
Whey hey hey and we'll drink the night away

We don't know what there lies in store
But it's better than this, that's why I'm willing
To stake my claim on a foreign shore
With me spoons and me fiddle and half a shilling

Chorus

They've dreamt a place and I know it's true
Where the dolphins play and it's always pretty
They dance around in the old true blue
That's what you do but you make more money

Chorus

I must be off by morinng's light,
I can hear our bosun's whistle blowin
One more kiss and one more fight
And one more song while the beer is flowing

Chorus
Hey!

When the sky is grey look out to sea
When the waves are high and the light is dying
Well raise a glass and think of me
When I'm home again boys I'll be buying
