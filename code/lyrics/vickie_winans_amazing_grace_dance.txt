Song:

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free
Come on and let's dance

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
It's clear to see, I once was lost but now I'm free
So amazing was His love for me and you should jump to the beat

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
It's clear to see, I once was lost but now I'm free
So amazing was your love for me and you should jump to the beat

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

Throw your hands up high, don't be afraid
Let the spirit move you and give God the praise
The time is now and the time is right
To celebrate all day and all night

Come on, dance with me
Get on the floor and move your feet
'Cause grace brought you over change
Your life and set you free

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

Come on, dance with me
Get on the floor and move your feet
'Cause grace brought you over change
Your life and set you free

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free

[Unverified] it puts a smile on your face
[Unverified]
It's time to move so put yourself in the groove
I tell you now's your chance
It's called the amazing grace dance

Now throw your hands in the air right left
It shows the Devil you don't care fight back
Back it up on the beat 1 2 3
Now move it up like me 1 2 3

Y'all did good so I want y'all to sing with me
Open up your mouth everybody oh
Now throw your hands in the air right left
It shows the Devil you don't care, fight back

Back it up on the beat 1 2 3
Now move it up like me 1 2 3
Hands in the air right left
It shows the Devil you don't care, fight back

Back it up on the beat 1 2 3
Now move it up like me 1 2 3
Now throw your hands in the air right left
It shows the Devil you don't care, fight back

Back it up on the beat 1 2 3
Now move it up like me 1 2 3

Lift your voice and sing
I gotta brand new praise come and dance with me
Let the rhythm move through your feet
This body's dancing 'cause He set me free
