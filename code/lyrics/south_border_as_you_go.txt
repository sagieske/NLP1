Song:

All the leaves are dry
Time is changing tides
And there will be no stars tonight

Kissed your love goodbye
Tears are in my eyes
I'm not ashamed to cry

Why do I have to feeel this wayfair isn't always what
They say
Our dreams are meant to fade
These walls are meant to
Break
(Now we have set it free)
(Now this is what they say)
Love's not you and me

I know I'll get by
But I can still see you reappearing in my mind
Hearts will mend in time
Now that's what they say
When you can hardly sleep
At night
