Song:

No communication, static on the line
No one understands me when I speak my mind
I just get the feeling that I want to let go
Surrounded by the people, I don’t want to know

I think, why can’t we be alone?
You and I in the moonlight
All the signs peak to overload
And I can’t have my emotion

And I bite the hand that feeds
Hurt, the heart that leads me
Trying so hard to explain
Feelings deep within me

I got my suspicions, I could never win
‘Cause every step is taking me down that road again
I just get the feeling that I want to let go
Surrounded by the people, I don’t want to know

I think why can’t we be alone?
You and I with the lights down low
All the signs peak to overload
And I can’t have my emotion

And I bite the hand that feeds
Hurt, the heart that leads me
Trying so hard to explain
Feelings deep within me

Now I feel the same way about you
Maybe it’s my jealousy
That makes me feel the way I do

And I bite the hand that feeds
Hurt, the heart that leads me
Trying so hard to explain
Feelings deep within me

And I bite the hand that feeds
Hurt, the heart that leads me
Trying so hard to explain
Feelings deep within me

And I bite the hand that feeds me
Hurt, the heart that leads me

And I bite the hand that feeds me
Hurt, the heart that leads me

And I bite the hand that feeds me
Hurt, the heart that leads me

And I bite the hand that feeds me
Hurt, the heart that leads me

And I bite the hand that feeds me
Hurt, the heart that leads me
