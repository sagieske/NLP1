Blue Rain
Glenn Miller

Blue Rain, falling down on my window pane
But when you return there'll be a rainbow
After the blue, blue rain
And there's a blue star
Looking down asking where you are
But when you return there'll be a sunbeam
Hiding the blue, blue star
Skies will be much brighter than they were before
When you and love come strolling through the door
Then there'll be no more blue rain
Just the sound of my heart's refrain
Singing like a million little blue birds
After the blue, blue rain
