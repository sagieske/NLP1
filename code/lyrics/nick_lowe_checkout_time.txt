Song:

I’m 61 years old now, Lord I never thought I’d see 30
Though I know this road is still some way to go
I can’t help thinking of
Will I be beloved and celebrated for my masterly climb?
Or just another bum when to comes to checkout time?

I’m fearful my chances of crossing over Jordan into glory
May be compromised by the pies I’ve had my fingers in
Must I be condemned, forever damned for some long-forgotten crime?
Or singin’ “Rock of Ages” with the angels soon after checkout time.

Yes and when it’s time to pay the bill
I’m gonna get my bag and then I will
Go wait in the first cabby line (line)
Gonna make this the day to remember the checkout time

Must I be condemned, forever damned for some long-forgotten crime?
Or singin’ “Rock of Ages” with the angels soon after checkout time.
Checkout time
Checkout time
