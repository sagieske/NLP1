Song:

[Chorus:]
6 of 1 thing (uh)
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing (oh)
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing (oh)
Then you go and do another (uh, c'mon)
What you doin' to me

6 of 1 thing (uh)
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing (ha)
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another
Baby tell me why (c'mon, check)

[Verse:]
Why do you always front (lately)
Over nothin' baby
Actin' nonchalant (tell me)
Why you been trippin' out
Where's the love gone (baby)
All I know there's no more
Kissin' huggin', makin' lovin'
Romantic weekends in London

Used to always say (girlfriend)
I'm the only one that makes you happy
Tell me girl what's changed (since then)
Why we don't communicate no more
Leavin' me wide (open)
And it's so clear to see that
This ain't workin', that's for certain
Baby please just tell me somethin'

Why you actin' crazy, yeah
One minute crazy next thing everything cris
That's why I don't understand why you actin' like this
Baby why you actin' crazy
You're confusin' me, when you tell me baby

[Chorus:]
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another
What you doin' to me

6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another
Baby tell me why

[Verse 2:]
Why you always cryin' (lately)
Over nothin' baby
When all I'm doin' is tryin' (trust me)
Just wanna work this out
So hard to be strong (baby)
When it seems you're always
Boyfriend snubbin', girlfriends clubbin'
Baby please just tell me somethin'

Why you actin' crazy, yeah
One minute crazy next thing everything crisp
That's why I don't understand why you actin' like this
Baby why you actin' crazy
You're confusin' me, when you tell me baby

[Chorus:]
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another
What you doin' to me

6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another
Baby tell me why

[Bridge:]
This one dedicated to my peeps in the same.... As this
This one, I don't know, I ain't been here before
But I know I don't want to let you go
She's like this, one minute wanting to kiss
Next minute we both be fighting like this
It was never like that
You were just my girl and your boy had your back
But you're one in a million, just came off the rails though
Flipped off the track, tryin' to put you back on though
Just like a yo-yo, how relationships go
We kickin' out the door, but you're waivin' the four four
So unpredictable hard to follow
Specially when I don't know what the.... Is wrong
That why girl I'm so confused when your sittin' there sayin' baby baby

[Chorus:]
6 of 1 thing (uh)
Half a dozen of another (hey)
6 of 1 thing (uh, c'mon)
Half a dozen of another (oh)
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another (c'mon baby)
What you doin' to me (what you doin' to me)

6 of 1 thing
Half a dozen of another (yeah)
6 of 1 thing (uh)
Half a dozen of another (na na na na no no)
Tell me one thing
Then you go and do another (tell me what your doin' to me baby)
Baby tell me why (tell me what your doin' to me)

6 of 1 thing (uh)
Half a dozen of another (hey)
6 of 1 thing (oh oh oh, whoa oh)
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing (yeah, oh na)
Then you go and do another
What you doin' to me (what you doin' to me)

6 of 1 thing (yeah)
Half a dozen of another (uh)
6 of 1 thing (oh oh oh)
Half a dozen of another
Tell me one thing (hey)
Then you go and do another
Baby tell me why (uh, c'mon)

[Outro:]
I wanna know know know know know
Yeah
Na na na na know
Oh baby
What you doin' to me
La na na na know
La na na na know know

La na na na know know
