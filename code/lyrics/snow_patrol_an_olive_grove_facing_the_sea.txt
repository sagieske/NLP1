Song:

Sworn to secrecy I might go after school
She was an angel I saw her swimming there
I am in such a mess I can't cope without this
She just teases me pretends she can't see me here

So let me go out there
I can breathe fresh air
Stay with you all night
Just let me love you
Just for a while want to
Be with you all night
Be with you all night

Until I fall asleep
Just let me be here
I won't tell anyone

Don't want to wake up

The blind lead the blind so why can't I find my way
This could be heaven but I don't know where I am
I am too scared to come out from behind here
My body is aching it feels like it's wearing me
