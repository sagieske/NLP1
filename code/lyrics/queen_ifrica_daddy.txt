Song:

Stop it daddy
Daddy stop it nuh
A going to tell on you enuh

[Chorus: 2X]

Daddy don't touch mi there
I'm gonna tell on you one day I swear
Can't you see I'm scared
You suppose to be ma father

[Verse: 1]
Everyday a wonder why ma daddy had to be di one to take away my innocence
Oh sometimes a wanna die feels like no one cares for me and it's evident
That something must be wrong with me
I'm not as happy as I seem to be
The long showers I take don't wash away the memories
Why do I have to face these tragedies

We go thru struggles in life I'm aware
But to have ma daddy touching me that's just not fair
Stop him from destroying ma future
Believe me he's behaving like a creature

[Rpt chorus:]

[Verse: 2]
To all you mothers out there
Give a listening ear
Pay attention even if di man a pastor
Yuh affi mek sure before yuh trust him wid yuh daughta
Plus him will even try fi tek yuh son as brawta
Watch it mek mi duck him wid some dutty watah
Yuh cyaah hide nuh more now yuh affi meet yuh karma
If yuh know seh it a gwaan and turn a blind eye
Den yuh judgment ago pile up bout a mile high

Get suicidal if yuh tink it ago save yuh
Because mi sure seh yuh naah guh get fi si di saviour
Mi just cyaah find a name fi yuh behaviour
Is a lucky ting wi got a nosey neighbour

[Rpt chorus:]

[Verse: 3]
When yuh feel like giving up
Just shake it off and live it up
Di most high will deliver you

Cyaah jump di rope if yuh nuh try
Suh wipe da tears deh from yuh eye
Get di wings of confidence fi mek yuh fly

Tribulations a just fi mek yuh stronga
Love yuh self and it will help yuh fi get ova
Any flesh weh hurt a likkle yute will neva prospa
A passing on di message from di masta

[Rpt verse: 1]
