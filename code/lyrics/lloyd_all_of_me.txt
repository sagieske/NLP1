Song:

(Intro – Wale)
I appreciate your resistance shawty
I wouldn't f**k with me either
All of me that is

(1st Verse – Lloyd)
Hey girl, I like what you got on
How bout you take it off
It's just you and me don't be shy
Baby show me what you're working with
Damn you're so fine
I've never seen a body so divine
What you waiting on, come and get it
Baby I just want a little bit, better yet

(Chorus – Lloyd)
Take all of me
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all

(2nd Verse – Lloyd)
Where you going girl, don't run away
You was talking all that s**t the other day
Bout how you can take it and how I wasn't ready
Baby I think your mistaken
Cause you're over there, I'm over here
Now you're looking scared, watch it disappear
Told you Ima come correct
And I ain't even break a sweat
Girl I ain't even finished yet

(Chorus – Lloyd)
Can you take all of me
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all

(3rd Verse – Wale)
Hold up, Wale though
Love what she need
But a brova really just can't give in
But that's it what she bring
Got me thinking I can reconsider
Got me thinking she can be my Mrs
Got me thinking that I need to stop tripping
Smoke and talk about our pain
Drink until we in our feelings
Uh, what's rough for her is I like her when I like her
And she dislike the fact cause I like the fact that can't fight back
But she loves more
And she loves hard when she does so when I'm on and on
Cause the last time I said the last to my old flame was a false alarm
I know I know I'm not the best
A monogamy would be a optimist
And let God protect as far as having you
Give me half of you, He can have the rest
No promises believe it's all just game girl
Cause if I go inside that I bet you go insane girl

(Chorus – Lloyd)
Take all of me (work)
All of me
Cause I just wanna give you my all
So can you take all of me
All of me
Your body's telling me what you want
So Ima give it all (x3)
Yea, this that good ole top down
For you shawty, just you
So Ima give it all
