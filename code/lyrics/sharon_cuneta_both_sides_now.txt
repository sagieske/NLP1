Song:

Rows and flows of an angel
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow everyone
So many things I could have done
But clouds got in my way
Chorus:
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud's illusions
I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferries wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
Chorus:
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions
I recall
I really don't know love at all
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions
I recall
I really don't know life at all
