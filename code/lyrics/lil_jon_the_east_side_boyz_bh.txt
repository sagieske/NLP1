[Too $hort]
One time it's by Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz
Who we talkin to man, who we talkin to
Any n***a that act like a wha (bitch)
Any any b***h that act like a muthafuckin (bitch)
Any p***y n***a that's a muthafuckin (bitch)
I send this s**t out to all y'all man
F**k y'all p***y-a** ni***z
Playin there for the mothafuckin
Okay, this how we put this s**t down for y'all

[Chorus:]
We run this [x4]
You ain't fuckin wit me [x4]
Start a riot in this [x7]
Aw get the f**k out this

[Lil Jon]
You be actin like a b***h
So we treat you like a b***h
You be actin like a b***h
So we treat you like a b***h
We beat you like a b***h
Kick your a** like a b***h
We take your fuckin s**t
And leave you stuck like a b***h
You wearin panties like a b***h
Yo p***y like a b***h
You sound like a b***h
You talkin like a b***h
You cryin like a b***h
You whinin like a b***h
I hate you fuckin b***h
We'll kill you b***h

[Too $hort]
So back up on me in this b***h
Or get f****d up in this b***h
My ni***z real in this b***h
Sit your wig in this b***h
Crack your head in this b***h
Beat your a** is this b***h
So keep poppin let your mouth
And get f****d up like a b***h
Smack you up like a b***h
Stomp you out like a b***h
Slap your head like
Beat you down like a b***h
Take your money like a b***h
On your knees like a b***h
We don't like you fuckin b***h
We'll kill you like a b***h

[Chorus:]

[Chyna White]
Ain't no hoes fuckin with this b***h
I put years in this s**t
Shed tears for s**t
B***h I'm real with this s**t (don't push me)
'cause ain't no fuckin thang bout me p***y
Except this rare s**t that drip from me
I get money in my hood b***h ain't nuttin funny (not funny)
But a faggot n***a in nut huggers and big hoots
We toss over who got juice
Who livin a lie (lie)
Who speakin a true, who get that loot
You get on that mic with that bullshit b***h (boitch)
Then it's all on you
Hangin rap label (rap label)
I ain't dealin with favorites
Homie fucks with ni***z that do business up under the table
That mad shout
You hoes can't make it in the game
Unless your titties and your a** out
Now f**k wit me
So I can show you who already ballin in this b***h
Turnin from sweet to sour in this b***h
Like zero to 60 M. P. H.
It's a thin line between love and hate
And f**k the world
'cause I ain't here to stay (bitch)

[Chorus:]

[Lil Jon]

Get your mothafuckin security ready (f**k em)
Yo I think some s**t bout to go down n***a (what goin down nigga)

Lemme see you get crunk

Lemme see you tear that mothafuckin club on up
Lemme see you get crunk
