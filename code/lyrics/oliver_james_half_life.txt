Song:

I'm awake in the afternoon, I fell asleep in the living room
It's one of those moments when everything is so clear
Before the truth goes back into hidding
I wanna decide cause it's worth deciding
To work on finding something more than fear
It takes so much out of me to pretend
Tell me now tell me how
Make amens

Maybe, I need to see the daylight
Live beyond the half life
Don't you see I'm breaking down
O, lately.... Something here don't feel right
This is just a half life
Is there really no escape, no escape from time
Of any kind

I keep trying to understand
This thing and that thing my felo man
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out
I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that away
It's fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing
It takes too much out of me to pretend

Maybe I need to see the day light
Live beyond the half life
Don't you see I'm breaking down
O, lately... Something here don't feel right
This is just a half life
Is there really no escape, no escape from time
Or any kind

C'mon lets fall in love
Well c'mon lets fall in love
C'mon lets.... Fall in love.... Again

Cause lately, something here don't feel right
This is just a half life
Without you I get breaking down
O, wake me
I wanna see the day light
Save me from this half life
Let you and I escape
Escape from time

C'mon lets fall in love
C'mon lets fall in love
C'mon lets fall in love....... Again
