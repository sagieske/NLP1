Song:

We are broken
We can't fix it
There's no cure for our condition
Desperate eyes are staring at me
Should be hopeless but we're happy
It's not perfect here between us
Even angels have their demons
Trapped inside this twisted circle
It ain't right but it's eternals

There's a white light
And it's calling me
And it's promising ecstasy
But I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

We're not happy
But we're breathing
But this pain keeps my heart beating
We are lost when we're together
But I'll follow you forever


There's a white light
And it's calling me
And it's promising ecstasy
But I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

But I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

I don't wanna dream wihout you
I don't wanna be without you
I'll do anything you want me to
Cause I know you'll burn with me too
I don't wanna dream wihout you
I don't wanna be without you
I'll do anything you want me to
Cause I know you'll burn with me too

There's a white light
And it's calling me
And it's promising ecstasy
But I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

But I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

I don't wanna go to heaven
If you're going to hell
I will burn with you
I will burn with you

I don't wanna dream wihout you
I don't wanna be without you
I'll do anything you want me to
Cause I know you'll burn with me too
I don't wanna dream wihout you
I don't wanna be without you
I'll do anything you want me to
Cause I know you'll burn with me too

There's a white light
And it's calling me
