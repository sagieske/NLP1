Song:

Hmm
Mmm
All my life
I've waited for the right
Moment to let you know
I don't wanna let you go oh

But now I've realized
There's just no perfect time
To confess how I feel
This much I know is real

So I refuse to
Waste one more second without you
Knowing my heart

Baby cause I don't
Need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me
I'm incomplete

When you're not there
Holding me, touching me, I swear
All of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care
As long as you're there

Take these words
Don't let them go unheard
This is me reaching out
I hope you can hear it now

Cause baby my heart's at stake
Take it
It's yours to break

I'd rather try and lose
Than keep this love from you
Yeaah

So I refuse to
Waste one more second
Without you
Knowing my heart

Baby cause I don't
Need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me
I'm incomplete

When you're not there
Holding me touching me I swear
All of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care
As long as you're there

Each day and night
That I've kept this a secret
It'd killed me
It's time
To share what I feel, 'cause

Sunshine with Vocal Adrenaline:
I don't
Need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me
I'm incomplete

When you're not there
Holding me touching me I swear
All of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care
As long as you're there
(Vocal Adrenaline: As long as you're there)
As long as you're there.
