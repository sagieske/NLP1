Song:

Well Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he kick it in the head when he was twenty five
Speed jive, don't want to stay alive
When you're twenty-five

And Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
And Freddy's got spots
From ripping off the stars from his face
Funky little boat race

The television man is crazy
Saying we're all juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh, man I need TV
When I've got T Rex, I'm a dude dad

All the young dudes
(Hey dudes)
Carry the news
(Where are you)
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up, stop)
Carry the news

(Hey dudes)
All the young dudes
(I want to hear you)
Carry the news
(I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes
(I want to talk to you, all of you, hey)
Carry the news

Lucy's lookin' sweet
'Cause he dresses like a queen
But he can kick like a mule, it's a real mean team
But we can love, oh yes we can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
What a drag, too many snags

Now I've drunk a lot of wine and I'm feeling fine
I'm gonna race some cat to bed
Oh, is there concrete all around or is it in my head
Brother you guess I'm a dude

All the young dudes
(Hey dudes)
Carry the news
(Where are you)
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up, stop)
Carry the news

(Hey dudes)
All the young dudes
(I want to hear you)
Carry the news
(I want to see you)
Boogaloo dudes
(I want to talk to you, all of you)
Carry the news
(Hey with you dude)

(Hey dudes)
All the young dudes
(Where are you)
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
(Stand up)
Carry the news

(Hey)
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news

(Hey dudes)
All the young dudes
(I wanna see you)
Carry the news
(Where are you)
Boogaloo dudes
(I want to talk to you, all of you)
Carry the news
(Stand up, hey)

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
