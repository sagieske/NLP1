[By Jack Starr]

[1st verse:]
When you see her walking down the street
Don't look at her that way
She ain't no fool, she ain't no easy lay
Just get out of her way

Don't try to call her she's never home
She don't like being alone
Ain't got no chains she's got to be free
That's the way it should be

[Chorus:]
Not another face on your T. V. Screen
Not another girl in your magazine
Not another part of your porno dreams
She's your next door neighbor
An American girl

[Bridge:]
She's an American girl
She's an American girl

[2nd verse:]
So keep your sweet talk and your phony smiles
She hears them all the time
We're sick and tired of playing this game
Ooh - we're going insane

[Chorus:]
Not another face on your T. V. Screen
Not another girl in your magazine
Not another part of your porno dreams
She's your next door neighbor
An American girl

[Bridge:]
She's an American girl
She's an American girl

[Fadeout:]
Lookout, ooh yeah
You're never gonna let her
Ah yeah, she blows you away
Ooh, here we go
Just an American girl
