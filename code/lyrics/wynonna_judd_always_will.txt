Song:

If time is a train rollin' down the track
Every minute is a box car that don't come back
Take a look around you, it's all gonna change
Whatever you see ain't never gonna stay the same
Except for the rain and the wind in the trees
And the way I feel about you and me

(chorus)

And the way I feel when I'm with you
Is like the roll of the ocean
And the calm and quiet of the moon
And when you hold me time stands still
It always has and you know it always will

Out on the horizon the sun is goin' down
It ain't gone, it's just on it's way around
Just like your love I see it every day
In the things you do and the things you say
You touch my hand and I feel the thrill
I always have and I always will

(repeat chorus twice)

You know it always will
You know it always will
