Song:

I feel it comin
By the touch of your body
I feel the hunger deep in me
You hear the rain fall
I hear your body call
You pick me up and you take me home
Uh - cool lover
You eat me with A smile
You keep me hangin on
- hangin on to you
Uh - cool lover
You break my heart in two
And I can't get ebough
- get enough of your love
Cause you're the one that I'm dreaminof
Uh - night after night
Late at night
Upstairs in your bedroom
You give me your heart
Under the light of A sad moon
Our feelings go crazy
And you're tasting so sweet
And our dreams fade away
Into A wonderful sleep
Uh - cool lover...
When the next days awakin
My head is aching,
And the sheets are empty - you are gone
So I buy me A ticket
For the next train to the city
Where my friends are waiting
To leave this town,
And I feel it comin
With the wind of this morning,
As it takes me away - away from you
Cause another towns waiting
Another dawns breaking
And there's no road that leads me back to you
Uh cool lover...
