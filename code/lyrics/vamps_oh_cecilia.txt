Song:

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily

Put your hands up
You're surrounded
The whole love thing
I clowned it
Then who's the joker?
I guess I'm it
‘Cause I let it right go when I found it

Time has never been my best suit
Now I've got everything except you
You moved out of my heart, still got the bruise
I'd give it all back to be next to you

I turn my radio up and it's just my luck
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh me?
I turn my tv on, it's the same old song
Why are you following me?
It's like a ‘missing you' sign
Is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It's like everybody knows
Cause everywhere I go
The whole world is singing to me

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

I had the girl of my dreams
And now she's all gone
Thought that we could last forever
I was all wrong
Said the talking was cheap and now I'm flat broke
She don't even wanna see my face anymore
She don't wanna say
Where she's gone away
But she's on replay
In my, in my brain
I'll do what it takes
Any time and place
We can turn a breakup into an outbreak

I turn my radio up and it's just my luck
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh me?
I turn my tv on it's the same old song
Why are you following me?
It's like a ‘missing you' sign
Is written on my face
Why-y-y-y-y-y-eh?
It's like everybody knows
‘Cause everywhere I go
The whole world is singing to me

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

Although we're many miles apart but I still feel her
There'll never be another one like my Cecilia
Oh where, oh where could she be?
Does she still care about me?
When will she finally come back to, come back to me?

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh
Uh-uh-uh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
