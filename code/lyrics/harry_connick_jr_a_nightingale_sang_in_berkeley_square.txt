Song:

That certain night, the night we met
There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the ritz
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square

I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in berkeley square

The moon that lingered over london town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love
The whole darned world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And as we kissed and said good-night
A nightingale sang
A nightingale sang
I know 'cause I was there
That night in berkeley square
