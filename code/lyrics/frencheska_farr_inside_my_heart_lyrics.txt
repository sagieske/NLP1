Song:

I am nobody with no sense at all
Pale as the mountain, cold as the shore
Tried reminiscing, alone imagining
What if I come to you
Then I stood up making the hours
Gazing the sunsets, watching the stars
Sparkling, smiling hello to my eyes
These as you come to me

Inside my heart is you
No greater love, no one above you
Inside my heart is you
Stay in love always, as I live in your ways
'Cause inside my heart is you

Play with the raindrops, lie on the sand
Sail through the ocean, chasing the clouds
Showed me completely what life is about... 
I left with no worries flying so high

Inside my heart is you
No greater love, no one above you
Inside my heart is you
Stay in love always, as I live in your ways
'Cause inside my heart is you

The end of all waiting, my new beginning
'Cause you have loved me this way

Inside my heart is you (ooh...)
No greater love no one above you
(No one above you, ooh...)
Inside my heart is you
Stay in love always, as I live in your ways
'Cause inside my heart is you

Now I know the meaning
It's love you creating
The love in my heart is you

Inside my heart is you...
