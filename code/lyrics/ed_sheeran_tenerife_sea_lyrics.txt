Song:

You look so wonderful in your dress 
I love your hair like that 
The way it falls on the side of your neck 
Down your shoulders and back 

We are surrounded by all of these lies 
And people who talk too much 
You got the kind of look in your eyes 
As if no one knows anything but us 

And should this be the last thing I see, 
I want you to know it’s enough for me 
Because all that you are is all I’ll ever need 

I’m so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 

You look so beautiful in this light 
Your silhouette over me 
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the Tenerife Sea 
And all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath. 
Just say the word and they’ll all disappear into the wilderness 

And should this be the last thing I see, 
I want you to know it’s enough for me 
Because all that you are is all I’ll ever need 

I’m so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 

Lumiere, darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 
Lumiere darlin’ 
Lumiere over me 

And should this be the last thing I see, 
I want you to know it’s enough for me 
Because all that you are is all I’ll ever need 

I’m so in love, so in love, so in love, so in love 

You looked so wonderful in your dress 
I loved your hair like that 
And in the moment I knew you better
