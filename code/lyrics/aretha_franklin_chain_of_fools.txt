Chain Of Fools

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain... Chain... Chain..)
(Chain of fools)

For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out, I'm just a link in your chain
Oh, you got me where you want me
I ain't nothin but your fool
Ya treated me mean
Oh you treated me cruel

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain
Chain of fools)

Every chain, has got a weak link
I might be weak child, but I'll give you strength
Oh, babe
(Woo, woo, woo, woo)
You told me to leave you alone
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
My father said 'Come on home'
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
My doctor said 'Take it easy'
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
Oh but your lovin is much too strong
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
I'm added to your
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain... Chain... Chain...)
Chain of fools

Oh, one of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until then yeah
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh babe

Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain... Chain... Chain...)
(Chain of fools)

Oh!
(Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain)
(Chain, chain, chain)
Oh-oh!
(Chain, chain, chain, -ain, ain, ain, ain)
Your chain of fools
Fades-
Oooooooooooooooooh......
