[Lead:]
I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You more and more…
I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You, Lord, more and more…

[Group:]
I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You more and more…
I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You more and more…

(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more

I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You more and more…
I'm chasing after You, no matter what I have to do
‘Cause I need You more and more…

(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more
(Lead – more and more) More and more

I'm chasing after You
Praising my way through, yeah
Just to be closer to You, Lord
I'm chasing after You, Lord

[Group:]
I'm chasing after You
I'm praising my way through
Just to be closer to You
I'm chasing after You

[Invert Chord]

I'm chasing after You
I'm praising my way through
Just to be closer to You
I'm chasing after You
[Repeat 2X]
