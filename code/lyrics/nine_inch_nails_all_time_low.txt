Song:

Go! I've heard all I need to know
Your voice in f*****g echo stereo
This particular scenario
Looks like another all time low

Why did you go and let them in
See this where the fun begins
You barely even kissed the skin
Just wait till you see what is going in

Get down on the floor
Shut the god below
You've felt this all before
You're coming back for more

So give me just a little baby
Just something to get by
It's gonna last forever baby
And get the other side
And we will live forever baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you baby
We're never gonna die

Hey! Everything is not ok
We lost too much along the way
The passengers around today
It looks as though they're here to stay
It's turning all your time to fear
This too is whispering in your ear
Pretending but I know you hear
Cause I'm the f*****g end of here

So give me just a little baby
Something to get by
Something to get by
It's gonna last forever baby
It's gonna last forever baby
And get the other side
And we will live forever baby
And we will live forever baby
And stretch across the sky
And stretch across the sky
I follow right behind you baby
I follow right behind you baby
We're never gonna die

We're never gonna die
How did we get so high high high high
High high high high high high
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
