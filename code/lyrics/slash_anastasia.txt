Song:

Blood red sky on a desert road
Gotta make my way down to Mexico
For what I did, I know that it was wrong
The fire in my heart it will never die
Everything I love will be left behind
No turning back, forever gone tonight

All my love Anastasia, Anastasia 
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

All I need is a miracle
Lawmen got me running now forevermore
They'll hunt me down until the end of time
Oh my mama, now I've got to go
Never love another how I loved you so
I'm so afraid to leave this all behind

All my love Anastasia, Anastasia 
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

(Solo)

All my love Anastasia, Anastasia 
This may be our last goodbye
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

Anastasia, Anastasia
For your honor took a life
You can't save me
I am fading
Blood is on my hands tonight

(Solo)
