Song:

Stuck inside these four walls,
Sent inside forever,
Never seeing no one nice again
Like you, mama,
You, mama,
You.
If I ever get out of here,
Thought of giving it all away
To A registered charity,
All I need is A pint A day.
If I ever get out of here,
If we ever get out of here.
Well, the rain exploded with A mighty crash
As we fell into the sun.
And the first one said to the second one there,
"I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING FUN!"
Band on the run,
Band on the run,
And the jailer man and sailor sam,
Were searching ev'ryone,
For the band on the run,
Band on the run,
For the band on the run,
Band on the run.
Well, the undertaker drew A heavy sigh,
Seeing no one else had come.
And A bell was ringing in the village square
For the rabbits on the run.
Band on the run,
Band on the run,
And the jailer man and sailor sam,
Were searching ev'ryone,
For the band on the run,
Band on the run.
Yeah, the band on the run,
The band on the run,
The band on the run,
Band on the run.
Well, the night was falling as the desert world
Began to settle down.
In the town they're searching for us ev'rywhere
But we never will be found.
Band on the run,
Band on the run,
And the county judge, who held A grudge,
Will search forever more,
For the band on the run,
For the band on the run,
The band on the run, yeah,
The band on the run, yeah
