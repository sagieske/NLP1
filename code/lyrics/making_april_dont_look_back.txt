Song:

You're getting weak in your decisions
The ones that wake you just to say goodnight
And there's nowhere to run from them this time
If there's nothing I can say to break you free of all your fears
Then why am I still here?
Well there's that charming face you wear so well
And I know that you don't wanna stay
So why don't you just pack up and come with me?

You've gotta hold on now
Don't let your eyes look down
When we're gone from here this wont feel lost at all

And there's not a day that I can say that I've
Been playing every card that I've been dealt
But I know how it feels and how you felt
When the world was at your back and things were never stacked up right
But you put up a fight
There's a light that peers through darkening skies
And I know that you wanna be free
So why don't you spread your wings and fly with me?

You've gotta hold on now
Don't let your eyes look down
When we're gone from here this won't feel lost at all
You've gotta hold on now (you think that I've got it wrong)
Won't let our lives touch ground (but this is where I belong)
I've been hoping you would just come through
With the days you said that
We'd be on our way back
To the ones we knew so little of this year, yeah yeah yeah

You've gotta hold on now
Don't let it all come down
When we're gone from here this won't feel lost at all

You're wishing me all of the best
I just wish you would drop your regrets
And come back to this place I know
Will be the place you can never let go
