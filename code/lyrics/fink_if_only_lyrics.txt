Song:

I ain't being funny, I ain't got the brakes
I ain't got the aces, I ain't got the stakes
If Only
I ain't got the nerve, I ain't got the makings of
The man you deserve, I ain't got the time
If Only

I'll be right on the train, up to town to, take you out again
Right on the train, first one outta here, to take you out again

I ain't got the bullshit, and I ain't got the lies
I ain't got the memories of tears in your eyes
If Only
I'd be right on the money, I'd be right on time
I'd be right about everything that's bin all on my mind
If Only

I'll be right on the train, up to town to, take you out again
Right on the train, first one outta here, to take you out again

You got a new man, and he sounds great
I got a new girl who treats me right
If Only

I'd be right on the train, first one out
Up to town to take you out
Again
