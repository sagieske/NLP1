Song:

Oh, the moon goes round the earth (earth x5)
And the moon controls the tide (tide x5)
And the earth goes 'round the sun (sun x5)
And the sun provides the light (light x5)

And the light makes most of life (x2)

If my friends were a crowd, it might not be the biggest but it'd be
Definitely loud
And if my enemies were an army, it'd try to take us down, deaf, dumb and
Proud.
Yeah deaf, dumb and proud
Yeah deaf, dumb and proud (proud x7)

Oh, the cat chases the mouse (mouse x5)
And the mouse just wants a home (home x5)
And the dog chases the cat (cat x5)
And the cat wants to be alone (lone x3)

And all the animals have souls guiding their bones
Yeah, all the animals have souls guiding their bones

If my friends were a drug, not one of them could afford it
But it's already in their blood, and if your enemies cause the cancer
We'll find a cure for you then bring it to the club
Yeah, bring it to the club (x2)(club x7)

I walked alone
Until we met
Then we (we x3)
Walked against
The earth
Until we met
And you (you x3)

I walked alone
Until we met
Then we (we x3)
Walked against
The earth
Until we met
Oh you (you x3)
I walked alone

(Music break)

Oh, the moon goes round the earth (earth x5)
And the moon controls the tide (tide x5)
And the earth goes 'round the sun (sun x5)
And the sun provides the light (light x5)

And the light makes most of life (x2)

(He makes like, this weird sound and stuff. I like it)

Background: The earth goes 'round the earth goes 'round the sun (repeated)

I walked alone
Until we met
Then we (we x3)
Walked against
The earth
Until we met
And you (you x3)
I walked alone

I walked alone
Until we met
Then we (we x3)
Walked against
The earth
Until we met
And you (you x3)
I walked alone

I walked alone
Until we met
Then we (we x3)
Walked against
The earth
Until we met
And you (you x3)
I walked alone
