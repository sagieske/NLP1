(Do it. Do it. Do it now. Do it.)

Late on Tuesday evening such a commotion in the street
Someone broke a window and someone's head got beat
A wave of breaking bottles crashed across the city street
And someone got arrested for a breach of the peace

If you wanna walk, don't talk, do it
If you wanna earn, learn how to do it
And if you wanna ride, don't hide, do it
If you wanna stay, don't say, prove it

How much longer you gonna sit and talk to me?
You've got so many problems and a split personality
You want to see a doctor before our love is tested
How much longer? A man could get arrested

If you wanna walk, don't talk, do it
If you wanna earn, learn how to do it
And if you wanna ride, don't hide, do it
And if you wanna stay, don't say, prove it

You got your health, you got everything, that's what my doctor said
You may not have much cash but you've got a roof over your head
Of course I said I loved you not just 'cause you insisted
How much longer? A man could get arrested

If you wanna walk, don't talk, do it
If you wanna earn, learn how to do it
If you wanna ride, don't hide, do it
If you wanna stay, don't say, do it, do it

Oh babe, why don't we do it now?
Do it now
Oh babe, why don't we do it now?
Why don't we do it now?
Oh babe, why don't we do it now?
Why don't we do it now?
Why don't we do it now?
