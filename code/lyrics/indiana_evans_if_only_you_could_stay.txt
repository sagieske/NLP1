Song:

And I've been thinkin' over
All the things that you've been sayin' to me
No reason or answers
Do I deceive myself when I'm making out to be

[Chorus:]
I thought I'm the girl with everything
If only you could stay
Only you could stay around a while for me
Thought I had it all and anything
I wanted you, to really matter

And I find myself searching
Through the days and all that you meant to me
I'm playing with fire
Will I burn inside when your passion lights for me?

[Chorus:]
I thought I'm the girl with everything
If only you could stay
Only you could stay around a while for me
Thought I had it all and anything
I wanted you, to really matter

When all is said and done for me
There is no other one for me
Cause every time you speak
I feel my eyes drifting all around you

(Instrumental)

When all is said and done for me
There is no other one for me
Cause every time you speak
I feel my eyes drifting all around you
