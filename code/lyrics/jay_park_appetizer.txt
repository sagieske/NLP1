Chacha
Aom & 1lli, rrah

I built this s**t from the ground up
And can I mention there will be no 9/11 you can never break me down son
Work hard
Play hard
Serve bars
Stay sharp
Always on the go even though my name is Jay "Park"
I'm on your radar from Sydney to Bangkok, Seattle to Seoul spittin' Guru
Knowledge "Gang Starr"
There's a growin gap between us cause I'm spittin space bars
Swimming in women and I do not need no safe guard
I kill mics man you'll be seein' casualties
Money good looking boy I get paid handsomely
I be drinkin' crown so you can call me majesty
Your girl whack me off and you? You're just whack to me
You think I give a f**k though?
I be feeling real hard like my homies cut throat
Even though it's all love throw you off this love boat
So the only question is: Will I f**k you up? Nooo
But I ain't a b***h though
While you're hatin' on me boy I be getting rich bruh
Get your broad on me on the worst way ooh
See them "cakes" when I get her in her birthday suit
Got me stiffer than a surfboard
So I'm fu***n' her tonight
She be yellin' "world star"
And I ain't even in a fight

With these words man I dance on a beat
With these words man I dance on a beat
With these words man
With these words man
With these words man I dance on a beat
Man I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie what, what
Yeah I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie what, what

I cherish life man breath by breath
I go out and just do it I ain't living check to check
These kids on the block only take it step by step
Man I ain't no psychic but you bet I'm next
Aww yeah Don't get it twisted like contortionists
If you don't see my vision boy then you better focus in
Notice it this ain't boastfulness blow it up with explosiveness
Leaving oceans all motionless recognize I'm the "golden kid"
So you better call Ed Murphy
Drunk up in the fast lane yeah I'm swervin'
Schooling muthafuckaz boy yeah you learnin'
Flow hot on these heat waves yeah I'm surfin'
I'm not perfect but you know I keep it real
Always coughing up these raps so you know I keep it ill
You can call me George Foreman 'cause I'm all up in your grill
Man the game is my prey and I'm goin' for the kill damn
Waddup

With these words man I dance on a beat
With these words man I dance on a beat
With these words man
With these words man
With these words man I dance on a beat
