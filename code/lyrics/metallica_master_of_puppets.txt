End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction

Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets
I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Blinded by me
You can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master
Master

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

Needlework the way
Never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer

Pain monopoly
Ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets
I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Blinded by me
You can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master
Master

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master, master, master, master...

[Bridge:]

(1st solo - James)

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?

Master, master
Promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter

Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries

Fix me!

(2nd solo - Kirk)

Hell is worth all that
Natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason

Never-ending maze
Drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master

Master

Master of puppets
I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams

Blinded by me
You can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master
Master

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master

(Outro, random laughter to fade)
