Song:

Ooh, ooh, ooh, it's something
You and I have something
How I long to be around when
When you can see that
You and I have something

Come on, oh, oh, it's something
You better believe it
And I'm sure of one thing
How I long to be around when
When you can see that
You and I have something

And come on, it's been a revelation, yeah
You've been an inspiration to me
And there is not one question, no
And my heart will run to you

Oh, oh, it's something
You better believe it
You and I have something
I don't wanna lose this time, babe
And hope you can see that
'Cause you and I have something

In my heart I can't believe we've been so blind
Looks like we've wasted so much time
There's not a doubt that rings untrue
Said when I'm with you

Oh, you and I got something
Come on, oh, oh, it's something
Oh, you and I, we got something
Come on, oh, oh, it's something
