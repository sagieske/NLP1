[Intro:]
Finally Famous in this

[Verse:]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try to tell you how to run your s**t
And they're ain't s**t
Do yourself a favor and kick 'em out.
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night it's all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B. I. G. That before March ninth
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
Now I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Be the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting lobbys out, you know?
Stuntin' like a b***h, prime night to be out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
It's crazy how much you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything, and still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on more than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have more than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way, two lyin and one b
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm X, Jessie Flaxon, front of the plane I'm talkin Rosa Parks
V. Swervin like it's O. J. Oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Take extra shots for my dogs missin out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still don't have it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, f**k.
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all tricked out
