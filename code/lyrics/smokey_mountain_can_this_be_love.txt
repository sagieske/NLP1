Song:

Can this be love I'm feeling right now
I know for certain I'm feeling right now
I don't recall ever feeling this way
Tell me what does one say
To one who makes me feel this way
Can this be love I'm feeling right now
I am not sure of this feeling somehow
Why do I tremble whenever you're near
I can't seem to say my words so you'll hear

[Chorus:]
This is the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'
It's the first time I ever felt so helpless deep inside
If I had to say a thousand times I'd tell you once again
This is the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'

Can this be love I'm feeling right now
I love the feeling it's giving me now
A voice inside me is guiding me now
It's telling me now
To take your hand and say

[Chorus:]
This is the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'
It's the first time I ever felt so helpless deep inside
If I had to say a thousand times I'd tell you once again
This is the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'
This is the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'
It's the first time I ever felt so helpless deep inside
If I had to say a thousand times I'd tell you once again
This is the first time
This is the first time
It's the first time I'm gonna say 'i love you'
