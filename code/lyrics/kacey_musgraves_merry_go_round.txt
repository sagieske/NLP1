Song:

If you ain't got two kids by twenty one
You're probably gonna die alone
At least, that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning, you'd best be there
In the front row like you're supposed to

Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry-go-'round

And 'round and 'round we go, 
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowing down
This merry-go-'round

We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want, it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you wear

Same checks are always cashed in
To buy a little more distraction

'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We get bored, so we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry-go-'round

And 'round and 'round we go, 
Where it stops, nobody knows
And it ain't slowing down
This merry-go-'round

Mary, Mary, quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
Just like dust, we settle in this town
On this broken merry-go-'round

Merry-go-'round

Jack and Jill went up the hill
Jack burned out on booze and pills
Mary had a little lamb
Mary just don't give a damn anymore
