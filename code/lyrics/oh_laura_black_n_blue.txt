Song:

I'm on the outside looking in, it's how I pay for all my sins
The list is long as my left arm
I always thought it would be cool if I could walk all over you
And have you fall for all my charm
A taste of my own medicine
I tell you it's a bitter pill

Beat me black and blue, as long as you forgive me
As long as you forgive me
Lock me in your room, as long as you're with me
Well honey, there ain't nothing I won't do

I don't know how I failed to see, you were a step ahead of me
I didn't see the bigger picture
I can't belive I let it slip
I always thought I had a grip, I guess the devil's in the details
A taste of my own medicine
I tell you it's a bitter pill

Beat me black and blue, as long as you forgive me
As long as you forgive me
Lock me in your room, as long as you're with me
Well honey, there ain't nothing I won't do

Beat me black and blue, as long as you're with me
Well honey, there ain't nothing I won't do
