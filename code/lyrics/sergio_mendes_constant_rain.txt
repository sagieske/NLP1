Song:

Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain

As I stand here and remember
When once our hearts were one
And everyday was spring to me
To be loved and to go on the sun

Now the days are lonely
The song of love is still
They say that I will forget you
But I say I never will

And it hurts with such a pain
To be alone and lonely in the rain
And it hurts with such a pain to be
Alone and lonely in the rain

Chove, chuva
Constant is the rain
Chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
Chove, chove, chove, chuva
Endless is the pain
