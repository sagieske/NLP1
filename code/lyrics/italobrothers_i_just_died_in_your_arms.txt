Song:

I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lay all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
A diary sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed
The cats in the cradle who would've thought
That a boy like me could come to this

(I just died in your arms tonight)
(It must've been something you said)
(I just died in your arms tonight)
I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
