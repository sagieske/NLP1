Song:

Verse 1:
Seems like everybodys got a price, 
I wonder how they sleep at night.
When the sale comes first, 
And the truth comes second, 
Just stop, for a minute and
Smile 

Why is everybody so serious! 
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good
Time.

Pre-chorus:
Everybody look to their left (yeah)
Everybody look to their right (ha)
Can you feel that (yeah)
We're paying with love tonight... 

Chorus:
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the Price Tag.

Ain't about the (ha) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.
Aint about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the Price Tag.

Verse 2:
(Listen, Okay.)
We need to take it back in time, 
When music made us all UNITE! 
And it wasn't low blows and video Hoes, 
Am I the only one gettin... tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed?
Money can't buy us happiness.
If we all slow down and enjoy right now
Gurantee we'll be feelin
All right.

Pre-chorus.

Everybody look to their left (yeah)
Everybody look to their right (ha)
Can you feel that (yeah)
We'll pay them with love tonight... 

Chorus:
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the Price Tag.

Ain't about the (ha) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching.
Aint about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
Wanna make the world dance, 
Forget about the Price Tag.

Yeah yeah
Well, keep the price tag
And take the cash back
Just give me six strings and a half stack
And you can, can keep the cars
Leave me the garage
And all I... 
Yes all I need are keys and guitars
And guess what, in 30 seconds I'm leaving to Mars
Yeah we leaving across these undefeatable odds
It's like this man, you can't put a price on a life
We do this for the love so we fight and sacrifice everynight
So we aint gon stumble and fall never
Waiting to see, I've seen a sign of defeat uh uh
So we gon keep everyone moving their feet
So bring back the beat and then everyone sing
It's not about

It's not about the money, money, money
