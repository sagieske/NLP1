Verse 1:
I’m just a simple man, doing the best I can
Up there are campers in their bed
I hit this open road,
It’s like a rollercoaster
I don’t know how to steer
Got money, but I ain’t got time
Tryin’ to quit both, but I dropped the line
Don’t worry girl, you’re on my mind today
Had soul from the very start
Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart
And everyone asked if Ima be your king

Chorus:
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
I got fresh bread chops, a couple of bucks
And I just don’t give a f*ck
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Well it ain’t where ya from, it’s where ya at
And I’m never looking back

Our only witness is the empty sky
Late nights and early flights
He’s gonna catch up to me
My only sleep is on the plane
Just out somewhere unknown
Speeding through dusty roads
We make our way through pouring rain
Got love but I ain’t got time
Shine ... It’ll please my mind
Don’t worry about me, I’m fine my friend
I’ll say uh huh
Had soul from the very start
Can you lead a revolution with a broken heart
Only one way to find out, so sing

Chorus:
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
I got fresh bread chops, a couple of bucks
And I just don’t give a f*ck
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Well it ain’t where ya from, it’s where ya at
And I’m never looking back now
Our only witness is the empty sky

Only bags I got are under my eyes
Guess I gotta look on the bright side
On the pool side sipping Mai Thais
Pelegrino out in Reno, sunset, skylines
Spend a week in the Palm Spring Army
Got a car with no roof to see the palm trees
Couple pretty girls, all they wanna do is party
Another morning, I’m walking ’round like a f*cking zombie
So what, hurting only gets better
Only need a couple friends, and good weather
Roof top, red cups, better last forever
Let the good times roll like I landed on something
Headcrack, that’s me at the table
At the Trowicano, with the limo, out waiting
Living every day like I’m on vacation
And if you wanna ride, start singing

Chorus:
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
I got fresh bread chops, a couple of bucks
And I just don’t give a f*ck
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Hell yeah, uh huh, uh huh
Well it ain’t where ya from, it’s where ya at
And I’m never looking back now

Our only witness is the empty sky
Let me sing it again now
Our only witness is the empty sky
