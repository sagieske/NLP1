Song:

Whoa-ooh!
Chocolate drop

I got a long tall woman
They all call, the chocolate drop
I've got a long tall woman
We all call, the chocolate drop
She's a long tall woman
Boys, she just won't stop

(harmonica & instrumental)

She's a brown-skinned woman
She look like somethin' fit to eat
Look-a-there!
She's a brown skinned woman
She look like somethin' fit to eat
She's a chocolate drop woman
She sho' looks good to me

Blow!

(harmonica & instrumental)

Come 'mere, baby
Sit down on my knee
Come 'mere, baby
Sit down on my knee
You the chocolate drop woman
Baby, you worry me

Blow!

(harmonica & instrumental to end)
