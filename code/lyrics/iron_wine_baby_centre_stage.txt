Song:

Mama called you baby center stage
She could really run her mouth
Baton Rouge called you petit ange
And Birmingham could run you out

Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was running you down
But the world kept spinning round
Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time when you were running to me,
But the lightning spared the tall tree

When your moon lights up the riverside
Making mud and bad blood
You can call me anytime
For all it’s worth, Louisiana’s still not enough

In your restless days,
I got lost, I got saved
In your restless nights
I swam blind,
Somehow falling into the light

Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time I was running you down
But the world kept spinning round
Doesn’t anybody see how scared you are?
There was a time you were running to me
But the hurricane had mercy

In your restless days
All that wind, all those waves
In your restless nights
We closed our eyes,
Killed each other and came to life

In your restless days
I made my bed, I dug my grave
In your restless nights
We both swam blind,
Somehow falling into the light
