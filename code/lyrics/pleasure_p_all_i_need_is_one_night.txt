Song:

Now damn the lights and relax yourself
When your body closer to me time to show and tell
I've been waiting all night long
I told the DJ play this song for you

And I don't really care what anybody else says about you, oh no
'Cause you're the only one I want in my bed tonight, oh I, oh I
And I don't think of you any differently girl tomorrow
And make it alright, make it alright

Six shots at five o'clock
Let the four play at tree across
How about the two of us making crazy love
All I need is one night to make it alright, to make it alright

And I don't really care what anybody else says about you, oh no
'Cause you're the only one I want in my bed tonight, oh I, oh I
And I don't think of you any differently girl tomorrow
And make it alright, make it alright

She was beautiful walking all week and the cuba call
Hard day so tonight no new of all, she was doing foe
I bet the blue it all in my true dough
Ahh, bought tender, pour around for I tell em I'm a sender
Ice cold Patron in the system, at least attention girl

'Cause I wanna make the night feel epic
Let em fall I'ma fill it up tatris
On and every nigga is just don't get it
Night Spanish 'cause we gonna vanish

Got the six shots at five o'clock
Let the four play at tree across
How about the two of us making crazy love
All I need is one night to make it alright, to make it alright

And I don't really care what anybody else says about you, oh no
'Cause you're the only one I want in my bed tonight, oh I, oh I
And I don't think of you any differently girl tomorrow
And make it alright, make it alright
