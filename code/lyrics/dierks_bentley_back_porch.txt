Song:

Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah

Ain't no line around the corner, no security
No velvet rope, no dress code, everybody's vip
You can wear your hat, dance in your bare feet
No credit card, no roll of cash, just B. Y. O. B

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swing
Them good ole boys pickin' six strings
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch

Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah

Got a tin roof on the top just in case it rains
Got a kiddie pool off the deck for those hot-as-hell days
Got beer on ice all day, all night
Now, if that sounds like something you like, c'mon

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swing
Them good ole boys pickin' six strings
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swing
Them good ole boys pickin' six strings
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, chillin' on a back porch
Little hottie swingin' up in the swing
Them good ole boys pickin' six strings
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, leave your trouble at the door
No cover charge, get in for free
No last call, let's party on a back porch

Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
Yeah, on a back porch
Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
Little hottie swingin' up in the swing
(Little hottie swingin' up in the swing)
Them good ole boys pickin' five strings
(Good ole boys pickin' five strings)
No cover charge (no cover charge)
Get in for free (get in for free)
No last call (No last call)
So let's party on a back porch

Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
Chillin' on a back porch, oh, yeah
