Song:

The rose
(Amanda Mcbroom)

Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger, an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower & you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
Its the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken, who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely & the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky & the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the
rose
