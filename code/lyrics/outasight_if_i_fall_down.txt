Song:

Welcome to the good life
Making toasts another good night
I'm sure this is what it looks like
But do know that I fought the good fight
Back when I was in the trenches
Collecting dust sitting on the bench and
This can't be the place preventing
But it was my time I was spending

I'm sure you know the feeling when your hands reach the ceiling
I'm losing all my worries
This sky is in the hurries
Yep, So it's back to basics the morning comes and I'm back to chasing the
Same old thing with the same old basis but there's not one thing I would
Change man

[Chorus:]
Running and running
But I'm already here
Waiting for something but for what it's not clear
Running and running but I'm never scared
You better Pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you Understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

(End of chorus)

Welcome to my story
Before the songs before the glory
There was a boy, didn't count as boring
Who let go with the fear he's holding
Walk down of all his classes
Followed his so called passion
Everyone said he was crazy
And they were right but that was back then

I'm sure you know the feeling when your hands reach the ceiling
I'm losing all my worries
This sky is in the hurries
Ya back on the chase
Once in a bill gotta slow your pace
Take a look around and appreciate all the good things that come to those
Who wait

[Chorus:]
Running and running
But I'm already here
Waiting for something but for what it's not clear
Running and running but I'm never scared
You better Pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you Understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

(End of chorus)

If I fall down x3

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you Understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down

I'm taking a stand I hope you Understand
Work this round

You better pick me up x3
If I fall down
