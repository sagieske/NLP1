Song:

Baby, your love
Makes me feel so good
It's got me doing things, baby
I never dreamed I would

But we got to check ourselves
Cause we belong to someone else

And I can't leave your love alone
I just can't leave your love alone
When you chuck your love on me
It's got me begging and crying
Wrecking every bone in my body
Lord, just tearing up my mind

It's been sunk in too deep
And it's become a big part of me
I can't leave your love alone
I just can't leave your love alone

I know this slipping around
Can be a dangerous thing
But we got to keep on
Taking these chances

I got my good luck piece in my hand
Hoping they won't catch us
Won't chase us red-handed, oh

The effect of your love
Leave me shook up after you're gone
Setting fire to my clothes
Leaving my body so warm

But I know what we're doing is wrong
But I can't leave your love alone
I just can't leave your love alone
Oh, Lord, I can't leave your love alone

All of my friends try to tell me
But I just can't leave your love alone
Oh, no, no, I can't leave your love alone
It's got me, it's got me, it's got me so bad
