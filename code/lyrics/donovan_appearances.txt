Song:

Can't get the shake together with the rock
Movin' her body before she can talk
People say you get nowhere till you walk
But you feel and you hurt and you love
Yes you feel and you hurt and you love
You got the legs to strut it on down
Parade your pretty self in the town
Won't be too long now and you'll get around
For to feel and to hurt and to love
For to feel and to hurt and to love
Don't let appearances fool you
Life's not what the rule book tells
Don't let appearances fool you
Feel the vibes as well
Feel the vibes as well
Now you're a woman, you must use it
Well
Shakin' your pills at the wedding bell
People say you get nowhere till you
Smell
But you feel and you hurt and you love
You do feel and do hurt you do love
