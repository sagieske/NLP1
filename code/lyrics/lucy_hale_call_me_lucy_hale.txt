Song:

Color me your color baby
Color me your car
Color me your color darlin'
I know who you are
Come up off your color chart
I know where you're comin' from

Call me
On the line
Call me call me any any time
Call Me my love
When your ready we can share the wine

Coover me with kisses baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come I don't know why
Cover up loves aliby

Call me
On the line
Call me call me any any time
Call Me my love
When your ready we can share the wine

Any time any place anywhere any way
Any time any place anywhere any day

Call me
On the line
Call me call me any any time
Call Me my love
You can call me any day or night
Call me
