Song:

Painted picture
Skies are falling
As our bodies hit the ground
I see you whisper
Are you calling?
Because I didn't hear a sound

Can you feel it trembling?
Beneath you it all comes apart
Can you feel it ending... Can you?

I'll keep pretending
That this isn't ending
But it all depends on me

This is our little love song
This is our corner of the world
Just the last little love song
That will ever be heard

Perfect moment
Earth spinning faster
While our hearts were standing still
Souls colliding
With heat astounding
But now we feel the morning chill

Can you feel it trembling?
Beneath you it all comes apart
Can you feel it ending... Can you?

I'll keep pretending
That this isn't ending
But it all depends on me

This is our little love song
This is our corner of the world
Just the last little love song
That will ever be heard

Atoms fly
It's do or die
I've seen the signs
Made up my mind
It's almost time
Atoms fly... It's do or die
All of this ends tonight

Can you feel it trembling?
Beneath you it all comes apart
Can you feel it ending... Can you?

I'll keep pretending
That this isn't ending
But it all depends on me

This is our little love song
This is our corner of the world
Just a last little love song
It will never be heard
