Song:

Can't stop the rain from falling
Each time the sky decideds to cry
Can't stop the sun from shining
Until the day turns into night

All over the world
They try to steal our joy
But our spirit can't be broken
Every man and woman, girl or boy

Refrain:
Can't stop the joy
Can't stop the reason
Christmas lives inside of us
From season to season

Can't stop the pain
Of all the hated in the world
There'll be no hate, no war
In God we'll trust
And peace on earth
Cause you can't stop Christmas

There's a feeling we share
We never knew it, but it always was there
For united we will stand
Brother to brother hand in hand

With one song, one dream, one prayer
Let your voice be heard
For his blessings surround us
All across the world

Can't stop the joy
Can't stop the reason
Christmas lives inside of us
From season to season

Can't stop the pain
Of all the hated in the world
There'll be no hate, no war
In God we'll trust
And peace on earth
Cause you can't stop Christmas

Reach out for those in need
For that magic of Christmas
Is to give and to believe...

Repeat Refrain
