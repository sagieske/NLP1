Song:

A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

Well a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money, if you'll be my honey
Here's what I'll offer you

A well I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
A yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you
If you will agree

And I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes I'll give you love
That's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy
