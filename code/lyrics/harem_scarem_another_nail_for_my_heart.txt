Song:

(Chris Difford / Glenn Tillbrook)
The cases pulled from under the bed
She made a call to a sympathetic friend
And made arrangements
The door was closed there was a note
I couldn't be bothered
Maybe I will tell her all the engagements

For where we went and faraway grounds
Trying to be good by not being around
So in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart
And in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart

I had excuses those little boy lies
That she compured by watching my eyes
And told me firmly
She couldn't stand at battle of heart
She tried to make up
And now I found a bottle that concerns me
I thought about a time
My love has resigned
I visit you poured out love you divide
So in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart
And in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart

That should be no bug that kills our love
I want to be good inside my nuts
So play that song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart
So play that song that makes it so tough
Another nail for my heart
And in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart
And in the bar the piano has found
Another nail for my heart
