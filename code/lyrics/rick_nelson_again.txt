Song:

Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill devine

What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine

Mine to hold, as I'm holding you now
And yet, never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters dear

For when, this doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again
