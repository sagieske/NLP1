Song:

It was Labour Day weekend, I was seventeen.
I bought a Coke and some gasoline,
And I drove out to the County Fair,
When I saw her for the first time,
She was standing there in the ticket line
And it all started right then and there

Oh a sailor's sky made a perfect sunset,
And that's a day I'll never forget.

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee-shirt,
And she was killin' me in that miniskirt.
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks.
She had a suntan line and red lipstick.
I worked so hard for that first kiss,
And a heart don't forget, something like that.

It was five years later, on a southbound plane.
I was headin' down to New Orleans,
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras,
When I heard a voice from the past,
Comin' from a few rows back.
And when I looked
I couldn't believe just what I saw
She said "I bet you don't remember me",
And I said "only every other memory".

I had a barbeque stain on my white tee-shirt,
And you were killin' me in that miniskirt.
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks.
You had a suntan line and red lipstick;
I worked so hard for that first kiss.
And a heart don't forget something like that.

Like an old photograph,
Time can make a feeling fade...
But the memory of the first love,
Never fades away

I had a barbecue stain on my white tee shirt
She was killin' me in that miniskirt
Skippin' rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss
And a heart don't forget, no a heart don't forget
I said a heart don't forget something like that

Oh, not something like that
