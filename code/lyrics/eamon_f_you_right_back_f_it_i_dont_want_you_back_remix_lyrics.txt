Song:

Nooo Ohhh
No No No

You know there are two sides to every story.

See I don't, know why
You're crying like a b***h,
Talkin s**t, like a snitch,
Why'd you, write a song 'bout me,
If you really didn't care, you wouldn't wanna share
Telling everybody just how you feel.

F**k what I did, was your fault somehow,
F**k the presents, I threw all that s**t out,
F**k all the crying, it didn't mean jack,
Well guess what yo, f**k you right back,

F**k what I did, was your fault somehow
F**k the presents, I threw all that s**t out
F**k all the crying, it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, f**k you right back

You thought, you could,
Really make me moan, (moans)
I had better s** all alone, (laughs)
I had to, to do your friends,
Now you want me to come back,
You must be smoking crack,
I'm going elsewhere,
And that's a fact

F**k all those nights, I moaned real loud,
F**k it, I faked it, a ritual
F**k all those nights, you thought you broke my back,
Well guess what yo, your s** was whack,

F**k all those nights, I Moaned real loud,
F**k it, I faked it, a ritual
F**k all those nights, you thought you broke my back,
Well guess what yo, your s** was whack,

Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah

You question, did I care?
Maybe I would have
If you woulda gone down there.
Now its, over,
But I do admit I'm glad, I didn't catch your crabs,
I can't sweat that, cause I'd got to go,

F**k what I did, was your fault somehow
F**k the presents, I threw all that s**t out
F**k all the crying, it didn't mean jack
Well guess what yo, f**k you right back

Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah
Oh oh uh-huh yeah

You made me do this
