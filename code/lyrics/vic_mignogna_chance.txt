Song:

It seems I've been waiting forever
Looking for you so long
Love in my life was a gamble
I've been playing my cards all wrong

Now I know there's another
Made it here before me
But he's not all you'd hoped for
Maybe you'd soon be free

I tried to show you my open heart
Show you what true love could be
While we talked of a brand new start
He kept you away from me

[Chorus]
Now am I never gonna get a chance
Am I never gonna have a prayer
Will I never see the moment I've held so tight
Of waking in the night and finding you there
Will I never get to show you the way I feel
And know that you feel it too
Am I never gonna get my chance with you

Mustn't talk of tomorrow
It'll be here too fast
You'll be holding another
I'll be holding onto the past

Not too old to be love sick
Not too young to be sure
I wanna feel this forever
Don't wanna find no cure

And I love everything you are
Everything you've ever been
What's inside when it died
I knew I could bring it to life again, but

[Chorus]
Now am I never gonna get a chance
Am I never gonna have a prayer
Will I never see the moment I've held so tight
Of waking in the night and finding you there
Will I never get to show you the way I feel
And know that you feel it too
Am I never gonna get my chance
Get my chance
Get my chance...

I don't know how to make you stay
But I know we understand
What it means that we tremble
At the touch of each other's hand, but

[Chorus]
Am I never gonna get a chance
Am I never gonna have a prayer
Will I never see the moment I've held so tight
Of waking in the night and finding you there
Will I never get to show you the way I feel
And know that you feel it too
Am I never gonna get my chance... with you
No, no, no
No, no...
