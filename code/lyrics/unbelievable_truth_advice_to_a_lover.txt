Song:

Advice to a lover
You don't have to suffer
Relax into your new life
Instinct is the enemy
Of all you have been taught
But now it's your only guide
And always remember
To be fully in control
Let go for a moment
And the turbulence takes hold
But yes it's worth it
I think
Really it's worth it
I don't know
Sometimes the feeling
Of utter contentment
Gets too much
But to worry about it
Is the ultimate luxury
And always remember
That it pays to lose control
Relax for a moment
Let the turbulence take hold
So yes it's worth it
I think
But then what do I know?
Not much
Just a little as anyone
Probably than you.
