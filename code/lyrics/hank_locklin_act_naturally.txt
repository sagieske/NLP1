Song:

They're gonna put me in the movies they're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star might win an Oscar you can never tell
This movie's gonna make me a big star cause I can play the part so well
I hope you'll come to see me in the movies
For then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time and all I gotta do is act naturally
And all I gotta do is act naturally
