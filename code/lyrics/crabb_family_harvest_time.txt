Song:

Verse I
See the grain yellow in the field, the setting sun shines down to reveal
Night's closing in and it's harvest time
Pick up your sickle don't hesitate, if we delay we're sure to be late
The clock keeps ticking and we're behind
It's harvest time

Chorus
Can't you hear the many voices crying?
No hope, no God, they're dying in sin
We can't afford to stop our preaching
On the other hand we can't stop reaching out for them
We must bring them in

Verse ii
There are those out there and they are searching, no joy, no peace and they are hurting
We must bring them in, it's harvest time
We have the message of hope and mercy, the well of grace still flows for the thirsty
The sun is going down and it's harvest time
