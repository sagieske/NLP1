Song:

You have that wild side,
You’re an animal tonight
I see that you are my type (wild like a tiger, hunting the prey real)
Keep the neighboors up all night (hot in the jungle, exotic, apparel)

I Can see the way that you’re looking at me
Like you’re hungry and I’m the only thing that you see
Won’t tame you, love the way you watching me (watching me)

Baby I’ll keep you up all night,
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Animal, animal,
Baby Imma lock you in my cage
And I won’t stop until you behave
Animal animal.

Baby i’m gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal animal
Animal, animal
I’m gonna tie you up in case you bite
I’m an animal animal
Animal, animal

I don’t mean to blame you,
I’m just trying to entertain you (animal, animal)
I don’t mean to blame you,
I’m just trying to entertain you (animal, animal)

You’re a hunter, feel your way
I’d do whatever you say
Hold me down and take control (mess up my hair, crazy sexual)
Do it like an animal (hot in the jungle, exotic, apparel)

I Can see the way that you’re lookin’ at me,
Like you’re hungry and I’m the only thing that you see
Won’t tame you, love the way you watchin’ me (watching me)

Baby I’ll keep you up all night,
Gonna tie you up in case you bite
Animal, animal
Baby Imma lock You in my Cage
And I won’t stop until you behave
Animal, animal

Baby i’m gonna keep you up all night
Like an animal animal
Animal, animal
I’m gonna tie you up in case you bite
I’m an animal animal
Animal, animal

I don’t mean to blame you,
I’m just trying to entertain you (animal, animal)
I don’t mean to blame you,
I’m just trying to entertain you (animal, animal)
