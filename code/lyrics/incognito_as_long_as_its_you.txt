Song:

Something 'bout april, that makes me come alive
May have been the winter that made my heart so still
It must have been, must have been
What wakens us all to wonder, I don't really know?
But the best days of my life are the one's I spent with you

So continue to surprise me, baby I'll do the same for you
I won't question why it feels so good
I'll let the mistery be

As long as it's you
As long as it's you
Any time, anywhere, I don't care
Just as long as it's you

Thank you for your understanding
I know my love can be demanding
(I know that I can)
Yes I know that it means so much to you
Baby when I treat you right
And I'm holding you tight
Tears of joy come to your eyes
Like stars about to fall
Continue to still want me, the way that I still want you
I won't question why it feels so good, I'll let the mistery be

As long as it's you
As long as it's you
Any time, anyplace, I don't care
Just as long as it's you
