(ian hunter)

Girl-things ain't been goin' too good for me
Girl-I'm living in the middle of a mystery
You're the only one that can turn me on

'n' now that you're gone I said
Girl-I'm livin' in the middle of your memory
Girl-you're still the figure in my favorite fantasy

I know you know
That's the way it goes
And still my love grows-i said

All o' the good, all o' the good ones are taken
All o' the good, all o' the good ones are taken

I'm hangin' around with my head in the air
Watchin' the lovers go by
I had a lover-but she never cared
All you could say was goodbye

Maybe I was mistaken
Maybe I got it wrong

But all of the good ones are taken from now on
'n' girl-I'm livin' in the middle of a broken dream
I said girl-all this fallin' in love ain't like it seems

Out in the rain-can't you feel my pain
Again 'n' again 'n' again 'n' again 'n' again

All of the good, all o' the good ones are taken
Maybe I was mistaken-maybe I got it wrong
But all of the good ones are taken in my song
