Song:

I don't see you laugh
You don't call me back
But you kiss me when you're drunk
I don't know your friends
Don't know where you've been
Why are you the one I want

Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay
Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay
Don't say it doesn't mater cause it's gonna matter to me
I can't be alone with
You've got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can't be alone with you

Pleas don't chain that door
I can't win this war
Your body's like a pill I shouldn't take

Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay
Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay
Don't say it doesn't mater cause it's gonna matter to me
I can't be alone with
You've got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can't be alone with you

I can't be alone with you

Don't put your lips up to my mouth and tell me you can't stay
Don't slip your hand under my shirt and tell me it's okay
Don't say you're gone love me cause you're gonna love me and leave
I can't be alone with
You've got me out on the edge every time you call
And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can't be alone with you

I don't see you laugh
You don't call me back
But you kiss me when you're drunk
