Song:

I can feel the beat now
Lost in emotion
VERSE 1:
Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for their love that I might be getting
But my dreams have yet begun
Oh, baby
Am I a fool 'cause I don't know
Just how you feel
And my sweet love for you
Oh I, can't conceal, no
CHORUS:
I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things
You really should know oh, baby I'm
Lost in emotion
Am I a fool atleast my friends think so
Que sera, que sera
Baby, forever we'll be
Que sera, que sera
Between you and me
VERSE 2:
Just how true are the rumors I'm hearing
About this crush you have on me
Baby I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they say
I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friends
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us
From time to time I wonder where I am
In your heart
And even though I don't live there yet I'm afraid
It'll be cold and dark I'm
CHORUS
BRIDGE:
Am I a fool 'cause I don't know
Just how you feel
And my sweet love for you oh I
Can't conceal
Hit the beat now
With this feeling
I hit the ceiling
With deep emotions
I can't be dealing
I wanna be with you
But I don't know how
You're in my heart babe
I can feel the beat now
CHORUS
