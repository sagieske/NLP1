I like the way you work
I like the way you're teasing me
I wanna be your fantasy

Girl I like the way you move
Seen you from across the room
I feel your body close to mine
The temperature is rising now
Fancy cars and neon lights
Take us to another height
So how about we spend our lives together
Forever

She's so right pure delight
I just wanna hold her tight
Feel my body shaking cause I like it (I like it)
Don't think twice be my wife
Take a trip to paradise
I wanna make you satisfied
'Cause you're the one I like

Baby I like the way you work that body for me
You do it so sensationally
I like the way you're teasing me
Girl I'd like to take you on a journey with me
I wanna be your fantasy
I wanna be your everything tonight

Girl we're getting closer now
Don't be shy, just let it out
I'll take you on a magic ride
We can do it every night
Feel your body hot like fire
Girl you wish is my desire
So tell me what you like and I will be there
I'll be there

She's so right pure delight
I just wanna hold her tight
Feel my body shaking cause I like it (I like it)
Don't think twice be my wife
Take a trip to paradise
I wanna make you satisfied
'Cause you're the one I like

Baby I like the way you work that body for me
You do it so sensationally
I like the way you're teasing me
Girl I'd like to take you on a journey with me
I wanna be your fantasy
I wanna be your everything tonight

Tell me what you wanna do
Girl I'm waiting for a sign
There's a feeling in the air
And I like it
It's a physical attraction
Got to make it understood
Call a friend or two
For a rendezvous
We can party all night long

Baby I like the way you work that body for me
You do it so sensationally
I like the way you're teasing me
Girl I'd like to take you on a journey with me
I wanna be your fantasy
I wanna be your everything tonight
