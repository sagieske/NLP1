All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl
When I walk thru the door I'm a debutante
When I come thru the door I'm a debutante

The jet is freaking, the guest list is peakin'
We jet to Ibiza, the people are shrieking
The world kids are cravin' a ravin' invasion
I come from the future of next school new wavin'
Ny is so fly, my high rise is so high
The height of my high style comes right from the turnstile

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl
When I walk through the door I'm a debutante
When I come through the door I'm a debutante

The comic guru otaku, Tokyo
Dj come dj go,. Elevate electro,
London is burning turntables are turning
Nightclubs are discerning my lust is returning,...
????

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl
When I walk thru the door I'm a debutante
When I come thru the door I'm a debutante

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl
When I walk thru the door I'm a debutante
When I come thru the door I'm a debutante

All that you want, I'm debutante,
All that you want, live wild & free!!!

(the comic guru otaku, Tokyo
Dj come dj go,. Elevate electro,
Ny is burnin' turntables are turnin'
Nightclubs are discerning my lust is returning

All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl
All around the world
Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl
Zippers & your pearls, hey girl

All around the world, Hey girl, hey girl, hey girl!!!
