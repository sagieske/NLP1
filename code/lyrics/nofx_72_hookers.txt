Song:

They don't hate us, they just hate their lives
And desperate people, learn to despise
The suicidals, don't want a coup
They don't wanna blow up
They just want their 72

72 virgins can never stop a war
But 100, 000 hookers can beat the Marine Core
And stopping hatred, fighting will cease
When everyone is getting blowjobs
That's when we'll finally have world peace

How many million men, have been killed in foreign wars?
We need to reinstate the draft, enlist a million whores
Start with sororities, and all the spring breaks
Ship the girls gone wild to Afghanistan
They'll gladly blow the Sheiks
These holy wars aren't holy
It's not the military complex
Terrorist are 16 year old kids
Who were promised Jihad s**

Maybe, if they could see a woman's face
They might not get on to that plane
With a bomb in their suitcase

72 virgins can never stop a war
But 100, 000 hookers can beat the Marine Core
And stopping violence, fighting will cease
When everyone is getting blowjobs
That's when we'll finally have world peace.
