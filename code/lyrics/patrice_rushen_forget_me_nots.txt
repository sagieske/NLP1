Chorus:
Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last
Memories of love and affection
Never really was just like a dream
Was it the simple things
That made me so crazy about you
Was it your charm or your passion
It's not hard to believe
I love you and i need you so i... (chorus)

Did we give up too soon
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance we could love again
[she'll always love you forever]
It's not hard to believe
I want you and i need you so i... (chorus)

(instrumental break)

Sending you forget me nots
Baby please forgive me not

(repeated by backing singers over which)

Good times we had...
They weren't so bad
What a life we shared (?)
Pretty baby I still care
