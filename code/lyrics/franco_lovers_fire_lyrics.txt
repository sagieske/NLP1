Song:

Realizing how you’re more delectable
When sheets unfold
Your wicked pose

You’re crawling slowly on your knees
To beg for me
It makes me weak
To know this beat

Oh you gently touch me
Like nobody else can do
Oh you mesmerize me
I feel the magic in you

Love's so inviting when we groove
To set the mood
You sinful food
You taste so good

I feel the rising of the heat
That lights the mood
It burns for you
It burns for two

Oh you turn the key in me
I feel desire for you
Oh you mesmerize me
I feel the magic and love

Come slowly down, down over me
Come slowly down
And love, come slowly down
Down over me
Come slowly down

We move from side to side
And in and out the gloom
And into plume
In the bedroom

I feel the rising of the heat
That lights the mood
That burns for two
It burns for you

Oh you fill the need in me
I feel the fire in you
And your love's the heat, lady
A sexual healing and love

Come slowly down, down over me
Come slowly down
And love

Come slowly down
Down over me
Come slowly down
