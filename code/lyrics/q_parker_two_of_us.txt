Song:

You got your own mind, own type, 
Girl I swear sometimes you just be all mine, all mine
You're still my baby
That's cause whatever it is you ain't faded
Girl I swear I went traded for nothing, 
You are the one I want.

Pre chorus:chorus:
Now I know it don't always see things the same way
I say right, you say left, always thinking of what's best for me
Even though it drives me crazy, you're so amazing
'Cause I can't see it with nobody else.

Chorus:
We may fight, we may fuss, we may fight
But at the end of the night, 
Nothing's bigger than the, than the two of us, yeah
I got your back and you got mine, 
So all the thing's is alright
Ain't nothing bigger than the two of us, two of us.

No way, no way, ain't nothing bigger, nothing bigger, 
No way, no way, than the two of us.

The funny thing about us, we always fussing bout something
But one thing, you don't have to question boy is my love, 
No one even comes close to you, 
And believe you got me like you do.

Pre chorus:chorus:
Now I know it don't always see things the same way
I say right, you say left, always thinking of what's best for me
Even though it drives me crazy, you're so amazing
'Cause I can't see it with nobody else.

Chorus:
We may fight, we may fuss, we may fight
But at the end of the night, 
Nothing's bigger than the, than the two of us, yeah
I got your back and you got mine, 
So all the thing's is alright
Ain't nothing bigger than the two of us, two of us.

No way, no way, ain't nothing bigger, nothing bigger, 
No way, no way, than the two of us.

We may around prepare of dance, let it down, 
But at the end... you stuck around, stuck around
Ain't always easy, but it's always worth it, 
Ain't back one lover... 
We may fight

[2 x chorus:]

No way, no way, ain't nothing bigger, nothing bigger, 
No way, no way, than the two of us.
No way, no way, ain't nothing bigger, nothing bigger, 
No way, no way, than the two of us.

Oh baby, my baby, oh boy, oh yeah
