Song:

I feel like a midnight train running out of track
It's going boys but it ain't coming back
I've got money running through my hands like water down the drain
I get worried every time it rains

But I'm trying hard to go down easy
And it's a crying shame to live this way
Oh but baby comes and then it goes right on down the line
When you're living on borrowed money, working on borrowed time

But I'm trying hard to go down easy
And it's a crying shame to live this way
Oh but baby comes and then it goes right on down the line
When you're living on borrowed money, working on borrowed time

Yeah baby loves those diamond rings that keep me in the red
She don't know we're hanging by a thread
But she knows she's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
She's still gonna be here when it's gone

But I'm trying hard to go down easy
And it's a crying shame to live this way
Oh but baby comes and then it goes right on down the line
When you're living on borrowed money, working on borrowed time

Said I'm living on borrowed money, working on borrowed time
