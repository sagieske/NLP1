Song:

Your ex is back in town
What you gonna do when she comes around
And she starts going through her act
Will she make you to you change your act
Will your love for me remain intact
Or will you run to her

Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't you change it

You say your love is true
Whatcha gonna say when she looks at you
Will the seconds in your head
Make you take back the thing you said
Will you give me real despair
Or will you stay with me

Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't you change it

I will exit and take a bow
But I don't want to do it now
So I'm thinking someway somehow
Baby, you'll stay with me

Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it, don't change it

You know she's not the staying kind
Baby, don't ya change your mind
Don't change it
You know my love is genuine
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it

Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
