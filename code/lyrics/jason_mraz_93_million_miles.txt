Song:

93 million miles from the sun,
People get ready get ready,
Cause here it comes it's a light,
A beautiful light,
Over the horizon in to your eyes

Oh, my my how beautiful,
Oh my beautiful mother,
She told me
"Son in life you're gonna go far,
If you do it right you'll love where you are.
Just know that wherever you go,
You can always come home"

240 thousand miles from the Moon
You've come a long way to belong here,
To share this view of the night,
A glorious night,
Over the horizon is another bright sky

Oh, my my how beautiful,
Oh my irrefutable father,
He told me,
"Son sometimes it may seem dark,
But the absence of the light is a necessary part.
Just know, no you're never alone,
You can always come back home"

Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...

You can always get back...

Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand you can hold on to.
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your home's inside you.

Just know that wherever you go,
No you're never alone,
You can always get back home.

Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...
Ohh... Ohh...

93 million miles from the sun,
People get ready get ready,
Cause here it comes it's a light,
A beautiful light,
Over the horizon in to your eyes...
