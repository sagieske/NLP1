Song:

When all is said and done,
Where will you be?
You'll be staring right back, right back at me
Never, never talk back to me
Quiver at the sound
That we scream

Never been a fan of goodbyes
You know that
I'd rather leave you here to die
You know that

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel

You're bitter
You can't get over me
Deliver her body back to sea

Won't let you be the death of me
You know that before it's over you will see the waves' crash

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel
You won't be leaving anytime soon
You're sewn into my veins
I'm left with all the memories behind the broken frames

Far away, far away
I can see your face
Out of flames you fly
Out of broken frames
Silence words you cry
Left to wonder why I'm waiting

And when you say my name
You get the best of me
I feel, I can feel
You won't be leaving anytime soon
You're sewn into my veins
I'm left with all the memories
Behind the broken frames (X2)

Behind the broken frames,
You're sewn into my veins.
