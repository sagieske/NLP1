(Lil' Wayne)
Hey mama
Kick him out da bed I'm coming over
Got something to show ya behold ya eyes
I juz wana hold you, just hold you tight
Like a four leaf clover I be goin thru
Your flowers baby, ur gardens open
A sight for sore eyes
Good lord I'm focused
I can hardly notice anything other then a woman with a face of my future baby mother

(Robin Thicke)
I'm a big man she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty we can get bad
Shes a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream she's a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Lets play rough we can get wild
I could go home but I'll stay
Cheat but I wont

(Lil' Wayne)
So I go by weezy love me or leave me
I hate to leave her
I think I need her
She's such a teaser
Such a diva
I could park it right here baby the f**k ya need a?
Do it to me baby I could be your reciever
Call me in the last minute I could be your believer
Call me at the last minute I be that even
Late night, early morning, or maybe this evening

(Robin Thicke)
She ain't no stunt she aint no philly
I wanna get mad but then not really
Cause she's so fly I could get mine
But I do it much better with her by my side
Loves alright
We gone get blitzed tonight
All my girls wanna make that money
All my thugs wanna take that money
All night long I'm a milk that honey so

All night long I wait 4 your lovin babe
All night long I wait 2 tear you 2 pieces
All night long I wait 4 your lovin babe
All night long I wait all night long
All night long I wait
2 see you naked
And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait 4 you 2 play
And let my open arms take you away

(Lil'Wanye)
Ye ya ya she said she want to, be the one I get next to
Yes boo, lets do that who that? You that
When I want to be the one I get next to
Lets move, get you to the crib
Now I see you was the
One I want to give s** to
S** you
S*** you
You s*** devil you,
Angel
Lookin like your single
Thank you
Have yourself a drink, I
Drink too saw you when I came through
Now I can't do nothing if it ain't you
Its wayne boo, I don't do what them lames do
I come at you from a whole nother angle
Now one time for the ladies in the high skirt
Two times for the ladies in the tight jeans
Three times for the ladies who ain't got no panties on
Lets go home

(Robin Thicke)
All night long I wait 4 your lovin babe
All night long I wait 2 tear you 2 pieces
All night long I wait 4 your lovin babe
All night long I wait all night long
All night long I wait
2 see you naked
And watch the sunrise in your face
All night long I wait 4 you 2 play
And let my open arms take you away
