Song:

She puts on her work clothes, fishnet panty hose,
She’s got a nickname that everyone knows at the Gentlemen’s club
She clocks in at midnight, even though it never feels right,
Makes her money one dollar at a time.
Without the makeup, nobody knows her name,
She wears the pain

[Chorus:]
Black tears, rollin down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town
She reveals, they all cheer, then she cry’s,
Black tears

Jealous of the innocent, sometimes she’s convinced,
The boss man is still a friend she needs.
She’s tried everything, cheap s** and cocaine,
Anything to hide the pain for a little while
Wrong kind of famous in her momma’s eyes, you can tell she knows it when she cries,

[Chorus:]
Black tears, rolling down from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town,
White lights on the mirrors, just won’t hide,
Black tears

She tries and tries so hard to get away
But everybody’s watching,

[Chorus:]
Black tears, rollin down, from the eyes of an angel in a sinner’s town,
If all the pain could just disappear she'd quit cryin, she'd quit cryin,
Black tears
