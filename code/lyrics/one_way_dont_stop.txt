Song:

Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me

I love the things you do
My happiness comes from you
Don't ever stop doin' the things you do
'Cause I know, you know I love you

Don't stop ever lovin' me
(Don't stop [Incomprehensible] you do)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(I love lovin' you)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(No, no, no, no, no)
Don't stop ever lovin' me

You are the and the very last
You'll be my future and you're definitely my past
If you ever stop lovin' me I won't know where to turn
'Cause you're all of me
And you've reached the depth of my heart

(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(No, no, no don't stop)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(Lovin' me)
Don't stop ever lovin' me

It would make my life unbearable
If you ever stop lovin' me
So, stay with me forever
And our team will always be

(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me

(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
(With your love)
Don't stop ever lovin' me
