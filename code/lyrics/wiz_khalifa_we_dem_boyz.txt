[Hook X2]
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz

[Verse:]
Hol up, hol up, hol up, pop a bottle
Hol up, hol up, hol up, if you suck and swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin money on her like she won the lotto
P***y must be serious
Scared of heights come face your fears
Do it just like Nicki gon' and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner
Young n***a but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me s***
And white girls gimme becky
But first I gotta roll this joint, baby hol' up

[Hook:]
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz

[Verse 2:]
Hol up, hol up, hol up, you drive me crazy
Number 1, b***h you can't replace me
Leave the club these hoes be tryin to chase me
You got a a** so fat lets make a baby
Damn, I'm smokin weed in my mercedes
Hol up, these n****s broke, these n****s lazy
Man they money slim, they actin shady
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race
Ho, b***h you ain't call my phone so why you showin up
I'm takin them shots all my n****s stay loaded up
Man on the low all these hoes be actin so material
Hol up, man did you see her interior

[Hook:]
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, we dem boyz
Hol up, hol up, hol up, we makin' noise
Hol up, hol up, we dem boyz
