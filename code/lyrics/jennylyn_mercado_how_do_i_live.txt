(feat. Janno Gibbs)

How do I
Get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh I,
I need you in my arms need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything good in my life.

[Chorus:]
And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive,
How do I
How do I
Oh, how do I live without you?

Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There would be no world left for me and I,
Baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life.

[Chorus:]
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I wanna know
How do I breathe without you
If you'd ever go
How do I ever, ever survive,
How do I
Oh, how do I live... without you?

How do I live
How do I live

Oohh...
Oohh...
Oohh...

If you'd ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
Need you with me
Baby, don't you know that your everything (everything)
Good in my life (good in my life)

And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
I wanna know
How do I breathe without you
If you'd ever go
How do I ever, ever, survive
How do I
Oh, how do I live without you?
I wanna know
How do I breathe without you?
If you'd ever go
How do I ever, ever, survive
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
Oh, how do I live without you?

How do I live?
How do I live without you?
How do I live?
