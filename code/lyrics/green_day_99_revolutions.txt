Song:

There's a trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy

It's not one to 99, it's 99 to one
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight

There's a rat in the company
A bill on easy street
How the f**k did the working stiff
Become so obsolete?

Hit the lights and bang the drum
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the halls of justice and lost souls

It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And I'm 99 percent sure that something's wrong
It's all wrong

It's 99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight

99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight
99 revolutions tonight

9-9 to one
To one!
Yeahhh!
