ALL MY LIFE

Fernando Ortega - ALL MY LIFE
From the album - YOUR HOLINESS SURROUNDS ME
Label - Asaph (1994)

Let the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart
Be acceptable in Your sight, my Lord
Let the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart
Be acceptable, be acceptable

For You are my Rock, and You are my strength
You are my Redeemer
And I'll live for You 'cause You died for me
I need You to guide me all of my life

(Repeat above)

I need You all of my life
I need You all of my life
I need You all of my life
I need You all of my life
