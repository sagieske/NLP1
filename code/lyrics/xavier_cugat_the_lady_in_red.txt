Song:

The Lady In Red
Xavier Cugat

Say! Have you ever met the girl
Whos the toast of the town?
A work of art without a question,
Youd better write her number down.

Oh! The lady in red, the fellows are crazy
For the lady in red.
Shes a bit gaudy, but laudy,
What a personality.
Oh! The lady in red, is fresh as a daisy
When the town is in bed.
Dancing and dining and shining
With originally.
She is very proper.
Shes nothing more than a pal,
But oh me! And oh my! Youd never stop er,
Shed be a dangerous gal,
If she should ever meet the right guy.
Oh! The lady in red, the fellows are crazy
For the lady in red.
Is she a study, oh! Buddy
What a personality,
Shes got vitality.
