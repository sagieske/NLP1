Song:

If you ask me, why it took so long?
It was like waiting for that picture perfect song
If you ask me, why it took so many years?
It's never easy coping with your fears
If you ask me, how I felt being alone?
Where I was weak, God made me strong
If you ask me, if I really feel secure?
Before I say yes, I must be sure

(Sunny days) don't mean that it won't ever rain
(Money may) bring things but it won't erase the pain

Chorus
I love you, you love me
But we must be sure
We may be the best of friends
But in the end, it's true love that wins
Gotta be a love that will endure
I gotta be absolutely sure

If you ask me, what proceeds the wedding day?
It's the answers you receive when you pray
And if you find for any reason it's not pure
Before you say yes, you must be sure

(Sunny days) don't mean that it won't ever rain
(Money may) bring things but it won't erase the pain

Chorus

Bridge:
Could it be infatuation, or potential?
Losing a battle with temptation would never do
Though I'm not perfect, my objective is to be pure
So please forgive me for the wait
I had to be sure yeah (please understand)

Chorus:

Gotta be a love that will endure
Gotta be absolutely sure

If I'm gonna put my trust in you
Gotta be absolutely true

If I'm gonna share my life with you
Gotta be absolutely sure, yeah

Gotta be love that will endure
I Gotta be absolutley sure
