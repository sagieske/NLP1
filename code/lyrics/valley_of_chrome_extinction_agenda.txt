Song:

In a memory of a dying bond between adam and eve,
I raise my hands to forge a ritual.

Can it be possible to fall out of something sacred?
Why am I losing grip from everything I used to know?
The thick vines and thorns they wrap around my wrists.
It cuts me deep, the more I move the more I feel her pain.

Is this love or travesty?
Buried unto me?
Are we digging our own graves?
The more we close our eyes it remains.

The tears won't dry
Catch your breath, no second try.
Embrace your demise.

If I can control my heartbeat I will stop the blood from flowing.
So I can put my emotions to a halt.
I am human. I can feel the cold wind raping me in vain.
Hellbound, emptiness is found.

Is this love or travesty?
Buried unto me?
Are we digging our own graves?
The more we close our eyes it remains.

Embrace the moment. Freeze time's hands.
This can never be enough. My lips pale in comparison
To the diamons so rough.

As we face the days of war,
We know more of who we are.
As we watch the night descend,
This is our bitter end.

Let me drink from that chalice (tonight I will leave and burn)
Leave her to the heavens (I descend because) I have nowhere to turn.
For this sadness, the more impure my heart will be.
Unload me of this burden (the burden of deception)

Is this love or travesty?
Buried unto me?
Are we digging our own graves?
The more we close our eyes it remains.

The tears won't dry
Catch your breath, no second try.
Embrace your demise.

Is this love or my extinction?

The tears won't dry
Catch your breath, no second try.
Embrace your demise.
