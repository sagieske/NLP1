Song:

V1) I's jivin' in ma crib when the clock struck 8
I thought 'Hey Muzza Bruzzas I's a-gonna be late'
Even in my Ma's car dat school looks so far
I'd rather stay at home and play my guitar

V2) Hell, I went to school and I learnt some things
See, if ya go to school then the good life brings
You can see your homies, you can look at da girlz
And I know they love me cz I got all de curlz!

Ch) You take the M to the you to the double Zed Ay
I said" Hey Muzza lovers, gonna rock all day!"
You take the M to the you Zed Zed and Ay Eff
"We're gonna rock you Muzza Effers til ya all turn deaf!"

V3) Well I was down in town at the Boxing ring
Just a-duckin' and a -weavin' and a-takin' a swing
See, de sucker I was fightin' was a-6 feet 4
But with one flyin' Muzza punch he crashed to the floor

V4) Well a homy's gotta do what a homy's gotta do
People listen to the Muzza when I say what's true
You gotta stand your ground, you gotta be a man
You gotta do good to people every time you can

Ch) You take the M to the you to the double Zed Ay
I said" Hey Muzza lovers, gonna rock all day!"
You take the M to the you Zed Zed and Ay Eff
"We're gonna rock you Muzza Effers til ya all turn deaf!"
