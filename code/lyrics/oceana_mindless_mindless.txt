Song:

I'm staring at the cracks, and all the lines you wrote to get me home.
It's not over yet;
I'll speak the same until it breaks my jaw,
And it breaks my heart to see you this way.

So I'll pray for the day,
That new things will come to wash these ones away.

It's not over yet x3
It's not over at all.

I'm stairing at the cracks and all the lines you wrote to get me home.

So I'll pray for the day, that new things will come to wash these ones away.

There's something attractive in a lack of direction,
And you look so lost. And oh you look so lost. X2
And oh you look so lost. And oh you look so lost
