Yo, I'll tell you 'bout a drama
Of this wild girl, for real
She was wilder than most of them street cats, for real
The black Pamela Anderson, Barb Wire or similar
Crisp, like a gold plated dessert eagle she dealt with ya
Sky's the limit, a lady thug underneath
Watch all the huslters givin' nuff respect to Shanice
Had mad connects, but half of them would have to risk life
To make a million was the biggest goal on her rife
She just engraved it, small, right on the outside of the barrell
Couldn't really notice it unless you looked close like choaclate goes
Right by the light post
She juggled on the corner with a blown barb
Bleed you through nights, a couple slugs
Dark blocks always run hot, heat up your spot
Anything done, comes with consequence, sometimes suspend shot
Forever guide you as long you stay strong
The real girl relate to these words, the last don

[Chorus:]
'round and 'round it goes, but I still strive
I'm human, I'm human
The dollar sign is what controlled her life
But never mistaken

Yo, you wanna hear about Shanice
She livin' in this cold world
Walks with a shotty, response for nobody
Streetwise, on a street level they try to take yours
Try to run your mouth with these ops between your jaws
She knows how to draw cocked hammers and four fours
Must've ride in under her lingere in the top drawer
Sometimes she feels she gotta rock a vest
For the types of work she's invovled wit'
Rob all your goods, make you strip
One night, a bachelor got locked off in the west
Ah yeah, they done it too fast, the house under heard a gun blast
A wild wannabe be one, right through the ceiling
Now everybody gotta leave, house is fogged up from trees
Shanice is on her way out, she bucked a girl she had drama wit'
Back then once, but never seen since
She's in the eyes of others, but too vexed to hear her told
Me be in this last verse, and watch this drama unfold

[Chorus:]

She was a girl who didn't hesitate to deal with your case
The other girl, her man was drapin' it, and all in her face
Didn't love the drama, but dealt wit it when came to it
Like the flame fluid in a lighter, same to it
Half drunk, her man grabbed Shanice by the arm
She made a quick dip, down in her kicks she kept her ops
Tight right beside her ankle braclet
She pulled it out and beat a pair grains
Whoever stood around, she put you involved
The girl, she picked up one inside her abdomin
Her man picked up one inside the arm for trying to hold on
Same time she fled the scenery, on the way out
She dropped her little ankle braclet, but she figured it out
Only until she got home, she seen it gone, knew the risk
Turn on the tv, city news lookin' for clues
But months later, the time dragged on and caught up
It's comin' back around like three sixty, but born shifty
Twice hard, you either get turned or get time
Some stellos get to turn you quick and instant, no fines
Somebody knocked the door a couple light times out in the cold
She didn't see nobody standin' outside through the peephole
That's where she made a wrong move and opened up the door
Kid jumped up, from behind the wall, holdin' a big four
Bare face, didn't have a mask
That's why she recognized him from the past, kid started to blast
Blew one for the incident
Two in her neck back
Three for his cousin that she killed a couple months back
She titled then collapsed and find her sleepin' in the doorway
Floodin' the hallway, what goes around will come to the long way
