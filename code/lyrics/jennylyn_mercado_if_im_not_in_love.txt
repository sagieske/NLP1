Song:

[Jennylyn]:
If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through, tonight
And if this heart is lying then
What should I believe in
Why do I go crazy
Everytime I think about you baby
Why else do I want you like I do
If I'm not in love with you, with you

[Janno]:
And if I don't need your touch
Why do I miss you so much, tonight
If it's just infatuation
Why is my heart aching
To hold you forever
[Jennylyn]: to hold you forever
[Both]: Give a part of me I thought I'd never
[Janno]: Give again to someone I could lose
[Both]: If I'm not in love with you


[Both]:
Oh why in every fantasy
Do I feel your arms embracing me
[Jennylyn]: Like lovers lost in sweet desire
[Janno]: someone take...
[Jennylyn]: And why in dreams do I surrender
[Both]: Like a little baby
[Jennylyn]: How do I explain this feeling
[Both]: Someone tell me


[Janno]:
If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through.. tonight
[Jennylyn]: And if this heart is lying then
[Janno]: and if this heart is lying then..
[Jennylyn]: What should I believe in
[Janno]: oohh..
[Jennylyn]: Why do I go crazy
[Janno]: why do i go crazy
[Both]:
Every time I think about you baby
Why else do I want you like I do..
[Janno]: if im not in love ahhh..
[Jen]: if im not in love
[Janno]: if im not in love with..
[Both]: if im not in love with you..
