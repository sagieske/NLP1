Song:

The rain may be falling and lightning fills the sky
But the sun is rising
God is on my side
The wind may blow around me and thunder may go boom
The clouds are disappearing
Your light is shining through
Never give up ‘cause He's always there
Never give up anytime, anywhere
Never give up ‘cause He's always there
Remember God is always by your side.
