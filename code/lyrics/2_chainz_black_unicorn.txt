[Intro: Sunni Patterson]
And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Of something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod
I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said that "The best thing you can do and be is you
This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due"
Ain't that the truth
And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah!
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas s**t
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucet
Drip, f**k the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a n***a younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that b***h like I'm selling coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade

[Hook:]
[?] is all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practised rapping [?] I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze
Dad kept this in the dungarees, I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got [?]
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them [?] jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this, underscore, it's just me and [?]
Dirty a** n****s, we'll sell your a** a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me

[Hook:]
