Song:

Picture a man with no reason for living
With no hope of smiling again
Imagine a world with no golden daybreak
Enclosed by the blackness of sin

And the sea is bathed in beauty and glory
Transformed by love's sweet embrace
The hands of the Savior, erased all my sorrow
And painted this picture of grace

How skillful the hands of the artist
Who painted this picture of me
He saw with the eyes of a master
How beautiful my life could be

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair
This masterpiece hangs in it's place
It's signed with his blood and it's framed with his glory
This beautiful picture of grace

The ashes and ruin
That once filled the picture
Had vanished and faded from view
And beautiful touches of mercy adorned
This picture he painted anew

Such peace filled the eyes of the man he created
A smile gently rests on his face
Since Jesus erased all the guilt of my past
And painted this picture of grace

How skillful the hands of the artist
Who painted this picture of me
He saw with the eye's of a master
How beautiful my life could be

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair
This masterpiece hangs in it's place
It's signed with his blood and it's framed with his glory
This beautiful picture of grace

Where once was a portrait of gloom and despair
This masterpiece hangs in it's place
It's signed with his blood and it's framed with his glory
This beautiful picture of grace
This beautiful picture of grace
