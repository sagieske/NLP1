Song:

You see me on tv
Different videos
I've got a new chick every week I know
Don't use that to judge me
Come and get to kno me
Hopefully I can show you just what I'm all about.

[Bridge:]
(you never know)
What you might be missin'
(gimme a go)
Yes I'll beat your interest
(this is a show)
You wont be dissapointed heres your invatation come on (right now)

[Chorus:]
Have you ever been with a star everywhere you go everybody knows ya
Have you ever been with a star
24/7 red carpet,
Have you ever been a star
Its obvious to see where you should be, with me have you ever been with a star

I bet you never thought I'd wash my own dishes
Ill take out the trash girl you know I'm getin
I know ur asumin that it's just a song
Only chasin groupies you couldn't be ma wrong.

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]

There's only so much I can say
To persuade you my way
(oh girl) girl you need to trust in me
Forget about what you heard
Baby ima show you what I'm all about (baby)

[Chorus:]

Have you ever been with a star
Have you ever been with a star
Have you ever been with a star
Its obvious to see..
