Song:

There are times
When I'm lyin' in my bed
How I pellow and cry from this stupid get
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-out, swelling
As I keep on
Diggin' my face
In these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered, I am

Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me in drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine
For all eternity
Now this angel has flown away from me
I thought I had the strength to set her free
I did what I did
Because I love her so
Will she ever find her way
Back home to me

I'm so tired
I feel like catching forty-winks
Being up all night in this elbow-room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make
Still I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time
Oh, heaven knows how embittered, I am

Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me in drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine
For all eternity
Now this angel has flown away from me
I thought I had the strength to set her free
I did what I did
Because I love her so
Will she ever find her way
Back home to me
