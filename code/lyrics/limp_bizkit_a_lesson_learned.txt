Song:

This pain, this pain
In my stomach, won't go away
I assume, this is punishment
From all the mistakes, I've made

In a world, where my actions speak louder than words
In a world, where my actions speak louder than words

I know more people than ever before
One lesson, I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cuz I'm lonelier now, than I've ever been

'Cuz this pain in my stomach, won't go away
I assume, this is punishment
For the mistakes, I've made

In a world, where my actions speak louder than words
In a world, where my actions speak louder than words

I know more people than ever before
One lesson, I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cuz I'm lonelier now, than I've ever been
