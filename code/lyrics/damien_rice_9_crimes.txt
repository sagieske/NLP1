Lisa: Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I've got no excuse

Lisa: Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright with you?
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright with you?
With you...

Damien: Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you
It's the wrong time
She's pulling me through
It's a small crime
And I've got no excuse

Damien: Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.)when it's loaded
Is that alright with you?
If you don't shoot it how (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.) am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.) when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?

Damien: Is that alright, yeah?
Give my gun away (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.) when it's loaded
Is that alright with you?
If you don't shoot it how (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.) am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright with you?
Give my gun away (Lisa: Is that alright? Yeah.) when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?

(Slight Overlap..)
Damien: Is that alright, yeah?
Lisa: Give my gun away when it's loaded
Damien: Is that alright, yeah?
Lisa: If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Damien: Is that alright, yeah?
Lisa: Give my gun away when it's loaded
Damien: Is that alright, is that alright?

D & L: Is that alright with you?

Damien: No...
