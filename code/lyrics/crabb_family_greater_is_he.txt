Song:

I took the challenge when I said that I would stand
I knew it wouldn't be an easy thing cause it messed up Satan's plan
God gives me daily strength to stand in victory
Though the powers of Hell may come my way
Greater is He in me

Chorus:
Greater, Greater, Greater is He in me.
I'm singing, I'm shouting, I'm happy and I'm free.
I'm a soldier in an army that never has known defeat.
Greater, Greater, Greater is He in me.

Verse ii:
For so long I wondered in this cold, cruel world alone.
Heartbreak and much failure was just about all I'd ever known.
Then I met God's only Son who listened to my plea.
Now life has a brand new chapter,
Greater is He in me.
