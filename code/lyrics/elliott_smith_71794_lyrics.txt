Song:

They come here alone and they leave in twos
Except for you and me who just come to use if
You're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doin' hangin' out with me?
Why do you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue?
If you'll be straight with me, I'll be straighter with you
And if you're all done like you said you'd been
What are you doin' hangin' out with me?
I haven't wanted to do anything for a long time
But whatever you got right
Now, would probably suit me fine
And if you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doin' hangin' out with me?
I haven't wanted to do anything for a long time
But whatever you're doin' now
Would probably suit me fine
And if you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doin' hangin' out with me?
What are you doin' hangin' out with me?
