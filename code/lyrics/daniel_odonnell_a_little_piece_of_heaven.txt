Song:

I've been thinkin' about you
Twenty-four hours a day
When I'm sleepin' in my bed
You just won't go away.

You're doin' something' to me girl
With that warm, sweet smile
I've never felt like this before
But oh, it feels so fine.

Well, you're a little piece of heaven
You my angel
You're all I've ever wanted
You're so perfect in my arms.

And I'd go to hell and back for you
Die for you if you ask me too
You're a little piece of heaven
You're an angel in my heart.

--- Instrumental ---

Well, I'm goin' down to the jewelry store
To buy me a golden band
And I'm gettin' down upon one knee
To ask you for your hand.

And I can hear those weddin' bells
Ringin' in my ears
And I can see us both together
Through our sunset years.

Well, you're a little piece of heaven
You my angel
You're all I've ever wanted
You're so perfect in my arms.

And I'd go to hell and back for you
Die for you if you ask me too
You're a little piece of heaven
You're an angel in my heart.

You're a little piece of heaven
You're an angel in my heart...
