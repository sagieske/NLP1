Song:

Somewhere between faith and prayer
There are hopes and dreams
Still unopened
But I know You are waiting there
To give me more than I could imagine
All You want is all my trust
And all I want is all Your love
Chorus:
You say knock and it will open
You say ask and you'll receive
You say seek and I will find
All the blessings You have in store for me
It's so hard to understand
How a simple prayer
Cried out to heaven
Will change the world I'm livin' in
And touch the hearts of those around me
Lord I know when I seek Your will
And I'm willing to believe Your words
When I know it will open
When I ask I will recieve
When I seek You I will find
All the blessings You have in store for me
