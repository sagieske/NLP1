Song:

You said you love me
Is that a matter of fact, fact, fact...

I guess I fell for it
Almost believed in it
I let my heart rule my head

You really got to me
Your sensuality
But pleasure ain't my only need

You thought you'd pull the wool over the little lamb's eye
(Do you think I'd be that blind)
I was spellbound hypnotized, but don't you patronize

You said you love me
Oh I was so blind
You had my world spinning round and round
You said you need me
Is that a matter of fact
Oh everybody's talking behind my back
You said I was your heart and soul desire
There ain't no smoke
Without fire

An educated guess
Tells me you're faithless
Lie through your teeth, but your eyes confess

You got no dignity
You ain't no good for me
So save your tears and get off your knees

You thought you'd pull the wool over the little lamb's eye
(Do you think I'd be that blind)
I was spellbound hypnotized, but don't you patronize

You said you love me
Oh I was so blind
You had my world spinning round and round
You said you need me
Is that a matter of fact
Oh everybody's talking behind my back
You said I was your heart and soul desire
There ain't no smoke

Without fire...
Oh you said you love me
Yeah yeah, I was so blind
There ain't no smoke without fire

You thought you'd pull the wool over the little lamb's eye
I was spellbound hypnotized, oh oh

You said you love me
Oh I was so blind
You had my world spinning round and round
You said you need me
Is that a matter of fact
Oh everybody's talking behind my back
Oh you said I was your heart and soul desire
There ain't no smoke
Without fire

You said you love me
Oh I was so blind
You had my world spinning round and round
You said you need me
Is that a matter of fact
Oh everybody's talking behind my back
You said I was your heart and soul desire
There ain't no smoke
Without fire
