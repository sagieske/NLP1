Song:

[Verse:]
You never wanted to believe that we’d ever disagree
Beneath the dream, now it’s cold as ever
I always wanted to deny
That the ocean is the sky
Like you tonight
It’s been that way forever

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yea, we always hurt the ones we love
We hurt the ones we love
We love, we love
But it doesn’t mean that you and I should be alone tonight
Should be alone tonight, tonight, tonight

(Chorus – part 1)
Save the last goodbye for me
One more shiny memory
Always remember
I’ll leave the light on for you, for you, for you

(Chorus – part 2)
Save the last goodbye for me
Wake me up before you leave
Always remember
I’ll leave the light on for you, for you, for you, for you

[Verse:]
We burned so bright before the fall
Engines slowing to a crawl
We had it all
So why are we waiting?
‘Cause even though it’s hard to hold
No, we just can’t let it go
Away, so stay
Keep this light from fading

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yea, we always hurt the ones we love
We hurt the ones we love
We love, we love
But it doesn’t mean that you and I should be alone tonight
Should be alone tonight, tonight, tonight

(Chorus – part 1)
Save the last goodbye for me
One more shiny memory
Always remember
I’ll leave the light on for you, for you, for you

(Chorus – part 2)
Save the last goodbye for me
Wake me up before you leave
Always remember
I’ll leave the light on for you, for you, for you, for you

[Bridge:]
Save the last goodbye
Save the last goodbye
Save the last goodbye
The last goodbye, the last goodbye

You and I can make it through tonight
Make it through tonight, tonight, tonight

(Chorus – part 2)
Save the last goodbye for me
Wake me up before you leave
Always remember
I’ll leave the light on for you, for you, for you, for you

You and I can make it through tonight
Make it through tonight, tonight, tonight
