Lyrics: Charles Hart

No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me
Every waking moment,
Turn my head
With talk of summertime.

Say you need me
With you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light
You're safe, no-one will find you
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night:
And you always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me
One love, one life-time;
Let me lead you from your solitude.

Say you need me with you,
Here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too.
Christine, that's all I ask of you.

Say you'll share with me
One love, one life-time;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.
Say you love me!
You know I do.
Love me, that's all I ask of you.

Anywhere you go, let me go too;
