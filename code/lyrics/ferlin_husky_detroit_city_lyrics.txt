Song:

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about the cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home
Now homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars and at night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home
I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find that I've just been wastin' my time
So I think I'll take my foolish pride get on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones all the loved ones that I left waiting so far behind
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh Lord I wanna go home
Oh Lord I wanna go home
