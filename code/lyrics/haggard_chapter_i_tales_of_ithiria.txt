Song:

Quando coeli movendi sunt et terra

Quando coeli movendi sunt et terra
Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem

My son, now listen what I say:
Keep in mind what you have learned
Wrap your fingers 'round your sword
Maybe you will not return
Thousands that we once have been
Only a few are still here
I've to give this sacrifice...

... Oh, the autumn brought us fear!

My life, my blood, my tears, my pain
I'm the guardener of thee
Through an axestrike I have lost
The ability to see
Now my child, your time hath come
Mercy - not with those you'll harm
Wrap your fingers 'round your sword...

(And the ones we love will fall
Like autumn leaves
On these endless fields)

... As the horn sounds the alarm!
Und als der Sturm begann
Als Fleisch auf Eisen traf
Hell wie der Glocken Klang
Die Schreie derer, deren Glьck versagt

Mit Wunden ьbersдt
Der Eichenhain ihm Schutze bot
Wie die Legende sagt
War dies des Vaters sich'rer Tod

Now that all silence was disturbed
The Ground, as red as autumn leafs
Father Frost, the last they feel
On these mighty, endless fields

Quando coeli movendi sunt et terra
Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem

Hush hush, my child
Mother death is your bride
If you listen her song you will follow
So better beware
Let your senses take care
Your innocent mind will be hallowed

A step in the dark
(Miserere Dominus)
A secret to hide
(Rex tremendae majestatis)
A legend to tell
(Libera eas)
Drowned in the waters of time
(Miserere Dominus)

A secret to hide

He holds
Wisdom of ancient times
A parchment with numbers and rhymes
Fear speaks the spell to survive
The circle of druids - alive!

They all gathered in the night
Within the torches light
As their slumber did awake

So I did wish a thousand times
Mother Death would come to me
In her arms I will entwine
And I'm rising up to thee
Now my child, my time hath come
Mercy - not with those I'll harm
I wrap my fingers 'round my sword...

... As their horn sounds the alarm!

Now the winter begins
On this endless fields
