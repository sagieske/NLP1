Song:

Yes, I'm your angel,
Ill give you evrything
In my magic power.
So make a wish and Ill let it come true for you.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

Youre my fairy,
You give me evrything
I ever wanted from life.
Have I made a wish and is that why I have you?
Tra-la-la-la-la.

We believe in pumpkins that turn into princesses
And frogs that turn into princes.
We believe in the moons that smile on us
When we hurry home before the midnight strikes.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

Yes, I'm so pretty,
Youre so dizzy
And were so happy evry day.
Lets make a wish and let it come true for us.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

I'm in your pocket,
Youre in my locket
And were so lucky in evry way.
We make a wish and let it come true for us.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

We believe in houses built in the sky,
And love that lift us high.
We believe in the sun that looks over our shoulder
And brings our shadows together.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

Yes, our hearts are one,
Our bodies, too
And its so good, mm, evrytime.
We make a wish and let it come true for you, too.
Tra-la-la-la-la.

Happy birthday, my love,
I'm your angel,
Ill give you evrything in my magic power.
So make a wish and Ill let it come true for you.
Tra-la-la-la-la-la.
