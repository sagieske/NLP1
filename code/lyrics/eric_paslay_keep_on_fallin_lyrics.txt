Song:

Hey there baby, what do you say?
There's a look in your eyes, lookin' my way
Castin' your stare my way all night
Got a crazy idea I think you'd like

Hey sweet sugar, in the sexy boots
How 'bout a drive down the avenue
Thinkin' about a new tattoo
I'd love to see my name in ink on you
Let's go

Chorus:
Rockin' 'til the sun comes up
Talkin' forever ain't enough
Fallin' in the moonlight love
Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up, yeah

Oh, I got a real fast jet black Pontiac
Enough cash in a suitcase to never come back
Been thinkin' 'bout flying down to paradise
It won't be the same if you're not by my side

Repeat Chorus

Oh, yeah

Keep on fallin' 'til you just let go
Keep on fallin', baby, here we go

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) when the sun comes up
(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) when the sun comes up
(Keep on fallin' when the sun comes up) c'mon, c'mon baby, baby
(Keep on fallin') when the sun comes up, yeah
