Song:

What to say Lord it's You Who gave me life
And I can't explain
Just how Much You mean to me
Now that You have saved me Lord
I give all that I am to You
That everday I will
Be a light that shines Your name

(Verse 2 and 3)
Everyday Lord I'll learn to stand upon Your Word
And I pray that I, that I might
Come to know You more
You will guide me in
Every single step I take and
Everyday I will be a light unto the world

[Chorus:]
Everyday it's You I live for
Everyday I'll follow after You
Everyday I'll walk with You my Lord

[Bridge:]
It's You I live for everyday
It's You I live for everyday
It's You I live for everyday
