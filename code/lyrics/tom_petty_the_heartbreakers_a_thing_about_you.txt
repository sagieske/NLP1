Song:

I'm not much on mystery
Yeah, you gotta be careful
What you dream
I thought this might pass with time
Yeah, I thought I was satisfied

{Chorus}:
But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I got a thing about you

Somewhere deep in the
Middle of the night
Lovers hold each other tight
Whisper in their anxious ears
Words of love that disappear

{Chorus}

Baby, you own
Some strange control over me
Yeah, it's so wild
It hypnotizes me

Raise both hands

{Chorus}
