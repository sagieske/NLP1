Song:

Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Abused, confused
Everyday you feel every crime just stare up at the space and wonder why (why)
Afraid, deranged

Hold on to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell among us

Everyday you get a little bit older and everything gets hard you wonder why (why)
Afraid, deranged
Everyday you feel every crime an endless shocking show on the parade
Abused, confused

Hold on to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams are trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell among us

Everyday convince myself of everything I can and can't believe
Afraid, deranged

Hold on to your promise you can use it for a crutch
Stand by while all your dreams get trampled in the dust
Leave now before your slick machines begin to rust
Last chance farewell among us

Among us

We're the aliens
We're the aliens
We're the aliens
We're the aliens
We're the aliens
