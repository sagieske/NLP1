Song:

I believed in fairy tales
In magic spells and wishing wells
And pirate sails
And once I thought I'd never fall in love
That shows how much I knew
I believed in Superman
In Santa Claus, the world of Oz
And wonderland
But one by one those fantasies have failed
While you keep shining through
I still believe in you

I could never doubt your kiss
No other love
Fills me like this
If you take a chance, you'll see
I believe in you
Believe in me

Other dreams may turn to dust
But I don't care
If you'll be there
I'll always trust
'Cause I believe with all my heart and soul
This dream we share is true
I still believe in you
