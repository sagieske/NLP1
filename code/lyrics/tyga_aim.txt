Song:

She' don't know my name
She just know me by my aim (aim aim) [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Aim tyga man again
Got a little message for my instant friends
Be back in a mintue on vacation
Away from them haters hating on him
Introducing the musician
Gotta be more then a 4 to impress him
Punch in my pin
And begin the chatting
Ichat the best mac book I'm a mac yes
Getting every dollar G. E. D dymes
Captial charge I did the crime
Can't take the heat don't feel the fire
She difficult to reach but I'm harder to find cause

[Chorus:]
She don't know me by my name
She just know me by my aim
My song on her page on myspace
Never seen her face
She send messages

[Verse 2:]
Replenish my sins repeat then repin

Magic magician what the games been missing
Rap is favorite swagg and she diggs
This is turning into a daily thing
Comma routine baby how you doing?
Alright hows your music

Phone on silent no time for drama
Too busy bottle poppin

Recording my oasis only
Always on point like ginolle
