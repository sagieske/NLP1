Living inside myself I -- Didn't need no one else
I was alright Yeah -- Alright Yeah
Every night was lonely -- And nobody ever told me
Look inside -- Look inside
I was blind and I couldn't see that was right in front of me
You could tell that I lived in a shadow
Locked away in my darkness and pain
And my heart was shut down and in prison
You were sent here to free it again
And the moment I almost went under
You came through cause I almost said goodbye
Shattered and broke down I -- Was hopin to turn it round
There's no way -- There's no way
I couldn't find a reason -- When there's nothing to believe in
Anyway -- Anyway
I was blind and I couldn't see what was right in front of me
I been contemplating -- Been so down I wanna die
Almost said goodbye
And in the end I -- Hope I find a friend who's
Just like you -- Just like you
Happiness surrounds you
Now that I finally found me too -- Me and you
