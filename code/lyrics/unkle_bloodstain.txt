Song:

Alice temple:

They say if you took it all away
This love would fall apart
I say, no way
You don't know the size of my heart.

Vicious, suspicious
It doesnt't't matter what I say
Users and losers
There's nothing here to make me stay.

Bloodstain on a blue vein
Take it with no shame
Love tracks on a loose train
Bloodstain

No gain with no pain
My scars are deeper than you think
Tie me, try me
One more time before I sink.

Big lies, big times
This love is not what were about
Its too late, and I'm too straight
Its time to blow this fire out.

Bloodstain on a blue vein
Take it with no shame
Love tracks on a loose train
Bloodstain on a blue vein

Take me softly
I'm going crazy for your touch.

Bloodstain on a blue vein
(blue.... Blood, blue.... Blood, blue... Blood)
Take it with no shame
(no... Take, no... Take, no... Take)

Be be k roche sample:
I'm alone
And dissatisfied
And someone else is alone
And dissatisfied

Blade runner sample:
You are alone?
