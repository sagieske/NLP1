Song:

10 Years (Oprah Winfrey show 10 year anniversary theme)


You are moving on a crowded street
Through various shades of people
In the summers harshest heat
A story in your eye
Well, speak until your minds at ease

Ten years come and gone so fast
I might as well be dreaming
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season
A fortune rises to the sky
Ten years come and gone so fast

You are driving down an empty road
Beside a shady river
When the sky turns dark as stone
The trees begin to shiver
The grace of God is nigh

Ten years come and gone
And that flash has never been forgotten
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season
How do the powerless survive
Ten years come and gone so fast

And if you look into your future life
Ten years from this question
Do you imagine a familiar light
Burning in the distance
The love that never died

Ten years come and gone so fast
I might as well be dreaming
Sunny days have burned a path
Across another season

Ten years come and gone so fast
Sunny days have burned a path
