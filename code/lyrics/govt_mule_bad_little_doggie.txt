Song:

Bigelow the gigolo had no where else to go
His sad eyes had seen it all
Scarred and lonely, tough as nails
Open your heart when all else fails
Wear the veil and the trojan horse smile
Looking back on yesteryear
Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling
But hindsight is very clear when loneliness is falling
And you have fallen down, down from the heavens
Stuck out in the desert
Amazing grace - such a lonely place
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
To carry you away
Target practice with other peoples lives
Hit a few right between the eyes
But, most of the time, you were wounded by the ricochet
You say play to win, boys, never play to lose
Long as your playing, boy, you're bullet-proof
But think about it - you're bleeding to death anyway
And you have fallen down, down from the heavens
Stuck out in the desert
Amazing grace - such a lonely place
For heroes like you and me
Fallen down, just like a shooting star
With no fallen angel standing by
Angel of mercy, take pity on a fool
That spent a lifetime wondering
What Napoleon would do
If he were in your shoes
Rich, without pleasure - respected without love
Drinking poison from a golden cup
While anger, brother of fear, creeps like a knife into your heart
Looking back on yesteryear
Seems like, maybe, you missed your calling
But hindsight is very clear when loneliness is falling
And destinys through calling
And you have fallen down - fallen down
Amazing grace - it's such a lonely place
Oh yes it is
Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen down
Fallen d
