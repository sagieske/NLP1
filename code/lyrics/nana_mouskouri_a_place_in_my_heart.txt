Song:

(J. P. Ferland / Shaper)

1-

I got your letter yesterday

From some small town I never knew

It told me you were on your way

But not where you were going to

2-

You said you're following the sun

But do you really know for sure

For after all is said and done

Just what it is you' re looking for

3-

There' s a place in my heart

I wish that your eyes could see

And there' s no one on earth

Who loves you as much as me

4-

If you just travel on and on

Till I don't know where

There's a place in my heart

You may never find again

5-

And so you travel with the wind

You' ll find some road to fly along

And though your letter says the word

Your heart may soon forget the song

6-

Then you may someday write the poem

That tells your life in words of fire

But you will never have a home

Or find the love that you desire

(Repeat 3-4-)

7-

And so heading for the sea

Now that the flowers are in bloom

Just when the wild mimosa tree

Is like the colour of our room

(Repeat 4)
