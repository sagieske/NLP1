Song:

Baby, oh baby, tell the man at the ticket stand
That you've changed your mind
Well, let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flying
'Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind

Break my mind, break my mind.
Well. I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break my mind, break my mind, oh lord
If you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind.

Baby, oh baby, well, let me take your suitcase off of that scale in time
Just tell the man that you suddenly developed a thing about high flying
'Cause if you say goodbye to me you know you're gonna break my mind
Well, if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind.

Well, if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind...
