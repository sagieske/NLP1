Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
Baby let's rap now
I wanna talk to you
Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
It's important to me
It's so important to me.

Dancing is fine
But it's not on my mind
No not tonight
I wanna get closer to you baby
Oh baby mentality.

Come on let's make it happen
Girl let it be
I want to reveal
What it is I feel
About you baby
Oh about you baby.

Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
Baby let's rap now
I wanna talk to you
Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
It's important to me
It's so important to me.

What you been saving
I been wanting
For a long, long time
This is the real deal
This is how I feel
About you baby
Oh about you baby.

Ain't nothing like good, good lovin'
Oh baby when it's done right
Let's put our love minds together
It will be more then precious.

Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
Baby let's rap now
I wanna talk to you
Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
It's important to me
It's so important to me.

Let's sit down
And talk this over
You and I get along just fine
What you been saving
I been wanting
Oh for such a long time.

Baby let's rap now
Dance a little later
Baby let's rap now
I wanna talk to you.
