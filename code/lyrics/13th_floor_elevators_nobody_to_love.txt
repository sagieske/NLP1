Song:

In her eyes they reflect a smile
Cascading to the shore, 
And then her words like golden birds
Would love to follow the storm.

And then her voice was echoing
Through the night no more, 
And I remember all the dreams, 
And all the words before.

She knew the sun was shining, 
She knew the moon was shining, 
She knew her eyes were finding mine.

She knew the sun would come
And it would shine for us all day.
Burning bright it's morning light
Would flood us with the day.

Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to love, 
Nobody to

Now I face the midnight
With nobody to love.
I used to leave at twilight
With nobody to love.

She left me in the wilderness, all I had was hope, 
She left me only loneliness, each day so cold, 
And now I have no one to hold.

She knew the sun would come
And it would shine for us all day, 
Burning bright it's morning light
Would flood us with the day.
