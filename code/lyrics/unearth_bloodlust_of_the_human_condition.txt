Song:

We feed this hunger for horror
Cold is the human heart, is the human mind
All born with sickness and impurity
Bloodlust of the human condition

Dark fears are wanted
Spread it so these eyes can capture doom
Thirst for destruction
Will feed this firestorm until we're gone

I can no longer close my eyes
This is our mortality
Taken away is our hope
Clip our wings; crush our dreams
This is a part of us all
Clip our wings; crush our dreams
Forever a part of us all

We feed on horror
Sold is the human soul for crimes in nature
It's our bloodlust condition

Dark fears are wanted
Spread it o these eyes can capture doom
Thirst for destruction
Will feed this firestorm until we're gone

We feed on horror
We're drawn into these open wounds
The crowds all gather to feed their bloodlust
