PHANTOM'S VOICE: Brava, brava, bravissima . . .

MEG:
Christine, Christine...
(Phantom: Christine...)

Where in the world
Have you been hiding?
Really, you were perfect!

I only wish
I knew your secret!
Who is your great tutor?

CHRISTINE:
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here

Here in this room
He calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding

Somehow I know
He's always with me
He - the unseen genius

MEG:
Christine, you must have been dreaming, stories like this can't come true

Christine, you're talking in riddles, and it's not like you!

CHRISTINE:
Angel of Music!
Guide and guardian!
Grant to me your glory!

MEG(to herself):
Who is this angel? This...

BOTH:
Angel of Music!
Hide no longer!
Secret and strange angel

CHRISTINE:
He's with me, even now...

MEG:
Your hands are cold...

CHRISTINE:
All around me...

MEG:
Your face, Christine, it's white...

CHRISTINE:
It frightens me...

MEG:
Don't be frightened...
