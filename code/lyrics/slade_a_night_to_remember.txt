Song:

Oh, I know, if you're ready for me, my hot rod's ready to burn
An' I know, if you're waitin' for me, my engine's startin' to turn
I've bin livin' on Platform Nine, travellin' thru'
I've bin savin' my skin machine for you

Chorus
Look out ... tonight ... a-will be ... a night to remember
Look out ... a-tonight ... is a-gonna be ... a night to remember
Look out, yeah ... look out, yeah

I know, if you're revvin' it up, my radiator will boil
An' I know, if you get into gear, you need a better quality oil
I've bin livin' on borrowed time, well overdue
I've been savin' it all alone for you

Chorus
Look out ... tonight ... a-will be ... a night to remember
Look out ... 'cos tonight's ... gonna be ... a night to remember
Look out, yeah ... look out, look out

Oh, I know, if you're ready for me, my engine's ready to burn, burn, burn
I know, if you're ready for me, my hot rod's ready to turn

Chorus
Look out ... tonight ... is gonna be ... a night to remember
Look out ... a-tonight ... is gonna be ... a night to remember
Look out, yeah ... for me, a night to remember
... a night to remember, look out, yeah ... look out, yeah
