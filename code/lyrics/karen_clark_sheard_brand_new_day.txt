Song:

"Brand New Day" by Karen Clark Sheard featuring Yolanda Adams

Yolanda:
You may have done
Some things that you're not
Too proud of, at one point in your life
Well, you're just one good prayer away
From living again
Starting today

Chorus:
It's a brand new day
Spread the news, go tell a friend
It's alright to love, it's okay to live again
Never mind your faults
What you've done or
Where you've been
It's what's in your heart
It's all that matters in the end
It's a brand new day

Karen:
Maybe you were involved
In a love gone bad before
And ever since then
You've been bitter and scorn
All those bad feelings
You no longer need to hold
'Cause we're in with the new
Out with the old

Chorus:

Yolanda:
Things that made you angry in your past
Karen:
Now you look at them, and you can laugh
Yolanda:
Cause they don't
And they won't
Karen
Matter anymore

Chorus
[repeat]
