Song:

[Verse: Elliphant)
Come on now sugar, come
I really don't wanna go home
Stay with me, be a friend
These streets so cold
And our money's full of goals
Come up now, take your car
I own a cc bar
Not far downtown, you get taccos for free
And it's open all night, come on hang with me

[Pre-Chorus:]
I got money, I got money
(I play for you, I play for you)
I got money, I got money
(I play for you, you play for me)

[Chorus:]
Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Stay with me alright
Let us bring it all back to life
(Don't fade away) Stay!

[Verse 2: Elliphant & MÃ˜)
I like it here, f**k work
Plus, you said your boss is a jerk
I need you now, don't bail on me
I'mma break, you see, let's do what we
Always used to do
Stupid round like two fools
Nights alone, I'm feel alone
You look after me, it hurts, oh

[Pre-Chorus:]
I got money, I got money
(I play for you, I play for you)
I got money, I got money
(I play for you, you play for me)

[Chorus:]
Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Stay with me alright
Let us bring it all back to life
Don't fade away, stay!

[Bridge:]
One more, come on
It's not a big deal
One more (one more, girl)
On me (come on), let we go on
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)
One more (one more), on me (come on)
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)
One more (one more), on me (on me)
Let we go on (and we go on)
It's not a big deal (it's not a big deal)

[Chorus:]
Stay with me tonight
We can count the street lights
Stay with me alright
Let us bring it all back to life
Don't fade away, stay!
