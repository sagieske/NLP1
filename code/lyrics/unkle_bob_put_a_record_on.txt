Song:

I put a record on
Put it on and sing along with you
Sing along with you
And that's okay by me
That's okay 'cause in a way I'm free
In a way I am free

And you don't have to sympathize
I will try and dry my eyes

And I'm okay if we're drinking
Grab a beer and disappear with me
Disappear with me
And you don't, you don't have to sympathize
I will try and dry my eyes

And I put a record on
Put it on and get it on with you
Get it on with you

This time you'll find some other gonna mess your mind
It's too late or too soon
Some other gonna come too soon

Put it on
I will try and dry my eyes
Put it on
Am I something you despise?
Put it on
I will try to dry my eyes

I put a record on
I put a record on
I put a record on
Too soon

Put it on
And I will try and dry my eyes
Put it on
But am I something you despise?
Put it on
I will try to dry my eyes, my love
