Song:

If you believe that you really need someone
That always will be true
So what's the problem of finding this someone
I need somebody too
I need a chance to prove to you
All the things I say and do
I only do to make you happy
And in my mind I've made the plans
As soon as we both get the chance
I will make all these things happen

If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
I want you girl
If all you want is me then all I want is you
I want you lady

Don't make excuses don't tell me sad stories
Let's get things sorted out
Don't change your mind
Don't let a big chance get smaller
In this dream there's no doubt
We need a day to be alone
Say the things that are unknown
I only want to make you happy
And in my mind I've made the plans
As soon as we both get the chance
I will make all these things happen

If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
Yeah
If all you want is me then all I want is you
I want you girl
If all you want is me then all I want is you
I want you lady
If all you want is me then all I want is you
I want you girl
If all you want is me then all I want is you
Yeah

If all you want is me then all I want is you
If all you want is me then all I want is you
