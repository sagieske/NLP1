Song:

[Intro: 2 chainz]
Yeah
Birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that louie store

[Hook: 2 chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this s**t up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
When I die, bury me inside the gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the louie store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl
All I want for my birthday is a big booty girl

[Verse 1: 2 chainz]
She got a big booty so I call her big booty
Scrr scrr, wrists moving, cookin' to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a? I got bands everywhere
You the realest n***a breathin' if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, hold his tech
Extendo, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon
See I done have more bars than pakistan
Bomb, bomb, and a bomb
She?, I'm borin' you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the truey store
True to my religion, true everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to 2 b*****s

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: kanye west]
Ah, yeezy yeezy how you doing huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh?
She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the T. V on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a menaj
'Specially if you put that bmw in the garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib
Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "do better"
She said, "how 'bout I get you jewelry from the weston?"
How 'bout she hit the west end and get her best friend?
I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' s**t
We in kanye west's benz, cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: 2 chainz (kanye west)]
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad b*****s contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad b*****s contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the mercy)
Tell the dj play your song, this s**t come on
(What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it good, get it good, get it get it good
I might switch it up and get you good

[Hook:]

[Outro: 2 chainz (kanye west)]
Deuce and ye
We like snoop and dre
And this your birthday, baby?
You deserve a coupe today
(You in first place, you in first place)
(Bad b*****s contest you in first place!)
