Song:

I'm feeling out of bounds, out of bounds
I'm running out of time, out of time
I know there's no such thing as either of them
But it's doesn't make me feel any better

Out of sight, out of mind
Out of sight, out of mind
We're out of time
We're out of mind
Out of mind
Out of mind
Yeah, yeah

I'm feeling overwhelmed, overwhelmed
It's getting out of line, line, line
I know I'm not alone
Just adolescents, you and I
It doesn't make me feel any better

Out of sight, out of mind
Out of sight, out of mind
We're out of time
We're out of mind
Out of mind
Out of mind
Yeah, yeah
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of sight, out of mind
We're out of time
We're out of mind
Out of mind
Out of mind
We're out of mind
Yeah
