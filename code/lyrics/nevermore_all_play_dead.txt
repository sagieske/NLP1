Song:

"I know she can hear me still.
I know she can feel me. The velvet sleep
Has stilled her, for they are feeding, while
Time is ever shifting"

You are the wine of intoxicating faith
You are the axis of time, I am so blind

Bear witness to freedom's fall
Tomorrow kiss goodbye a little more, as they watch us all
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room where no one sees, I'll play dead
All play dead

Play dead never speak, just assign the blame
According to their game and chase them down the drain
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room where no one sees, I'll play dead
I'll just sit here quietly and watch them feed, all play dead
All play dead

Bear witness to freedom's fall
Tomorrow kiss goodbye a little more, as they watch us all
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room where no one sees, I'll play dead
I'll just sit here quietly and watch them feed, all play dead
All play dead
All play dead
All play dead
All play dead
All play dead
