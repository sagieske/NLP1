Song:

I would love to give you everything every tone every tune
N I would fall if you wont stop pushing me more
You give me so much pleasure too much presure
N it fell so sad when
You still care asking me why

You dream of being the most so called beautifool, beautifool, beautifool
Tonight.. Go out like that n make a fool of yourself
You dream of being the most so called beautifool, beautifool, beautifool
Tonight.. Go out like that n make a fool of yourself

I would love to give you everything every tone every tune
N I would fall if you wont stop loving me more

You.. So so beautifool, so be a good girl
N don't walk like that n make a fool of yourself
