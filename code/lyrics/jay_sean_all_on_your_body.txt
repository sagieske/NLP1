All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl

Girl you’re too fine 10 out of 10
I'll be your rude boy ad your gentleman
So just let me do it
I’ll be your special friend
Call me whenever you need me
Girl I’ll be your take us all

You know no lie so let’s go

Girl you know you the s**t
Can’t get enough of it
Sweeter than liquorish
When I get up on it
So just let me do it
I’ll be your special friend
Call me whenever you need me
Cause baby I can fool a tube

Can say you really need somebody
To coke over and appease your body
I ain’t even gonna tell nobody
That I was getting all up in your body

All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl

Rubbing in touching in kissing on me
Said you got a man girl
What’s it gonna be?
So just let me do it
I’ll be your special friend
Call me whenever you need me
I take you so high
You know
No lie
So let’s go

So baby I can tell that you
Can say you really need somebody
To coke over and appease your body
I ain’t even gonna tell nobody
That I was getting all up in your body
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl

O o o open a cookie jar
Put my tongue in the goodies
Tell her gimme that p***y
I swear to God I’m a bullet
Nothing close to a rookie
Keep my clip on a foolie
Shorty bad as a felon
Know I want it she looking
The things I would do to you
How you scream hallelujah
Your body your goddess
Just I got to get time with you
You sock with a Theraflu
This chocolate body

So baby I can tell that you
Can say you really need somebody
To coke over and appease your body
I ain’t even gonna tell nobody
That I was getting all up in your body
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
All on your body
A a a all on your body girl
