Song:

Tomorrow morning if you wake up
And the sun does not appear
I will be here
If in the dark we lose sight of love
Hold my hand and have no fear
I will be here
I will be here
When you feel like being quiet
When you need to speak your mind
I will listen
I will be here
When the laughter turns to crying
Through the winning, losing and trying
We'll be together
'Cause I will be here
Tomorrow morning if you wake up
And the future is unclear
I will be here
As sure as seasons are made for change
Our lifetimes are made for years
I will be here
I will be here
And you can cry on my shoulder
When the mirror tells us were older
I will hold you
I will be here
To watch you grow in beauty
And tell you all the things you are to me
I will be here
I will be true to the promise I have made
To you and to the one who gave you to me
(I will be here....
As sure as seasons are made for change
Our lifetimes are made for years
I will be here
We'll be together, because I will be here...)
