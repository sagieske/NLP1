Song:

[Chorus:]
Elijah Rock shout shout
Elijah Rock comin' up Lord
Elijah Rock shout shout
Elijah Rock comin' up Lord

Satan is a liar and a conjure too
If you don't (mind high) watch out
He'll conjure you
If I could I sho'ly would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
[Chorus:]

Ezekiel said he saw him
Wheel in the mid' of a wheel
John talked about him
In the book of the 7 seals
Some say the Rose of Sharon
Others say the Prince of Peace
But I can tell everybody (this ol' world)
He been a rock and a shelter for me
Hallelujah
[Chorus:]

You can call my rock in the morning
Call him late at night
He's always with me
And all my battles he'll fight
When I'm in trouble
I can call him on the line
He put a telephone in my heart (bosom)
And I can call God anytime
Hallelujah
[Chorus:]
