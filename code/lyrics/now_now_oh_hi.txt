Song:

You don't have to go you could come inside
But you don't tell me when you sleep at night
You could come into my room if you like
But I won't make a sound if you turn the light

I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long

You don't have to say it twice
Because I've done a lot of things tonight
And I'd take a part of me and put it on your skin if you'd let me

I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long

You silly girl you're just too far
But you can come to me if you want

I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long
I've been gone for much too long
