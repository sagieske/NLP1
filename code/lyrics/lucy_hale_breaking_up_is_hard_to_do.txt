Song:

Don't take your love
Away from me
Don't you leave my heart
In misery

If you go then I'll be blue
Cause breakin' up is hard to do

They say that breakin' up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breakin' up
I wish that we were makin' up again

I beg of you
Don't say goodbye
Can we give our love just a one more try
Come on baby, let's start anew
Cause breakin'up is hard to do
Breakin' up is hard to do
