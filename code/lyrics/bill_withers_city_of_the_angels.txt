Song:

City of the angels spread your wings for me
I've been other places lookin for my dream
Eastern cities move to fast
Southern ones to slow
I can't go back to my past
And I need someplace to grow

City of the Angels
Clear your cloudy skies for me
I heard you got some places that I oughta see
Heard you got a disneyland not too far away
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

La, la, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please
It's where I wanna be

City of the Angels spread your wings for me
I heard you got some places an old man like me should see
Heard 'bout your disneyland not too far away from town
When it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

La, la, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please
It's where I wanna be

I heard you got a disneyland not to far away
And when it rains I understand the skies are clear all day

La, la, find a place for me
Gimme all your spaces please
It's where I wanna be
