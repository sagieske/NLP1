Song:

Got our own personal infallible
Secretaries to exhibit our hearts devoted to art
It will take the drudgery out of writing for you and finally adjust the
Creative part.
No one has the slightest clue, where omega can be
Tap fear in your constituents
Evil hates everyone equally
Evil hates everyone equally

Everything I touch turns into vernacular
She's been speaking that way, since the day I fingered her
Our species will believe anything
Even Tabula Rasa, could have become the king
It's so easy to manipulate Take a seat I'll demonstrate
Now you've learned to listen, think, and respond
It only took a few words, and some waves from this wand
You're entitled to things that don't exist
Soon you won't be able to
Tell the difference between your stories and pornographic memories
I can't believe I found dirty pictures of you in the multi-verse

Everything in this world is run by your computer
Everything in this world is run by your computer
Welcome to the hallmark of our consciousness.
There's something inside of you that wants you to change
There's something inside of you that wants you to change
And it's me, And it's him, And it's her, And it's them, And it's f****d
And it's him, And it's her, And it's them, And it's f****d
We're all about to get the hammer
Everyone gets nailed today
Bridging generation gaps, one modem at a time.
We're all about to get the hammer
Everyone gets nailed today
Bridging generation gaps, one modem at a time
It's shutting down, It's shutting down,
Are you ready to understand, to survive again
We're not who you think you know
The horrible awakening of intangible postmortem
Happens when you realize that
It's shutting down, It's shutting down,
Are you ready to understand, to survive again
We're not who you think you know
The horrible awakening of intangible postmortem
Happens when you realize that
