Song:

I see the color in your eyes
They set me free
And they get me high
No sister flower
Will be denied, girl
The heat of the affection
A fragile mind

Because of you (you)
My dreams came true
Because of you

Becuase of you
Yeah
My dreams came true
Because of you

And I feel the warmth in your touch
My ego trips
I can't get enough
That satisfaction
Lies in your hands girl
I wrote this song
So you'll understand

Because of you (you)
My dreams came true
Because of you

Because of you
My dreams came true
Because of you

(Because of you)
(Because of you)

Because of you
My dream came true
Because of you

Because of you
My dreams came true
Because of you

Because of you
My dreams came true
Because of you

Because of you
Because of you
