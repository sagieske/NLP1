Song:

(Hess/Lesperance)
There's no wind in the morning to drive the mill today
There's the temple where she worships
But her faith has gone away
And she won't go out in the evening
She lost her soul in the day
The cold fish in all her glory was the pride of yesterday
But now a "don't even bother" feeling that just won't go away
And she won't go out in the evening
She lost her soul in the day
It all ends too soon
Following tormented youth, caught in the womb
Bold and desperate tries to immortalize our lives
Following profits and fools to God with a broom
Sweeping up the tries, still the carpet's on the rise
And that's all
