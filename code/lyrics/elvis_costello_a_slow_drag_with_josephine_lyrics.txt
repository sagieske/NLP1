Song:

The snitch, the snoop, the tattletale lead a threadbare up the stairs
Adieu, my little ballyhoo, you broke my heart in two
And now I haunt the bars and scent those trite affairs
She went home to gather her comb and caught him unawares

And there was her man enjoying the lay of the land
He took a walk in the dark with a dish from the stand
Girls and their creations, tight in the brightest grenadine
But I'd take all that I've seen for a slow drag with Josephine

Josephine, Josephine
But I'd trade all that I've seen for
A slow drag with Josephine

Gavotte, garrotes, Cotillions and slow Arabesques
Drum rolls and Farandoles were all made in jest
But when you make that move, I can't resist
When will you declare your armistice?

Josephine, Josephine
But I'd trade all that I've seen for
A slow drag with Josephine

In another time and place, a different fate was cast
He tried to skeddle-daddle-do, she might have slapped him
Just for saying, "Grant one more chance before you pass
Then curse the nurse that named me the first or bury me at last"

And in three-quarter time, the true and the false
Dancing the 'Hesitation Waltz'
Then comes the flirtation and temptation
Hip, hip, hooray, listen to what I say
Then you can take it away
