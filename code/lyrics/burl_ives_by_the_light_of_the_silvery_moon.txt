Song:

16. By the light of the silvery moon

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Honeymoon keep a-shining in June,
Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Honeymoon keep a-shining in June,
Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune
Honeymoon keep a-shining in June,
Your silv'ry beams will bring love dreams
We'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon
