Song:

I have lived a life of sin, in this world I'm living in
I have done forbidden things I shouldn't do
I ask a beggar along the way if he could tell me where to stay
Where I could find real happiness and love that's true
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow
Across the bridge there's no more pain
The sun will shine across the river
And you'll never be unhappy again
[ organ ]
Follow the footsteps of the King, till you hear the voices ring
They'll be singing out the glory of the Land
The river Jordan will be new, and the sound of trumpet you will hear
And you'll behold the most precious place never known to man
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow...
Across the bridge there's no more sorrow...
