Song:

Through the miles
I cannot escape
My fate I know will come in time
With my back to the wind
I cheated again with a smile

Fortune and blood billowing up
The truth I cannot speak
But I made it back one last time

Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

Tales untold
Never to know
Unspeakable until the end
All these mysteries
I'll never speak of again

That my love
I hope you believe
Now I'm gonna give you every part of me
I am home

Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

But please keep holding on
Stay tonight
I need your love
And don't say goodbye
My sweet Avalon

(Solo)

Oh, Avalon
It's been way too long
I can see in your eyes
The fire is all but gone

My sweet Avalon
It's been way too long
Avalon, it's been way too long
Avalon

(Outro solo)
