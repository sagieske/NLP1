Song:

Falling apart and tearing at the seams
Tribulation lends a hand and squeezes all your hopes and dreams
You say you retreat, you say you just can't win
Before you let your circumstance tell you how the story ends

(God's word) His word says you can stand,
He'll cover you with His grace
Everything you need is in your hand,
So lift up your head and say

Chorus:
All things are working for me, even things I can't see
Your ways are so beyond me,
But You said that you would let it be for my good,
So I'll rest and just believe

Verse 2:
I know you say you've got it bad right now,
Let me say I know that feeling well,
To make good plans for life and then watch them take a
Downward spin
Let me encourage you while I encourage me
See the raging rain and wind but He'll speak peace and it will come to an end

(The truth is)The truth is He cannot lie,
I'm in His hands and I'm on his mind,
Promised me He'd always be there,
So by faith He will answer my prayer

Chorus

Bridge:
Many days and nights I cried because I felt let down
But I won't always receive good but a praise in my heart will remain
So with tears in your eyes know sometimes it might get rough
But say Lord I love you more and that is enough to know
All things are working for me, even things I can't see
Your ways are so beyond me,
But You said that you would let it be for my good,
So I'll rest and just believe

Chorus
