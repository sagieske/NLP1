Song:

Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you
All the time
But you're out there And I'm here waiting

And I wrote this letter in my head
''cause so many things
Were left unsaid
But now your gone
And i can't think straight

This could be
The one last chance
To make you understand
Yeah..

Chorus
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you
In the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
''cause i know
I won't forget you

Together we broke
All the rules
Dreaming of dropping out
Of school
And leave this place
To never come back

So now maybe after all
These years
If you miss me have no fear
I'll be here
I'll be waiting

This could be the one last
Chance to make you
Understand
And i just can't let you
Leave me once again
Yeah...

Chorus
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you
In the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
''cause i know
I won't forget you

I close me eyes
And all I see is you
I close my eyes
I try to sleep
I can't forget you
Na na na
Na na na


I'd do anything for you
Na na na
Na na na

Chorus
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
Somehow I can't put you
In the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
To fall asleep with you
With you yeah

I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
There's nothing i won't do
I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
''cause I know
I won't forget you
