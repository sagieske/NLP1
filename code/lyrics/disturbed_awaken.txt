Song:

Stripped of life, alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
Wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life

Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I want to live with the lie
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me
Ahhhkk,
Awaken you
Oohhh No,
Can't live up to me
Suuure
I've stricken you

Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Stripped of life, alone
In the midst of something that I
Want to play with your evil inside
Wanting, letting go, of what never could be again
Lost and alone
Imprisoned now inside your mind
With the way you tried
To destroy me again
You were waiting and living for no one
With the way you tried
To completely refuse all your life

Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me

Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I want to live with the lie
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me
Ahhhkk,
Awaken you
Oohhh No,
Can't live up to me
Suuure
I've stricken you
Oohhh,
Can't live up to me

There isn't a thing that I can do
Watching this whole thing just wash away
Making me numb
There isn't a thing that I can do
Watching this whole thing just wash away
Making me numb
Making you strong

Ahhhkk,
Awaken you
With a little evil inside
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
I've stricken you
I don't want to live with the lie
Feed on your nothing
And you'll never live up to me
Ahhhkk,
Oohhh,
Can't live up to me
Ahhhkk,
Feed on your nothing
You'll never live up to me
