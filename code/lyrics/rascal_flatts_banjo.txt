Song:

You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you're gettin' close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road and you go, and you go and you go-go-go
'Til you hear banjo

It ain't on the map
And I'm glad it isn't
Leave the phone and the gps, those satellites ain't found it yet,
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden
