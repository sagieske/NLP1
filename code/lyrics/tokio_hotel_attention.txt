Song:

I'm trying to tell you
I'm trying to know you
I'm dying to show you
Fighting to get you

Soon as you got me
You go and drop me
It's cruel when you burn me
I love how you hurt me

Oh no, I'll never let you go
Oh no, I hate that I need you so

It's not what you said
It's the way you say it
It's not what you did
It's the way you do it
Sick and tired of needing your affection
I chose to be lonely than live without your
Attention

I scratched your sweet name
Right into my skin
You left me bleeding
But I couldn't give in

I swallowed all the poison to get infected
Give back my heart that you body rejected

Oh no, I'll never let you go
Oh no, I hate that I need you so

It's not what you said
It's the way you say it
It's not what you did
It's the way you do it
Sick and tired of needing your affection
I chose to be lonely than live without your
Attention

I'm standing in the pain
That's smothering me
It's more becoming my own blood
Why can't you see?
That I'm starving for your love
And I need attention
Or I'm gonna die

It's not what you said
It's the way you say it
It's not what you did
It's the way you do it
Sick and tired of needing your affection
I chose to be lonely than live without your
Attention
