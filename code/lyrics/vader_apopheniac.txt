Song:

The cities of the brain are vast
No map charts to urge
To find the nexus of it all
The lines converge, my vision clears
Now I think I can finally see
The world for what it's always been
Torrent of signals, storm of date
Pattern recognition floods
The wall of noise to breach
Revelation trembling on my lips
The godhead eludes me at all times
(Lead: Peter)
Messages assault the senses
Decoding is A futile task
A hieroglyphic world in sight
(Lead: Peter)
I wish some semiology of madness
Could explain all this to me
As more new connection emerge
My life in the maze...
The web grows and tightens
The word seems to take shape
Frightful lucidity is mine
I am an apopheniac
The lines converge, my vision clears
Now I think I can finally see
The world for what it's always been
