Song:

This alligator engine
This alligator man
See him try to leave this swampland
Drove it out across this land, and see
All the guards get petrified
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
See him try to leave this swampland
Wriggle out across this ground and then
All the guards are screaming now
'Cos this territory's cold
This alligator engine
This alligator soul
He tried to leave this swampland
To wriggle out up of his hole
And then all the guards are screaming now
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
Goes out across this swampland
Wriggles out across this ground and see
All the guards are screaming now
This territory's cold
This alligator engine
This alligator man
Wriggle out across this swampland
Drove it out across this land, and see
All the guards get petrified
As he pushed them to the ground
With this alligator engine
With this alligator sound
