Song:

And when the time is right
It's gonna change the word
And with the darken sky
There is nothing thrill

And there is no more love
Or f*****g gates of pearl

I see the seven stars
I see the seven stands
I hear the deadly voice
I count the sense we have

I am the living one
I am the first to last

[Chorus:]

The Crowds the noise the change in the god
It's such a strange celebration
Kids they laugh
There's fire that eats up the world
It's such a such a strange celebration
All of eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration

And they know who we are
The seven angels sing
And several billion die
With the earth shaking
Yeah they know who we are
And they will set us free

[Chorus:]

The Crowds the noise the change in the god
It's such a strange celebration
Kids they laugh
There's fire that eats up this world
It's such a such a strange celebration
All of eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration

(Chorus)x2

The Crowds the noise the change in the god
It's such a strange celebration
Kids they laugh
There's fire that eats up this world
It's such a such a strange celebration
All of eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration

The Crowds the noise the change in the god
It's such a strange celebration
Kids they laugh
There's fire that eats up this world
It's such a such a strange celebration
All of eyes are burned by heaven and earth
It's such a strange celebration
