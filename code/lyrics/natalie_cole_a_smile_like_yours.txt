Song:

Hmm, thought I'd seen everything there was to see in this world

Now I'm not so sure I've really seen anything at all

I thought life could show me no surprises

And then you came and showed me I was wrong

I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry

I have seen miracles that moved my soul, days that changed my life

I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark

Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile

As beautiful as yours, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, I thought I'd been everywhere

I've climbed a mountain so high, sailed the sea, crossed the sky

And still I was nowhere at all, until that day, oh, you came to my senses

And your smile, it made sense out of it all, (I have seen the bluest skies)

Rainbows that would make you cry, I have seen miracles

(miracles that moved me soul) that moved my soul, days that changed my life,

I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark

Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile as beautiful as yours

(smile so beautiful) so beautiful, comes one time in a lifetime

A smile this beautiful, (a smile this beautiful) I've never dreamed I'd ever see, oh

(I have seen the bluest skies) I have seen it, (rainbows that would make you cry)

That would make you cry, I've seen miracles (miracles) moved my soul,

(days that changed my life) and days that changed my life

I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark

Oh, I've seen the wonders of this world (wonders of the world)

But I've never seen a smile (never seen a smile before as beautiful as yours)

Oh, I've never seen a smile before, (never seen a smile before as beautiful)

As beautiful as yours.
