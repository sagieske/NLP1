Song:

We say it's okay and to leave it alone
But I want you to notice this case isn't closed
Doors are open, the lights are left on
And there's never a night I sleep, with the dreams that I'd have
If you never decided, decided to leave
Decided, decided to leave

There's never an ounce that I breath without thinking about who I could have been if you
There's never an ounce that I breath without thinking about who I could have been if you didn't leave

The phone's been patient to hear your call, but you never touch the dial
You never touch the dial, so now I know
There's someone I wished walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home

We say we can learn from this, but I just don't know what to do without you anymore
Your absence is taking it's toll on me
What I should believe, I just can't believe
There's never an ounce that I breath without thinking about who I could have
Been if you
There's never an ounce that I breath without thinking about who I could have been if you didn't leave

The phone's been patient to hear your call, but you never touch the dial
You never touch the dial, so now I know
There's someone I wished walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home

You say it isn't my fault so I steer away
I put off the pain for another day
Did you think it wouldn't be tough?
8 years was never enough
I'll wait for you
If you never change I will be okay
But I still stay up for you
Just in case you make time for the right move

The phone's been patient to hear your call, but you never touch the dial
You never touch the dial, so now I know
There's someone I wished walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home

There's someone I wished walked through these halls
But you never touch the dial
You'll never touch the dial, so now I know
The phone's been patient to hear your call, but you never take the chance to come home
And you'll never take the chance to come home
Just come home
