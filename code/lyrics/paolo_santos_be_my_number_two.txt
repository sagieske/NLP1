Song:

Performed by: Paolo Santos
Written by: Joe Jackson

Won't you be my Number Two
Me and Number One are through
There won't be too much to do
Just smile when I feel blue

And there's not much left of me
What you get is what you see
Is it worth the energy
I leave it up to you

Chorus
And if you got somethin' to say to me
Don't try to lay off on your ways on me
I know that it's really not fair of me
But my heart seen too much action

Every time I look at you
You'll be who I want you to
And I'll do what I can do
To make a dream or two come true
If you'd be my Number Two

Ad lib

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat 3rd stanza]
