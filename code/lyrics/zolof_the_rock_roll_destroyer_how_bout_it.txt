Song:

Everbody's got the gloom
But I'm routing for you, I'm routing for you
Everybody dabbles in the dumps but you're number one and I'm number one too. (Three Four!)
My mom called your mom. Gossip goes on and on.
Hey! Hey! How bout it?
(How bout it!) How bout it?
If we're a train then you're the caboose, but no one rides you because you're not red you're blue
Everbody's got the gloom
But I'm routing for you, I'm in this with you
(This jalopy goes everywhere!)
My mom called your mom. Gossip goes on and on.
Hey! Hey! How bout it?
(How bout it!) How bout it?
Woo! How bout it? (How bout it!) How bout it?
I'm in this with you, we get on so well.
I'm in this with you, we get on so well.
I'm in this with you, we get on so well.
I'm in this with in this with in with in this (sandwhiches)
I'm in this with you, we get on so well. (how bout it)
I'm in this with you, we get on so well. (how bout it)
I'm in this with you, we get on so well. (how bout it)
Yeah!!!
