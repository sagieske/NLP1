Song:

Girl I wished I'd never known you
And I wished I'd never loved you
Should've neverever held you
Let along keep thinking of you
The smell of your perfume
Still lingers in my room
I can never forget
Why figure on that side of bed
How I wish
You'd never ever leave me
I can resist but reminisce
I'll cease to exist
Baby please
Make room to forgive me
I can't replace that pretty face
I can never love again
Bridge;
If I could I would've brought you here
And turn back the time
When you were mine and we would vow
This love will never die
If I could I'd never say those words
That hurts you so bad
So baby please.. I'm on my knees
Gotta come back
If I could I would've told you
That I'm over you
Would've never ever let you
See me crying for you
But everytime I go to sleep
Thoughts of you keep haunting me
How the heck can I bear
Your sweet laughter's in the air
How I wish
You'd tell me I am dreaming
I have no choice.., I miss your voice
Girl you have to make it ring
Baby please
I can't go through another day
I can't go back, I can't live baby
So tell me what I have to do
Chorus;
Oh baby
Tell me what I have to do
I've been losing sleep and I just can eat
Without you, no one will do
Baby please, sugar please
You never can deny
What we had was good, and it's so good
Take my hand, come home
So whenever you need me just come home
If you're willing to forgive me, come home
You'll know I'll be around, come home
I'm so lonely.... Lonely.... Come home
