Song:

I heard you swear your love this morning
And it caught me almost wanting to believe
The three little words that serve as warning
And say it's just a promise you can't keep

A statement that's been so used
I felt compelled to tell you
But knew there wasn't much to say
I could have threatened leavin'
Or listed hopeless reasons
If I didn't have this need to stay

Three little words should be my warning
'Cause I know that it's a promise you can't keep

A statement that's been so used
I felt compelled to tell you
But knew there wasn't much to say
I could have threatened leavin'
Or listed hopeless reasons
If I didn't have this need to stay

Three little words should be my warning
'Cause I know that it's a promise you can't keep

I heard you swear your love this morning
