Song:

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird),
But here to stay stay stay is a new bird.
He sings a love song,
As we go along,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

Later on (later on! ), we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire, babe
We'll face unafraid
All the plans that we've made,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.

And later on (later on! ), we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
We'll face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made.
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

We'll face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made.
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

We'll face unafraid,
All the plans that we've made,
We're walking in a winter wonderland.
(Walking in a winter wonderland.)
