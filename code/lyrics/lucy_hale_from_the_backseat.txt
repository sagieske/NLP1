Song:

You were burning in a 94 Corolla
3 hours deep in the South Dakota
I was workin' on a luke warm Coca-Cola
In the dog days of July

And my dad was a Superman stick shift driver
Stay at home Lois Lane beside him
Kissing to the rhythm of the billboard signs
As they went blurring by
Even when he would stop to pull over,
He never took his hand off of her shoulder

Chorus:
You can see for miles, you can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun, you can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sittin' shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

So late one day and I'm rolling along
With a part time job and blue pom-poms
Like everyday's a knock off mellowcamp song
With his hand right on my knee

We made the age old prom-night promise
Put the corsage right where I want it
We found a road with nobody on it
And we didn't stop to think
And I didn't care when he killed the motor
Shut off the lights and we climbed over

Chorus:
You can see for miles, you can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun, you can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sittin' shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

Up here, I see it clear through the rear-view
It's good to take the backseat when you get to

Chorus:
You can see for miles, you can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun, you can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sittin' shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love...
You can see for miles, you can reach the dials
Sit back and smile from the front seat
You can chase the sun, you can feel the hum
Of the axles underneath your feet
When you're sittin' shotgun
You seem pretty and free
But you learn to love from the backseat

We were burning in a 94 Corolla
3 hours deep in the South Dakota
I was workin' on a luke warm Coca-Cola
