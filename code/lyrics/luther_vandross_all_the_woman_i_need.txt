Song:

I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before she came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now you're here it's not the same
It's not the same

She builds me up
She gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
She's all I got
She's all I got in this world
And she's all the woman that I need

And in the morning when I kiss her eyes
She takes me down and rocks me slow
And in the evening when the moon is high
She holds me close and won't let go
She won't let go

She builds me up
She gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
She's all I got
She's all I got in this world
And she's all the woman that I need
