Song:

Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

So am I wrong?
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Am I tripping for having a vision?
My prediction: I'ma be on the top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back, always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel

Am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong?
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

So am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
Now am I wrong? (Am I wrong?)
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah)
But that's just how I feel, 
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
