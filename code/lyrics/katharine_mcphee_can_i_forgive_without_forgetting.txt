Song:

Can I forgive without forgetting?
A sea of tears that wouldn't wash away the pain
The well is poisoned, can things ever be the same
How can I Iet you touch me, let you love me?
The scars are still there
From what you've done to us

Why did you hurt me? What was missing between us?
Where did I go wrong? I've been waiting for the reasons.
Should I forgive you?

I can't believe - that through it all
That I can't forget that I have always loved you
But you expect too much
To want me to forgive without forgetting
All that you've done to us
And now you're telling me
This time you want to stay with me
Every minute every day

You'll never leave again
Can't believe, just can't believe
How you left me broken hearted and betrayed
You ask too much of me
To think about the faith I once had in you

But you were so untrue
You say you're sorry now
And you will guarantee me
You've always loved - still in love with me

I know that I have always loved you
Right from the moment when you came into my life
There is no one in the world
Who can do to me - what you do to me
By just being close to me
You excite me so, I can't breathe.

Still, how could you hurt me, what was missing?
Why did you leave me?
Where did I go wrong?
Was there someone else?
Was she pretty?

I've got to know
Ooooooooooooooooooooh!

I can forgive but not forget
Still I can't forget that I have always loved you
But don't expect too much
Can I really forgive without forgetting
All that you've done to us

And now you're telling me
That you wanna stay with me
Every minute, every day,
If I believe in what you say

Gotta find another way
To forgive and forget
And start all over

There's no way out for me
'cause you're still the pulse that makes my heart beat
Without you I will be
A ship alone at sea and no safe harbor it can see
That's how I feel when you're not with me
That's how I feel when you're not with me
