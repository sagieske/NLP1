Song:

You are the queen, and I'm your servant
This pair of twins, split by a cruel fate
As long as I can protect you, I will become evil on your behalf

We were born beneath great expectations
And those church bells blessed our arrival
Because of self choices, we were separated into different paths

Even if this entire world, turns against you
I will be here to defend you, all you gotta do is smile

You are the queen, and I'm your servant
This pair of twins spilt by a cruel fate
As long as I get to protect you, I will become evil on your behalf

One day I went to visit the great land from afar
There I met a beautiful lady of green
I was overwhelmed with her pretty self, I fell in love right then and there

But if the queen wishes, for her to disappear, I shall do so
But how is it I that I wont stop crying?

You are the queen and I'm your servant
A strange pair of twins split by a cruel fate
Today for snack will be something made just for yoy
When you smile, it looks so innocent
The townspeople will be coming for you soon, and try to tear this place
Brick by brick
If this means getting rid of you, will never let you be taken alive

"Here, please take my clothes
Put them on and escape this mad place
No need to be upset, we are twins so nobody will be able to tell your the
Original queen

I am the queen and your the run away
A pair a twins split by a cruel a fate
If they lable you as evil, then I am as well
Since it runs through our blood

A long, long time ago
There were two siblings
And at the top was my, very own queen

(Len) Even if the entire world, turns against you
I'll will always protect you from somewhere else
So promise to be happy in another life
(Rin) Looks like time has arrived, the bells tells us how it ends
Facing me without a look at the crowd, you say my favorite line

You are the queen, and I'm your servant
This pair of twins spilt by a cruel fate
As long as I get to protect you, I will become evil on your behalf

If we ever get reborn, will you play with me?
