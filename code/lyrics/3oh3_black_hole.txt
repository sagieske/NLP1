Song:

Hello yeah it’s me again – no homo sapien
I’m an ancient alien – was sent to take your women
You could say we’re winning – more than Charlie Sheen is
And don’t get mad at me because your girl was on my d**k,
You know that we’re rocking the computer – Steven Hawking
And if that b***h hangs up on me again you know I’m walkin…
Like Christopher – never catch me kissin on the mistletoe cause this is missile crisis time to light em up – go

Cold woman – she sucked me in…
No air – and I’ll never see the light again…

I fell into a black hole…

Don’t get angry bird like I just hopped out the pig pen
I’m used to havin hands on me – yeah you can call me Big Ben
It’s time to get stupid – yeah it’s time to get Kardashian
So pour that whiskey deep and hand that motherfucking flask again
You’re a massive black hole – and you say that I’m the a*****e
When I saw you at the last show – you were on me like a shadow
Up the creek, no paddle – tell my Mommy and my Dad oh I aint never comin back
She sucked me in a black hole

Cold woman – she sucked me in…
No air – and I’ll never see the light again…

I fell into a black hole…
