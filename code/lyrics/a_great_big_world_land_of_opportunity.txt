Song:

I'm sailing away
To a land of opportunity.
The sun will shine
And birds will sing every day.
I'm sailing away
And I hope that you remember me.
It was fun, we had our run, hip hooray!

You said hello.
I loved you so
Just like a movie scene.
I want you to know
I had to let go
I've fallen in love again.

I'm running away
To a place where you won't bother me.
We won't talk for a while.
We'll be okay.
And I'm changing my name
To a word that's really hard to say.
It's no one's fault
I'm just too young
And you're insane.

I wasted my time.
I missed all the signs,
And it ruined my holiday.
I want you to know
I had to let go.
I'm falling in love again.

I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
I just gotta believe, I just gotta believe!

You said hello
I loved you so
I felt like a kid again.
I want you to know
I had to let go
I'm falling in love again.

I just gotta believe there's something better.
I just gotta believe there's something more than you and me.
I just gotta believe, I just gotta believe!

I'm sailing away
To a land of opportunity.
