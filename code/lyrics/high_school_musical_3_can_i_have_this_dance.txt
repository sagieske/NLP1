Song:

Take my hand,
Take a breath,
Pull me close,
Take one step,
Keep your eyes locked on mine
And let the music be your guide.

Won't you promise me
(Now won't you promise me, that you'll never forget)
You'll keep dancing
(To keep dancing)
Where ever we go next.

It's like catching lightning,
The chances of finding someone like you.
It's one in a million,
The chances of feeling the way we do.
And with every step together,
We just keep on getting better.
So can I have this dance?
(Can I have this dance)
Can I Have this dance?

Take my hand,
I'll take the lead,
And every turn will be safe with me,
Don't be afraid,
Afraid to fall,
You know I'll catch you through it all

And you can't keep us apart
(Even a thousand miles can't keep us apart)
Cos my heart is where ever you are

It's like catching lightning,
The chances of finding someone like you.
It's one in a million,
The chances of feeling the way we do.
And with every step together,
We just keep on getting better.
So can I have this dance?
(Can I have this dance)
Can I Have this dance?

Ohh no mountains too high and no oceans too wide,
Cause together or not, our dance won't stop.
Let it rain, let it pour.
What we have is worth fighting for.
You know I believe that we were meant to be.

Oooohhh.

It's like catching lightning,
The chances of finding someone like you (like you)
It's one in a million,
The chances of feeling the way (way) we do.
And with every step together,
We just keep on getting better.
So can I have this dance?
(Can I have this dance)
Can I have this dance?

Can I have this dance,
Can I have this dance?
