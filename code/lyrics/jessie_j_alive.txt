Song:

[Verse:]
This is it, now it’s in our hands
I know you feel it
We could’ve quit but we choose to dance
But best believe it

[Pre-Chorus:]
We took it in baby from the start
We choose the light and forgot the dark
So bright this moment with a million stars (stars)
So everybody sing with me

[Chorus:]
Luckily see you ‘cause of I
Don’t play on it because tonight
We’re flying free like birds in the sky
‘Cause we’re alive (live)
Let’s raise a glass to you and I
Let’s show and tell that we survived
We’re flying free like birds in the sky
‘Cause we’re alive
(1, 2, 3) We’re alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) We’re alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (live, live)

[Verse:]
Here we are, now it’s in our hands
Oh yea we feel it
Don’t let it stop, you got to dance
But best believe it

[Pre-Chorus:]
We took it in baby from the start
We choose the light and forgot the dark
So bright this moment with a million stars (stars)
So everybody sing with me

[Chorus:]
Luckily see you ‘cause of I
Don’t play on it because tonight
We’re flying free like birds in the sky
‘Cause we’re alive (live)
Let’s raise a glass to you and I
Let’s show and tell that we survived
We’re flying free like birds in the sky
‘Cause we’re alive
(1, 2, 3) We’re alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) We’re alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (live, live)

(1, 2, 3) We’re alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (oh oh)
(1, 2, 3) So alive! (live, live)
