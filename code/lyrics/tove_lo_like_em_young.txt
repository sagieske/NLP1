Song:

Oh, oh
Hey boy, you're too young for me
But I don't care, 'cause you're what I see
I like em young, I like em young
Eyes wide, boy you're so naive
Thinking no one knows better than me
I like em young, I like em young

And you keep make me wonder
Age is just a number
That they don't think about
That's all I think about

I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em

Hey girl, why you judging me
When your guy's turning 53
I like em young, I like em young
I don't know what really gets you more
Is it that my guy's gonna live out yours?
I like em young, I like em young
They say they don't care but I

I can tell they're lying
'Cause we're all slowly dying
Tryina work it out, and all I think about

I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em

Life I live mine, alone not one kind
All it's fair in love and war
My manners out the door
What do I need them for?

I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em young, I like em young
I like em young, I like em young
Young like me, with the mind so easy
I like em young
