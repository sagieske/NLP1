Song:

Lift me up
Take me down
You can turn my world around

I can hear
What people say
It doesn't matter anyway

We're not the same but
So much alike
You are my brother
My sister tonight
We got

One Life
Living together in
One life
Let us be free
One Life
You take my troubles away
Light up my day-ya!

You came here
In the night
Take the worries of your mind

In your eyes
Beneath your skin
I feel the pain you're in

We're not the same but
So much alike
You are my brother
My sister tonight
We got

One Life
Living together in
One Life
Let us be free
One Life
You take my troubles away
Light up my day-ya!

One Life
Living together in
One Life
Let us be free
One Life
You take my troubles away
Light up my day!
