Song:

Lipstick on my cigarette,
How you used to hide the bed
The little s**t that I can’t forget,
I wonder where you are
Still got your apartment key,
Voicemails that I can’t delete
Man I miss how we used to be,
I wonder where you are

I reminisce with the stars tonight,
And think of how we knew them all by name
But they don’t shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away, oh

If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby
Let’s get back together,
Girl I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
Ooh When we get together, it’ll be forever
Ooh When we get together, yaaa
If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby

Last call at the troubadour,
Late night meals after four
Stumbling through my front door,
It just don’t feel the same
Can’t go to our lunch spot
Or grab joe from the coffee shop
Looking down at my phone a lot
But I don’t see your name

I reminisce with the stars tonight,
And think of how we knew them all by name
But they don’t shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away, oh

If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby
Let’s get back together,
Girl I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
Ooh When we get together, it’ll be forever
Ooh When we get together, yaaa
If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby

If we get back together, it’ll be better
If we get back together, better than ever
If we get back together, If we get back together

I reminisce with the stars tonight,
And think of how we knew them all by name
But they don’t shine half as bright
Ever since you walked away, oh

If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby
Let’s get back together,
Girl I swear you are the reason
Love is something worth believing
Ooh When we get together, it’ll be forever
Oh baby, yaaa
If we get back together,
It’ll be like when I met ya
Even better girl I bet ya baby
Let’s get back together
