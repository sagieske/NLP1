Song:

I hope that the world stops raining, 
Stops turning it's back on the young, 
See nobody here is blameless, 
I hope that we can fix all that we've done.
I really hope Martin can see this, 
I hope that we still have a dream, 
I'm hoping that change isn't hopless, 
I'm hoping to start it with me.

I just hope I'm not the only one, 
I just hope I'm not the only one.

I hope we start seeing forever, 
Instead of what we can gain in a day, 
I hope we start seeing each other, 
Cause don't we all bleed the same.
I really hope someone can hear me, 
That a child doesn't bear the weight of a gun, 
Hope I find the voice within me, 
To scream at the top of my lungs.

I just hope I'm not the only one, 
I just hope I'm not the only one.

Louder, I cannot hear you, 
How can things be better left unsaid.
Call me, call me a dreamer, 
But it seems like dreams are all that we've got left.

I hope we still have a heartbeat, 
I hope we don't turn to snow, 
A night when you turn the lights off, 
I hope you don't cry alone.
I hope we stop taking for granted, 
All of the land and all of the sea, 
I'm taking a chance on loving, 
I hope that you take it with me.

I just hope I'm not the only one, 
I just hope I'm not the only one, 
I just hope I'm not the only one.
