Song:

Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze
There's a bar in far Bombay
Come on and fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land there's a one-man band
And he'll toot his flute for you
Come on fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there where the air is rarified
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You may hear all the angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds
Down to Ac apulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

[Instrumental]

Once I get you up there where the air is rarified
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so very near
You may even hear a whole gang cheer 'cause we're together

Weather-wise it's such a cool cool day
You just say those words and we'll beat the birds
Down to Ac apulco Bay
It's so perfect for a flying honeymoon, oh babe
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
Pack up, let's fly away!!
And don“ët tell your mamma!!
