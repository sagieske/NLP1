Song:

The sounds of sirens are flooding the streets tonight
Yet we are all still willing to commit the crimes
Should we expect no consequence (No consequence)
Maybe our lies will pass the test (Will pass the test)

Eyes closed hands tied (Behind our backs we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets and lies
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time)

Your hands are shaking as they're holding onto mine
A sense of hesitation is hidden in your eyes

[Chorus:]
I've seen a sketch in black and white (In black and white)
I've seen the face you try to hide (try to hide
Behind the doors under the sheets
But you are guilty just like me
And none of us are innocent
A cycle of Russian roulette)

Eyes closed hands tied (Behind our backs we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets and lies
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time)

(Pull up a seat next to me and lets face the jury
Our only chance to come clean so what's it going to be?)

I've seen a sketch in black and white
I've seen the face you try to hide

Eyes closed hands tied (Behind our backs we try)
To cover up (Our deepest secrets and lies
But we both know we are suspects to the crime
And running won't solve our problems this time)

(I've seen a sketch in black and white
I've seen the face you try to hide
Behind the doors under the sheets
But you are guilty just like me
Should we expect no consequence
Maybe our lies will pass the test
And none of us are innocent
A cycle of Russian roulette)
