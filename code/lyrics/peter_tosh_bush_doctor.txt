Warning!
Warning! The Surgeon General warns
Cigarette smoking is dangerous, dangerous
Hazard to your health
Does that mean anything to you
To legalize marijuana
Right here in Jamaica
I'm say it cure glaucoma
I man a de Bush Doctor
So there'll be
No more smokin and feelin tense
When I see them a come
I don't have to jump no fence
Legalize marijuana
Down here in Jamaica
Only cure for asthma
I man a de Minister(of the Herb)
So there'll be no more
Police brutality
No more disrespect
For humanity
Legalize marijuana
Down here in Jamaica
It can build up your failing economy
Eliminate the slavish mentality
There'll be no more
Illegal humiliation
And no more police
Interrogation
Legalize marijuana
Down here in sweet Jamaica
Only cure for glaucoma
I man a de Bush Doctor
So there be
No more need to smoke and hide
When you know you're takin
Illegal ride
Legalize marijuana
Down here in Jamaica
It the only cure for glaucoma
I man a de Minister
