Song:

Chorus:
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
Every day, every day, every day, every way,
Gonna let my little light shine.
Light that shines is the light of love,
Hides the darkness from above,
Shines on me and it shines on you,
Shows you what the power of love can do.
Shine my light both bright and clear,
Shine my light both far and near,
In every dark corner that I find,
Let my little light shine.
[Chorus:]
Sunday gave me the gift of love,
Monday peace came from above,
Tuesday told me to have more faith,
Wednesday gave me a little more grace,
Thursday told me to watch and pray,
Friday told me just what to say and
Saturday gave me the power divine
Just to let my little light shine.
(Chorus twice)
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine.
