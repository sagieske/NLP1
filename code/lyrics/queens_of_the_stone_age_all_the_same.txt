Song:

I saw you in a way
But that's another life
Maybe they're the same
I wonder where you are
Yesterday is gone
But it ain't far away
I guess it's far enough

I'm older in my head
My innocents is gone
I have the book you read
To help me carry on
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
I was blind when he said

It's all the same
No matter where you are x3
He said
But he was wrong

I'm your jezebel
On my way to hell
What a price to pay
To feel like you're alive
She was blind
When she said

It's all the same
No matter where you are x3
She said
But she was wrong
