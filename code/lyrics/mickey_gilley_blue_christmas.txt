Song:

I'll have a blue, blue Christmas without you, 
I'll be so blue thinking about you.
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
They won't mean a thing dear
If you're not here with me.

I'll have a blue, blue Christmas, that's certain, 
And when that blue, blue heartache starts hurting, 
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white, 
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas.

(All right guys let's play some blues Instrumental)

I'll have a blue, blue Christmas, that's certain, 
And when that blue, blue heartache starts hurting, 
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white, 
I'll have, have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.

(Okay Santa let's take it home Instrumental)

I'll have a blue, blue Christmas...
