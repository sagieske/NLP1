Song:

My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free from captivity
My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free

Shiloh:

Why is it so hard for us
We find it hard to trust
The system is so unkind
Always subjecting what is mine

Gentleman:

No colonial mind - no mankind
Don't want to be led by the blind
Tell dem fi go seek and find
We will rise and shine before we run outta time
We hear bout dem world order and dem bombing
Wonder who can take it and stand up inna di famine
What the united nations and world police planning
Cause ritheous people dem keep banning

My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set the captivity free
My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free

Right now you betta know
That love it a the order
No bad mind cross over the border
Wickedness so narrow righteousness much broader
So tell me wha you rellae rather
Da one ya hotta the ten fire side and ten lava
No babylon ship can come dock up inna we harbour
And then we know seh Jah would neva let we starve ya
Hungry cook up banana and some greater casava

My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free
My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free from captivity

No colonial mind - no mankind
Don't want to be led by the blind
Tell dem for go seek and find
We will rise and shine before we run outta time

Shiloh:

There's no need for segregation
Let us all uplift the nation
I know and you know that Jah is for everyone

Gentleman:

Tell me where is the love that Jah Jah has granted
For so long you've been taking advantage
Never will you have Jah Jah children a ramp with
We bun down your killing spree and bun down your rampage

My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free from captivity
My eyes behold the blessings of Jah
I've told the message oh Jah
To set Jah children free
