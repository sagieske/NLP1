Song:

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you

It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

Hey, that sounds like fun
Can I try with you, Larry?
It's built for two, you know
Sure

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you

It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

Oh, that Daisy, I remember Daisy finally
The first time I saw her
She was in a big field full of roses, just roses and Daisy

Did you pick her? Yeah, I picked her
'Cause it's a lot easier to pick a Daisy than it is to pick a rose

Did you ever pick your nose? No
Me neither
Did you buy [Incomprehensible]? Yeah

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you

It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
But you'll look sweet upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

Hey, look over there everyone, it's a train
Oh, I love trains, someday I'm gonna be an engineer
So that I can blow that whistle
Yeah, and where the heck? I don't know
It wouldn't be fun to be aboard all the time

What are you talking about?
I've seen it in the movies
Train engineers look at their watches
And then they stick their head out of the windows
And yell, "I'm aboard", it happens all the time
Oh Larry, that's "All aboard", oh
