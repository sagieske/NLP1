Song:

I want a feast
I want a bean feast
Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts so good you could go nuts.
No, now! 
I want a ball
I want a party
Pink macaroons and a million balloons and performing baboons and
Give it to me now.
I want the world, 
I want the whole world.
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me now! 
I want today
I want tomorrow
I want to wear them like braids in my hair and I don't want to share them
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter
Ten thousand tons of ice cream
And if I don't get the things I am after
I'm going to scream! 
I want the works, 
I want the whole works! 
Presents and prizes and sweets and surprises in all shapes and sizes, 
And now! 
Don't care how I want it now! 
Don't care how I want it now!
