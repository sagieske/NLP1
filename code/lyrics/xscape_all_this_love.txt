Song:

[Verse One (Latocha):]
I had some problems,
And no-one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer,
You told me to take this chance,
And learn the ways of love, my baby,
And all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

[Verse Two (Tiny):]
You say that you love me,
Said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so amazing,
That I gave it half a chance,
And learnt the ways of love,
And there's so much love inside me.
And all that I have I give my all to you,
All my loving.

[Chorus:]
All this love is waiting for you
[Repeat]

[Verse Three (Latocha):]
I had some problems,
And no-one could seem to solve them.
But you you you found the answer,
So I gave it half a chance,
And learnt the ways of love, my baby,
And all that it has to offer.
And all that I have I give my love to you,
All my loving.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Musical interlude]

[Repeat Chorus twice]

[Break:]
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me darlin',
Cause I really love you baby,
Cause I really love darlin'.
[Repeat to fade]
