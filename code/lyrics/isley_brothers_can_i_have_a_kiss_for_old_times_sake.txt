Song:

Oh oh, mmm-mmm
Do do doo oh oh
Start off with a hug
Lead into embrace
Oh, girl, I'm glad to see you
Oh, face-to-face
Not a day of age
Oh, and by the way
I forgot to say
How much I missed you, baby
And just like deja vu, I say
Running into you this way
I want to keep you here
I got to have you near
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
For old times' sake (oh baby)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
For old times' sake(oh, oh)
It's been a long time
Since I've called you mine
Sure would like to see us
Back together like we used to be
So let me take you out
So much to talk about
Like things we used to share
And how to get it back my dear
Just like deja vu, I say
Running into you this way
I want to keep you here
I got to have you near
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
For old times' sake (oh baby)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
Can I have a kiss from you (Can I have a kiss from you)
For old times' sake(oh, oh)
Oh yeah well yeah well well
Well well well can I can I can I can I
No no no no no
Can I have a kiss baby
I need it oh want it
And just like deja vu, I say
Running into you this way
I want to keep you here
I got to have you near
