Song:

If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this.
Remind me that, once I was free,
Once I was clear, once I was me.

And if I sit down, and cross my arms,
Hold me to, this song.

Knock me out, smash out my brains,
If I take a chair, start to talk s**t.....

If I get old, remind me of this:
That night we kissed, that I really meant it.

Whatever happens, if we're still speaking.
Pick up the phone, play me this song
