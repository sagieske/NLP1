Song:

If the feeling is gone
Please don't pretend that you still love me
I can see it in your eyes
And it hurts to admit it
I can't tell that the feeling is gone

All I ask is just a little honestly
Though I know that you're not coming back to me
You know I'll do anything to make you stay
But I just have to let you go
If the feeling is gone

There is sadness in your smile
Though you try to conceal it
I can't tell if the feeling is gone

All I ask is just a little honestly
Though I know that you're not coming back to me
You know I'll do anything to make you stay
But I just have to let you go
If the feeling is gone

All I ask is just a little honestly
Though I know that you're not coming back to me
You know I'll do anything to make you stay
But I just have to let you go
I just have to let you go
I just have to let you go

If the feeling is gone...
