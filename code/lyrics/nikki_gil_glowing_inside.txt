Song:

Happy, to let you know
You make me glow
I feel so good, it's true
So glad that I have you
You love me so
Now all is bright

I'll always thank you for the glow
And thank you for the joy
Thank you for the love you give to me
I'm glowing, glowing inside
With your love shining through
Thank you for everything you do
I'm glowing inside because of you

Remember, my growing years
They're filled with joy
Because you're there for me
You cast my fears away
You wipe those tears
You gave me strength each day

I thank you for the glow
And thank you for the joy
Thank you for the love you give to me
I'm glowing, glowing inside
With your love shining through
Thank you for everything you do
I'm glowing inside because of you

Who knows of what tomorrow brings
My glowing wings can make me fly
I'll reach and now I touch the sky
Because of you I'll sore up high
So I must

Thank you for the glow
And thank you for the joy
Thank you for the love you give to me
I'm glowing, glowing inside
With your love shining through
Thank you for everything you do
I'm glowing inside because of you
