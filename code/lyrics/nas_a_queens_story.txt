Song:

Wave to the side of his dome, definition of good? Yo
Gangstas don't die, n****s only become immortal
Angels no longer fly, they walk right before you
In front of you, it's foul what this honey could do
Cats corrupt, so loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fu***n' truth
There was Stress from my squad
I could've died the same night that Stress died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off then drove to Springfield
November 30th another Queens king killed
It f****d me up y'all
I was just tryin' to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days they was sleepin' on us
Brooklyn keep on takin' it, Manhattan keep on makin' it
