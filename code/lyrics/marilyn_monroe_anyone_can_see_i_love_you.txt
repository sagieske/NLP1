Song:

Anyone can see I love you,
Anyone can see I care,
The way I hold your hand,
And smile in your direction,
Tells the world my heart is filled with
Nothing but affection.

Lock me in your arms forever,
That's the place I want to be,
So anyone can see,
That I belong to you,
And you belong to me.

(Music break)

Lock me in your arms forever,
That's the place I want to be,
So anyone can see,
That I belong to you,
And you belong to me.
