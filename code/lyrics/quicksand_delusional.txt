Song:

Delusional,
I'm not impressed.
You want to, tell me, so bad,
Who is on your guest list, tonight,
But I don't care.
Save it for,
One of your,
Other friends,
Or your many fans.
Just think.
Just,
Think solutional,
We have a problem.
We don't care, who you know.
Its too bad that you think so.
Next time you drop a name.
Save it for,
One of your,
Other friends,
Or your many fans.
Delusional,
I'm not impressed.
Illusional,
Lies, you tell best,
And you want me to know,
But I can't hear at all.
But I can't hear at all.
I can't hear at all.
But I can't hear at all.
I can't hear at all
