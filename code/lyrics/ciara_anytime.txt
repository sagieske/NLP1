Song:

[Future]
I'll be there anytime
[Ciara]
Baby I'll go to war

[Chorus:]
(Baby I)
Baby I'll go to war for you (in this life)
Baby I'll get the scars to prove (I'll be there anytime)

[Future]
Anytime that you need
Anytime that you call
Anytime that you fall
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Future]
Anytime that you hurt
Anytime you're in pain
Baby call my name
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Verse]
Damn, running with romance
And now my heart is beating so fast
And I've been dreaming 'bout this feeling for so long
Man, ever since you came in my life, my stars aligned, you spent the time
It feels so right, I know this can't be wrong

I cry happy, happy tears every night
Imma spend the rest of my life
Just lovin' on you, kissing' on you, being on you,
Holding on you, touching on you, leaning on you

[Chorus:]
(Baby I)
Baby I'll go to war for you (in this life)
Baby I'll get the scars to prove (I'll be there anytime)

[Future]
Anytime that you need
Anytime that you call
Anytime that you fall
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Future]
Anytime that you hurt
Anytime you're in pain
Baby call my name

[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Verse 2:]
[Future]
I'm your soldier, I'm your soldier
I'll go to war because I love ya
[Ciara]
You're my soldier, you're my soldier
I'll wait for you, cause I love ya
[Future]
I'm your soldier, I'm your soldier
I'll go to war because I love ya

[Future]
Hit me, I come in no time
I get right on the front line
We the new Bonnie & Clyde
Yeah

[Chorus:]
(Baby I)
Baby I'll go to war for you (in this life)
Baby I'll get the scars to prove (I'll be there anytime)

[Future]
Anytime that you need
Anytime that you call
Anytime that you fall
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Future]
Anytime that you hurt
Anytime you're in pain
Baby call my name
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Bridge:]
You're my baby
And I adore you
I love my baby
You know I'll always be here for you

You're my baby
And I adore you
I love my baby
You know I'll always be here for you

[Chorus:]
(Baby I)
Baby I'll go to war for you (in this life)
Baby I'll get the scars to prove (I'll be there anytime)

[Future]
Anytime that you need
Anytime that you call
Anytime that you fall
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime

[Future]
Anytime that you hurt
Anytime you're in pain
Baby call my name
[Future + Ciara]
I'll be there anytime
