Feat. Toni Gonzaga

[Piolo]
Once in a lifetime the chance will come
Seeing that someone you recognize,
And you will know deep in their eyes,
A love that has waited sailing through time

[Toni]
There are no perfect strangers,
Just what's meant to be?
Memories through the ages,
We've got a faith that's strong enough
Nothing can compare to our love
Reaching our eternally

[Toni & Piolo]
If only love can make a place for us
A time for us to share
Strong enough to show how much
Show how much we really care,
If it takes us halfway there and back again,
[Piolo]
Then that's enough
[Toni
Enough for us
[Toni & Piolo]
If only love

[Piolo] Once in a lifetime that bells will chime
And angels start singing cause heavens bringing
With you and me together again
Eternally, [Toni & Piolo] we'll be remembering

[Toni]
There are no perfect strangers
[Piolo]
No perfect strangers
[Toni & Piolo]
Just what's meant to be
[Toni]
Memories through the ages
We've got a faith that's strong enough
Nothing can compare to our love
Reaching our eternally

[Toni & Piolo]
If only love can make a place for us
A time for us to share
Strong enough to show how much
Show how much we really care
If it takes us halfway there and back again
[Piolo]
Then that's enough
[Toni]
Enough for us
If only love
[Toni & Piolo]
If only love ooh

[Piolo]
You know that everybody sees
We were meant to be
Close together in this world
[Toni]
It's more than just a touch
It's more than good enough
[Toni & Piolo]
It's more than you and me

[Toni & Piolo]
If only love can make a place for us
[Toni]
And a time for us to share
Strong enough to show how much
[Toni & Piolo]
Show how much we really care
If it takes us halfway there and back again
[Piolo]
Then that's enough
[Toni]
Enough for us
[Toni & Piolo]
If only love

[Piolo]
Then that's enough
[Toni]
Enough for us
[Toni & Piolo]
If only love
