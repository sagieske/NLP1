Song:

I've been living in this town, for quite sometime
It's been eighteen years since I crossed that county line
I sold almost everything that was mine
Now I'm leaving town, with nothing but that bottom line

A hundred dollars and a half of a tank of gas
The shirt that's on my back, and an beat up Rangers cap
200 miles to go, who would believe that,
I would go this far, without turning back

Chorus:
So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

The bands been on the road now, for quite sometime
Hitting all the cities, neon sign to neon sign
Drowning in straight bourbon whiskey, beer and too much wine
Playing our songs for nothing but that bottom line

But on that stage each night, were captured by the sound
Singing these songs we write, to a different town
'Cause there are people who believe in what we've found
They like the song we sing and that's why we hang around

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

Thirty Years from now on that marquee sign
You'll see our name lit up misspelled, and live tonight
But we don't care, cause we play music that we like
Almost for free, for nothing but that bottom line

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line

So Here I go, packing light to head down that road
And I know, this life I'll lead will beat on my soul
But I'll still have my pride
Nothing But That Bottom Line
