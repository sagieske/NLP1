Song:

Music is life, life, life, life
Come again

Elephant.
Holla at me hater, I'ma holla back
See me cut a dread in a disco track
Beer's on ice, soon as I'm home
Roll up a shrink now my beer is cold
I put my headphone on
Man gon' plug in and soon I'ma zone
I'ma groovin
Gotta keep groovin' Gotta groove for life
Rhythm is me window, it's me hope, it's me life.
I gotta stay true yo, visitors free
I better hold on now, this time is me
And my man Ras G. If he cook a rock, serve a melody.

[Chorus:]
Hey yo, oh, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo, this type of music, keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life

Another day another dollar said
Waking up, waking out, wanna fly away
Who are you baby, I never saw you, bro.
You're like a brush in my eyes
N-n-now Ras
Good vibes the people them want
Play the music ah tell me of Jah
From Jamaica, to Sweden, to France
People all jump and prance
It's source of life, take heed from the word of the wise
When I'm down and out and I need some strength, music can keep me alive.

[Chorus:]
Hey yo, oh, gotta keep movin' and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo, this type of music, keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life

Feel no pain,
Blood run through my veins
Feel so good, in my neighborhood
Breathe in, breathe out and feel the love g
You may be poor but music is free
A shitty day, but then you press play
Music will take you away

[Chorus:]
Hey yo, oh, gotta keep movin', and groovin'
For life, for life
Hey yo, this type of music, keep me groovin'
For life, for life
Music is life
