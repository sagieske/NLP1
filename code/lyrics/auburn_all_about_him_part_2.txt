Song:

Ah, Romeo and Juliette, real love, real thangs, pushing that
You about to get something that you won't regret
And this gonna be the bound, this is what I bet, yeah, ah
Girl stop playing with me, I've been waiting all day like the tank empty
I need love, she said give it to me, never triple hating been this cause she's all about

Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,
Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,

Well, had him shooting for me like a ball team
Every guy was a knockout, don king
But none of them had smarts, that's my thing
It's not enough to have balls, Spalding
One day by the stop bus, I bump in to a guy rocking black chucks
He said, excuse me beautiful, I said, aw shucks and then he asked hey you wanna grab lunch?

Never ever met a guy so fly, got me hoked like an apple pie
I think I'm falling but I don't know why, but I won't fight these butterflies

Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,
Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody, we don't give a damn

And I swear what we have is just super cool
The way he's always in my head like a blue tooth
I got a text from him, he said come through, told me that he wants to kick it, kung fu
Don't do nothing much at all, just we and his boys watching football
He asked for kiss, and so I gave him two, he said thank well thank you baby
I said you're welcome boo

Never ever met a guy so fly, got me hooked like an apple pie
I think I'm falling and I don't know why, but I won't fight these butterflies

Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,
Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,

I don't need no fancy cars and I don't need no diamond rings
My baby is all I need and more, cause I don't need those extra things
It's not about you, it's not about you, it's not about them, it's not about them
It's all about me, and it's all about him

Ah, never make a jump with your eyes closed
Face first until you're other soul
Feeling like I'm racing on a bumpy road
I see them stop signs but we're just rushing through
Ah, seeing that I drive you crazy
But I ain't drove a flu like Alladin baby
Magic carpet you could be my Jasmin lady
Take a sip there's a genie in a bottle waiting
Wait, wait, no worry with the haters, saying boomers gonna come, we just barricade them
Forget them out,... Erase them, all day all she say is

Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,
Cause I'm all about him, him, him, him, him
And he's all about me, me, me, me, me
And we don't give a dang dang dang dang dang about nobody,

Cause I'm all about him, cause I'm all about him, all about him, we don't give adang dang dang
It's all about you, it's all about you, boy, it's all about you
