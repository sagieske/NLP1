Song:

There's a girl in the backyard bangin' on her drum
Sittin' in a junk pile laughing at the sun
Singin' "ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"

There's a boy in the backseat singin' to the song
Playin' on the radio, knowing he's the one
Singin' "ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"

Singin' "ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar!"

There's a girl in the tree top looking at the stars
Waiting for a touchdown comin' in from Mars
Thinkin' "is there anybody out there?"

There's a boy thinking of here playin' his guitar
Searching for the answer buried in his heart
Singin' "ah, ha ha, is there anybody out there?"

Singin' "ah, ha ha, is there anybody out there"

If there's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinnin' and I wanna know why

And we're all getting older wishin' we were young
Hangin' on the memory of what we would become
Singin' "ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar"
Singin' "ah ha ha, I just wanna be a rockstar"
Singin' "ah ha ha, I was born to be a rockstar!"

If there's a meaning can you show me a sign
The more I look it just gets harder to find
The world is spinnin' and I wanna know why

And maybe we will never figure it out
I got a feelin' that's what life's all about
I'm learning anything is possible now

Take a ticket and get off the line
