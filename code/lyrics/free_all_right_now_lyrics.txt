Song:

There she stood in the street, smiling from her head to her feet
I said, "A-hey, what is this?"
Now baby maybe, maybe she's in need of a kiss
I said, "A-hey, what's your name, baby?
Maybe we can see things the same
Now don't you wait or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate"
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now

Let me tell you now

I took her home to my place, watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame? "
I said, "Slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last? "
She said, "Love, lord above, now you're gonna trick me in love"
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
Yeah, it's alright now

Let me tell you all about it now

Took her home to my place, watching every move on her face
She said, "Look, what's your game?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame? "
"Baby", I said, "Slow, slow, don't go so fast
Don't you think that love can last? "
She said, "Love, lord above, now you're gonna trick me in love"
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby, it's all right now (Baby)
All right now baby, it's all right now (Baby, baby, baby, it's all right)
All right now baby (All right now), it's all right now (It's all right, it's all right, it's all right)
All right now baby, it's all right now
All right now baby (We're so happy together), it's all right now (It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, everything is all right)
All right now baby, it's all right now
