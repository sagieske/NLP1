Song:

Well I passed you in the doorway
And you took me with a glance
Should have been on that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father's going crazy
Say's I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in the spotlight
It's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

Well it's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
Disobeyed another warning
I should have been home by ten

I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
But it's a habit worth forming
If the means justify the ends

I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in the spotlight
It's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

Dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in the spotlight
It's alright
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
