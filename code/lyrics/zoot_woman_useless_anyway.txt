Song:

Useless anyway
Nothing left to say
All the s**t we start to speak
Stuck in tracks we made too deep

Heads replace the heart
Fate exchanged for luck
Left to wait, not work it out
Acting sane won't calm you down

Useless anyway
Nothing left to say
Now I've lost sympathy
To worthless self pity

Found comfort at the start
Then we watched it fall apart
Losing everything we had
Been complaining for too long

So here we are
Where are we

Questions love don't let it be
Is it you or is it me?
Made excuses made mistakes
Nothing left to contemplate

Forget what you won't forgive
'Cause I can't take it anymore
All that's left just irritates
No, I can't take it anymore

So here we are
Where are we
