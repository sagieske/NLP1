Song:

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas is you

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
There's no sense in hanging stockings
There upon the fireplace
'Cause Santa he won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
Girl, what can I do?
You know that all I want for Christmas is you

And all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really love?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
No, I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own
More that you could ever know
Make my wish come true
You know that all I want for Christmas is you, is you
