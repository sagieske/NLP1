Song:

Listen baby,
I know you scared of you and me
This has gone through many occasions,
And I know you too well.

You've see me in possessions no one ever could imagine.
We been into our song long time now.
Sometimes nature makes me believe she gots to make a decision
For you and for me.
You say I take your breath away,
You make me forget what happened along the way

You pick me up but you put me in
You saw me first when I saw you nowhere
Now I put you first, but you don't see me anyway

So now my heart's takin' in yours too,
But what I understand about love is not just what you do.
Love is not takin' life and happiness,
Love is not negativity and only stress.
Love is letting go, been able to breathe,
Love is 'i Love you', that's the best way it is.

Maybe I'm just too immature
And insecure from all this lovin'.
Let me fall for you, boy, you now
Don't see me anyway.

You pick me up but you put me in
You saw me first when I saw you nowhere
Now I put you first, but you don't see me anyway

Now you find that I'm the one cryin'
Now I made you strong and I'm the one desiring
Now you calling the wound
So sit and done
We'll quit, we'll quit, we'll quit, we quit
We finish, we quit! Yeah.
