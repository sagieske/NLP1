Song:

I lit a match in Vienna tonight,
It caused a fire in New York.
Where is my self-control?

You gotta learn to be thankful,
For the things that you have.
Now bathe my idle soul in

Desire,
Desire,
Desire,
Desire.

Taken by force,
Twisted fate,
Well, what weighs more,
Down on your plate.

A ton of love,
A ton of hate,
We’re waiting for,
A chance of, a chance of, a chance of,

Desire,
Desire,
Desire,
Desire.

I don’t trust the government,
I don’t trust myself,
What is a boy gonna do?

Build a church in the city,
A place to crawl with our own,
We'll give our God away.

Taken by force,
Twisted fate,
Well, what weighs more,
Down on your plate.

A ton of love,
A ton of hate,
We’re waiting for,
A chance of, a chance of, a chance of,

Desire,
Desire,
Desire,
Desire, desire.

Desire,
Desire,
Desire,
Desire.

Taken by force,
Twisted fate,
Well, what weighs more,
Down on your plate.

A ton of love,
A ton of hate,
We’re waiting for,
A chance of, a chance of, a chance of.
