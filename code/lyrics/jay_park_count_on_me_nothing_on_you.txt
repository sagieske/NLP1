Song:

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Wi-heom-haett-deon-geon

Neo-eui ib-sul-bo-da deon
Neo-eui sa-rang-i-eott-ji

Geu-ge mo-deun-geol ba-ggweott-ji
Geu-reo-ni-gga Love peace with you

(Da-shi love peace with U)
Geu-reo-ni-gga Love peace with you

So am I
Na wi-ro-haett-ji neol
A-ni wi-ro-bad-ji na
Balk-eun haet-bit neo-eui nun-bit ga-seum-ddwi-ge hae-jweott-ji
I-je-bu-teo Love peace with you
(Da-shi Love peace with U)
I-je-bu-teo Love peace with you

They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Neon jeong-mal ye-bbun mam-gge-ji gip-eun
