Song:

We float before the sea and eyes
Getting heavy mixing glitter thighs
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do

We sip the wind through lips alive
And added cones won't whistle lone
I smile because I won't do
I smile because you won't do

Put flowers in your hand
Wrap pretend around my chest
I smile because I won't do
I am your bore

Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war

Down by the shore a funny foe
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
He left before I come through
You left before I come through

We took the heals into trees
I hid my hand and bit the leaves
He left before I come through
You left before I

Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war

Drinks are stale, fell through the beat
Wrapped in life and ultra-green
Ooze teamed with tiny feet
And world of tied up memories

You left before I got to you
You left before I got to you
You left before I
You left before I

Took the flowers from your hand
Bowed to me and kissed my hand
Did before I, did before I

Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war

Sink my little soul for you
And talking
I said I've been through a lot of noise
The manner that he drinks in twos, enjoys
We're utterly agreed in which to war

I smile because I won't do
