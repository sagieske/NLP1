Song:

Nicely, nicely, I got the horse right here
The name is Paul Revere
And here's a guy that says if the weather's clear
Can do, can do

This guys says the horse can do
If he says the horse can do
Can do, can do, can do
Can do, can do

This guy says the horse can do
If he says the horse can do
Can do, can do

For Paul Revere I'll bite
I hear his foot's all right
Of course it all depends if it rained last night
Likes mud, likes mud

This X means the horse likes mud
If that means the horse likes mud
Likes mud, likes mud

I'll tell you Paul Revere, ow this is no bum steer
It's from a handicapper that's real sincere
This guy says the horse shows class can do, can do
Paul Revere, I got the horse right here

Benny, I'm picking Valentine
'Cause on the morning line
This guy has got him figured at five to nine
Has chance, has chance

This guy says the horse has chance
If he says the horse has chance
Has chance, has chance

I know it's Valentine
The morning works looks fine
Besides the Jockey's brother's a friend of mine
Needs race, needs race

My friend says the horse needs race
If he says the horse needs race
Needs race, needs race

I go for Valentine 'cause on the morning line
The guy has got him figured at five to nine, has chance, has chance
This guy says the horse has chance
Valentine, I got the horse right here

Rusty, but look at epitaph
He wins it by a half
According to this here in the Telegraph
Big threat, big threat

This guy calls the horse big threat
If he calls the horse big threat
Big threat, big threat

And just a minute boys
I've got the feed box noise
It says the great grandfather was Equipoise
Shows class, shows class

This guy says the horse shows class
If he says the horse shows class
Shows class, shows class

So make it epitaph
He wins it by a half
According to this here in the Telegraph
Epitaph, I got the horse right here
