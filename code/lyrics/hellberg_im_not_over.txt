Song:

Rock me like an earthquake
Tell me I'm falling
Hit me like a tidal wave
I never saw it coming

Cause nothings ever what its sound
Took too much to fight
No wonder who crashed
And you threw all the points away
You left me searching

I'm not over
Why you down baby breaking my heart
I'm not over
I'm not gonna let us fall apart
I'm not over
I'm not over
I'm not over

Milk me like a milky way
Like I'm leaving tomorrow
Shoot me like a shooting star
As fast as the Apollo

'Cause nothings ever what its sound
Took too much to fight
No wonder who crashed
And you threw all the points away
You left me searching

I'm not over
Why you down baby breaking my heart
I'm not over
I'm not gonna let us fall apart
I'm not awake
I'm not over
