Song:

Adrenalize me

Come a little bit closer
Before we begin
Lemme tell you how I want it
And exactly what I need
I'm here for one drug
I'm only here for one thing
So come on and tell me,
Can you fly like you're free?
Cause I need to feel
Yeah, I need to say...

I must confess,
I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss
Straight through my chest
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and s**
Adrenalize me

I crave excess,
Turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and s**

Get a little bit higher,
So we can fall til we bleed
Push a little bit harder
Pull me into the speed
So tell me, can you feel this?
Come into my dream
Are you ready to awaken?
Are you ready to feed?
Cause I need to feel,
Yeah, I need to say...

I must confess,
I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss
Straight through my chest
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and s**
Adrenalize me

I crave excess,
Turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and s**

We have to live before we die
We were born to live before we die
Don't you wanna live before you die?
Let me see you live before you die!

Right here, right now... Adrenalize me
Right here, right now... Adrenalize me
Right here, right now... Adrenalize me
Right here, right now... I'm addicted to this

I must confess,
I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss
Straight through my chest
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Music, love and s**
Adrenalize me

I crave excess,
Turning wine into sweat
Dripping down my neck
I can't deny, I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and s**

Adrenalize me
