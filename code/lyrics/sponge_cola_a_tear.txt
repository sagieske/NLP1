Song:

How is life on the other side
How is it like to be without the without the
Usual
Typical
Illusional
Difficult
Me
How is life on the other side
I'm not even sure if I still remember how you
Did you change at all
Did you cut your hair
Are you still in touch with that
Old perfume you used to wear
Life the usual
Typical
Illusional
Difficult
You just you
Speak to me
I don't know what to expect
Speak to me
Alone and out of breathe
Speak to me
I don't have anything left
Speak to me
Oh speak to me
I wish I could tell you how I've been
I wish I could tell you everything
Everything
Do you even know what you're fighting for
Coz I can't remember
I can't see it anymore
Pretending I'm fine
I'm happy can't you see
Who gives a fun about HTML
You're lying through your teeth
Why wont we
Comeback
Why wont we
Comeback
