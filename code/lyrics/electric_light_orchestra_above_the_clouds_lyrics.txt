Song:

Oh in the heat of the night
Well when things ain't going right
No no no no no no, you were in memory

I came along to see your face
But the only thing I got from you
Was telling me it's fantasy
That you would always be with me
I can tell you that it's true
(I can tell you that it's true)
(Well yes it's true)

I'm waiting here
But it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
But it's alright with me
You better believe me now

I guess it's like a mountain side
You gotta climb it to the top
Floating in the sea of dreams
The only thing that you can see
Is the view above the clouds
(Is the view above the clouds)
(Above the clouds)

I'm waiting here
But it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Still it's alright with me
You better believe me now
