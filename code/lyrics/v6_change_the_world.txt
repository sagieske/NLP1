Song:

I want to change the world,
Keep on holding on your desire,
You will get a shining love,
That you can reach alone
If you go on to get your goal,
It's wonderland.

I felt so worried when I spent all the time
Thinking of the future of us
'Cause I know, there's nothing
That I really want to know.
And then I met you, so I could feel,
What you should know:
I've finally found your love,
And now I'm really feeling all right,
'Cause the nightmare has gone,
This is the way to love you.

I want to change the world,
Walk again never miss the way,
Don't be afraid I'm with you,
And we can fly away,
If you can stay with me forever,
Change my mind,
Won't get lost if your passion's true,
I'm gonna fly with you again,
So you can spread your wings,
And you will fly with me away,
It's wonderland.

We gotta swim against the tide and the flow
Till the day when we'll get your goal
You will see that your desire
Will be granted again

This is the feeling you'll understand
The troubled life....
It won't be too bad to face
And any problem you will see
Will not to be too hard
If I can walk beside you

I want to change the world
Walk again, fight against the wind
Donï¿½ t be afraid to be true
'Cause now you have to bring
The power of your smile on your face
Change my mind
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get a shining love
That you can reach alone
If you go on to get your goal
It's wonderland.

I want to change the world,
Walk again never miss the way,
Don't be afraid I'm with you,
And we can fly away,
If you can stay with me forever,
Change my mind,
Won't get lost if your passion's true,
I'm gonna fly with you again,
So you can spread your wings,
And you will fly with me away,
It's wonderland.
