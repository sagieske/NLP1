Song:

They gave their selves to the streets, they saved.
They took the challenge to keep our faith.
We can't imagine the way. We can't imagine the day.
They put their hate in the waves, they put their heart in the way.
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved. They fought to keep our
Faith.
Cut their life away from safe, to save. Leave the blind alone in the reign.
But I know I couldn't be taught to die with pride, for queen or country.
I know I couldn't be taught to die, not another slave to the hive.
I've seen the names, I'm not young and afraid, the numbers the same.
They could decide when we die but we decide what we defend.
We sing the sorrow of the dead from our souls. And hope that they found
Peace, dying alone.
Out their life away from safe, to save.
The mindless freedom puts our nation to shame. Are you grateful of the
Graves?
I speak the words of a weathered man, there's blood on the streets that my
Son walks down.
If we suffered for this, I has to change.
They gave their selves to the streets, they saved. They took the challenge
To keep our faith.
