Song:

[Verse:]
Better than words
But more than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling
Everytime we touch
I'm all shook up
You make me wanna *sigh*
How deep is your love?
God only knows, baby

[Chorus:]
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words (better than words)
Better than words

[Verse 2:]
You drive me crazy
Someone like you
Always be my baby
Best I ever had
Hips don't lie
You make me wanna *uff*
One more night
Irreplaceable, yeah
Crazy, we're crazy

[Chorus:]
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
I can't explain your love, no

[Bridge:]
Every one tries (they try)
To see what it feels like
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better

One more time...
Better than words... Yeah

[Chorus:]
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way I can explain your love, no
Ooh, I don't know how else to sum it up,
'Cause words ain't good enough
I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words
It's better than words
