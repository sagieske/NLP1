Song:

Don't say "I'm sorry" again
It doesn't give you the right
To be someone else
I would be pleased to love and share
But inside I'm locked
I can't even cry

Love only matters
When it comes to the end
Love only matters
Makes you rise again

I'm just an ornament
An ornament to your face
Not enough but it feels right
You keep me alive
When you hold me tight

Both ends are burning fast
Would you stand by me
When things are getting bad
And the colours here will fade
Would you help me see
Real shades of grey

Love only matters
When it comes to the end
Love only matters
Makes me rise again

I'm just an ornament
An ornament to your face
Not enough but it feels right
You keep me alive
When you hold me tight

I'm just an ornament
An ornament in your garden
Not enough but it feels right
You keep me alive
When you bring the rain, rain, rain

Read between the lines
This is fragile only for you and I
All I want is that you love me
As I am

Don't say "I'm sorry" again
Does it give you the right
To be someone else
Someone else
Someone else
