Song:

I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy.

Well, a poor boy's chances for a pretty girl's glances
Are sometimes very few
Though you got no money I'll be your honey
If you swear that you'll be true.

I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy.

--- Instrumental ---

We met by chance and I knew at a glance
That I'd found my destiny
Now I wanna carry you off and marry you
If you will agree.

I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy...
