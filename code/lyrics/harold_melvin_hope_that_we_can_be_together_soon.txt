Song:

When I'm away from you, boy
All I seem to do is cry
And then when I see you, boy
My, how the time does fly
I don't know if you need and love me
The way I love and need you

I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
I hope that we can be together soon
Can you make it real soon
Can you make it real soon

When I think about you, girl
Chills run up and down my spine
And if my wish would come true, oh baby
I'd be with you all the time
Wrong or right, day or night I sure do miss you
All my lonely heart seems to do

I hope that we can be together soon
(can we make real soon)
I hope that we can be together soon
(Maybe tomorrow)
I feel that we can be together soon
But will you make it real soon
(I can't wait no longer)
Can you make it real soon
(I can't wait)

I hope that we can be together
I swear I can't wait any longer
Every day my love grows stronger
Ooh, baby
And I, I'd like to....
