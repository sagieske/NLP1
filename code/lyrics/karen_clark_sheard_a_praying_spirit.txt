Song:

Lord, give me a praying spirit
A praying spirit
Lord, help me to say yes
Yes, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord

A praying spirit throughout the day
Praying spirit in every, every, every way
Praying spirit, so that I might stay
Lord, I want a praying spirit, lest I pray, oh Lord

Lord, give me a praying spirit
A praying spirit
Lord, help me to say yes
Yes, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord

Lord, when I pray, give me what to say
Lord, when I pray, give me what to say
Lord, when I pray, give me what to say

Lord, when I pray, give me what to say
Lord, when I pray, give me what to say
Lord, when I pray, give me what to say

And I want to say yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes Lord
Yes, yes, yes, yes Lord
Yes, yes, yes, yes Lord
Yes, yes, yes, yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord
