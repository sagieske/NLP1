Song:

Dear citizens of the New Fallout,
For too long, our society has succumbed to the tyranny of our own actions.
Wars, riots, we have tolerated the scum and have graciously cleaned up the mess.
Well, no more.
You have all been a consequence of the disease known as freedom,
And now it is time to take that freedom away.
As of today, you will be stripped of your identity,
And anything you hold dear in life.
For it is your individuality that has led to your destruction.
Your children will be left to rot as punishment for your indiscretion,
And the lives you have lived until now will be nothing but a memory.
This is for the survival of the race,
This is for the New Fallout,
This is the end.

In the darkest night, the faintest light is blinding.
In the darkest night, the faintest light is blinding.

For my fallen stars,
Banner men, ready for your call to arms.
And for my broken hearts,
It's time to take back what we thought we lost.

For my fallen stars,
Banner men, ready for your call to arms.
And for my broken hearts,
It's time to take back what we thought we lost!

This is the resistance!
It's a call to arms!
The anthem for all those who don't belong.
We're here to take our stand!

This is the resistance!
It's been far too long.
That we've put all our faith into the corrupt.
It's time to start the end!
