Song:

Dance, it's all I wanna do, so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you why won't you move?
I'll get inside your groove, cause I'm on fire, fire, fire, fire!

It hurts, when you get to close, but baby it hurts!
If love is really good you just want more,
Even if it throws you too the fire, fire, fire, fire!

All The Lovers, that have gone before, they don't compare... To you!
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more.
They don't compare... All The Lovers!

Feel, can't you see there's so much here to feel?
Deep inside your heart you know I'm real.
Can't you see that this is getting higher, higher, higher, higher?

Breathe, I know you find it hard but baby breathe.
You'll be next to me, it's all you need.
And I'll take you there, I'll take you higher, higher, higher higher!

All The Lovers, that have gone before, they don't compare... To you!
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more.
They don't compare... All The Lovers!

Dance... It's all I wanna do so won't you dance?
I'm standing here with you, why won't you move?
Even if it throws you to the fire, fire, fire, fire!

All The Lovers, that have gone before, they don't compare... To you!
Don't be frightened, just give me a little bit more.
They don't compare... All The Lovers!
