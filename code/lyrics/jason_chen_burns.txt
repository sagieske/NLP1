Song:

You left me on the porch, with a rose in my hand.
How could you be so cold?
How could you make the door slam?

I can deal with a lie of pain,
But this I don't know.
It's like another level I have
Never dealt before.

If I ever fall in love again, (yeaaah)
Will I ever be the same again? (nooo)
Cause I lost what I had,
And I'll never get it back
No matter what I try to do.

Cause every time I think about you,
I think about pain.
I remember every single word you say.
Like deja vu,
You say we're through.
And now that's all I think about When I think about you.

And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.
And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.

I've some a long way, But then I see you again.
I can't belive you say, That you still want to be friends.

I guess you moved on, I wish that I'd done the same.
But I'm still black and blue.
Just can't forget that day.

If I ever fall in love again, (yeaaah)
Will I ever be the same again? (nooo)
Cause I lost what I had,
And I'll never get it back
No matter what I try to do.

Cause every time I think about you,
I think about pain.
I remember every single word you say.
Like deja vu,
You say we're through.
And now that's all I think about When I think about you.

And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.
And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.

To many times that I've tried to forget your name.
But I still feel the same.
How long will I have to wait till I feel okay.

Cause every time I think about you,
I think about pain.
I remember every single word you say.
Like deja vu,
You say we're through.
And now that's all I think about When I think about you.

And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.
And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.
And it burns, And it burns, And it burns.

Burns. Yeah it burns. Oh it burns.
