Song:

I would search this world for you
Even though you can't imagine
I wanna take you to China
I wanna kiss you in Rome
I use rocket ships
And mine sweepers
Transistor radio receivers
I wanna hold you
Wanna hold you too tight
Gonna break every bone
Of everybody in sight
When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a bird in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down
Down down down
I hear your talking and whispers
Pale drawn out nails and fingers
I'm seeing shapes behind the curtains
You're looking older
But you can't be certain
You're so tired but you just can't sleep
You're so shallow but you're in too deep
Your hands shaking, body splitting
Bodies mine
I know, I know, 'cause I told you so
When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a plane in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down
Down down down
You're dragging me down
You're dragging me down
Dra-dra-dragging me down
You're dragging me down
You're dragging me, dragging me, dragging me
You're dragging me down
I never can quite remember
Was it June, July or September
That you sold your soul to me, to me
That you sold your soul to me, to me
When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a star in the sky
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
But you're dragging me down, yeah
When I'm flying so high
(Flying so high)
Like a star in the sky
But you're dragging me down
But you're dragging me down
But you're dragging me down
Down down down
Dragging me down [x9]
