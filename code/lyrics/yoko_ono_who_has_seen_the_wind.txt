Original lyrics by christina rossetti (1830 - 1894)

Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor i.
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by.

Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor i.
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by.

Oh, wind, wind,
Wind, wind, wind.

Who has seen enough?
Only me and john.
But when a smile goes round the world
Our love is catching on.

Oh, smile, smile,
Smile, smile, smile.

Who has seen your dream?
Only you and him.
But when the world gets bright and clear
You know that we were there.

Oh, world, world,
World, world, world.
