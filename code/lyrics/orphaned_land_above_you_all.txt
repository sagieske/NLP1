Song:

I stand above you now
Slowly taking your soul
The god of gods, the corruptor
I stand above you all

Hear my never-ending lie

Ride the wind
Control your life
Bringing swiftly
The lord demise

I fight against all fire
I will never tire
I am above all lords
I am the god of gods

Your shell is empty
It will not take a long for you to fall
Seventh is the sacred number
I've now awoken from years of slumber
