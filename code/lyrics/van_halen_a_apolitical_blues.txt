Song:

Well my telephone was ringing and
They told me it was chairman mao
Well my telephone was ringing and
They told me it was chairman mao
You got to tell him anything 'cause
I just don't want to talk to him now
I have a apolitical blues and
It's the meanest blues of all
I have a apolitical blues and
It's the meanest blues of all
I don't care if you're john wayne
I just don't want to take no calls
No calls
