Song:

Sometimes I feel like I'm just existing
I'm not really living
I'm only watching the time slip away
I've forgotten who I am in You
I'm not who I'm meant to be
I'm drifting farther away from my destiny

Chorus:
Awaken my heart, awaken my soul
Awaken Your power and take control
Awaken the passion to live for You, Lord
Awaken me

My soul is longing, my heart is searching
I'm desperate for You to move
Give me a hunger, pull me closer
I'm crying out to You

Awaken my heart, awaken my soul
Awaken Your power and take control
Awaken the passion to live for You, Lord
(repeat)

Open my eyes so I can see Your presence
Dwelling inside
Wake me up, 'cause I can't live another minute
If I'm not shining Your light

Awaken my heart, awaken my soul
Awaken the passion in me

Lord, awaken me to live my destiny
Lord, awaken me and shine Your light through me
Lord, awaken me to live my destiny
Lord, awaken me and shine Your light through me
