Song:

Its winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming - oh -
Sea-gulls are flyin over
Swans are floatin by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?

The nights draw in
Theres a silky moon up in the sky - yeah -
Children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?
Woh-woh-woh-woh

(dreaming)
So quiet and peaceful
Tranquil and blissful
Theres a kind of magic in the air
What a truly magnificent view
A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

(dreaming)
A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin by
Gentle rain beatin on my face
What an extraordinary place!
And the dreams of the child
Is the hope of the man

Its all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky - yeah -
Mountains are zoomin higher - mm -
Little girls scream an cry
My world is spinnin and spinnin and spinnin
Its unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?
Oooh - its bliss.
