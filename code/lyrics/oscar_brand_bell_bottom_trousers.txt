Song:

Singing Bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

There once was a waitress
Inthe Prince George Hotel
Her mistress was a lady
And her master was a swell
They knew she was a simple girl
And lately from the far
And so they watched her carefully
To heep her from all harm

Singing bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

First come the company
Of the Prince of Wales Huzzahs
They piled into the whorehouse
And they packed along the bars
Many a maid and mistree and a wife
Before them fell but they never made
The waitress from the Prince George Hotel

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

The Forty Second come marching into town
And with them come the compliment of
Rapists of renown
They busted every maidenhead that came
Within their spell but they never made
The waitress from the Prince George Hotel

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him Climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

One day there came a sailor an ordinary bloke
A bulgin at the trousers with a heart of solid oak
At sea without women for seven years or more
There wasn't any need to ask what he was looking for

Singing bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

He asked her for a cadlestick to light his way to bed
He asked her for a pillow to rest his weary head
And speaking very gently just as if he meant no harm
He asked her if she'd come to bed just so keep him warm

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

She lifted up the blanket and a moment there did lie
He was on her, he was in her in the twinkling of an eye
He was out again and in again and plowing up a storm
And the only word she said to him "I hope you're keeping warm"

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

Then early in the morning the sailor he arose
Saying here's a two pound my dear for the damage I have caused
If you have a daughter, bounce her on your knee
If you have a son, send the b*****d out to sea

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do

Now she sits aside the dock a baby on her knee
Awaitimg for the sailing ships acomin home from sea
Awaiting for the jollytars and navy uniform
And all she wants to do my boys is keep the navy warm

Singing of bell bottom trousers
Coats of navy blue
Let him climb the rigging
Like his daddy used to do
