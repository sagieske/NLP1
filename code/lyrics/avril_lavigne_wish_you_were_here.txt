Song:

I can be tough, I can be strong
But with you, it's not like that at all
There's a girl that gives a shit
Behind this wall you just walk through it

And I remember

All those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
Right now I wish you were here

All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

(Chorus)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
(I wish you were here)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
(I wish you were here)

I love, the way you are
It's who I am, don't have to try hard
We always say, say it like it is
And the truth, is that I really miss

All those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
Right now I wish you were here

All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

(Chorus)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
(I wish you were here)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
(I wish you were here)

No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I, never wanna let go
Let go oh oh (x2)

(Chorus)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here
(I wish you were here)
Damn! Damn! Damn! 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
(I wish you were here)
