Song:

[ Jason Mraz ]
Do you hear me , I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean , Under the open sky oh my, baby I'm trying .

[ Colbie Caillat ]
Boy I hear you in my dreams , I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart , You make it easier when life gets hard .

[ Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz ]
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend , Lucky to have been where I have been , Lucky to be coming home again oh ... oh ... oh ...

[ Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz ]
They don't know how long it takes , Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye , I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you , I will .

[ Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz ]
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend , Lucky to have been where I have been , Lucky to be coming home again , I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed , Lucky to be coming home someday .

[ Jason Mraz ]
And so I'm sailing through the sea , To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music, feel the air , I'll put a flower in your hair

[ Colbie Caillat ]
Though the breezes through trees , Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round ,You hold me right here right now

[ Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz ]
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend , Lucky to have been where I have been , Lucky to be coming home again , I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed , Lucky to be coming home someday .
