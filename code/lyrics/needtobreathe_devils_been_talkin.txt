Song:

Bag of bones and blood red cheeks
Guilty from the words I speak
Say the truth will set you free
But it won't for me
Cause I'm uneasy in my skin
Hangin on by a thread
Life it hasn't left me yet
But I won't forget
The devil's been talkin

The ship is setting off to sea
But it's sailing without me
I can't help but feel I'm on
An island born to sink
The devil's been talkin

We can't change who we are
We are all alone

I'm running out
Of this hole alone
These fingers bled
Down to the bone
And I can't move
This hell is cold
The chorus sings
This is home
The devil's been talkin

Bag of bones and blood red cheeks
Guilty from the words I speak
Say the truth will set you free
But it won't for me
The devil's been talkin
