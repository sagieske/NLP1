Song:

Close the blinds,
Turn down the sun
Let her run and hide,
Here they all come
With the hate in their eyes
And lies on their tounges,
So we stand and fight an army of one

Everybody wants to rule the word it seems,
If they fire first you know what this means

This is war
They don't really care about us
Don't play it by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war

All is fair
We don't care
X2

Skies are grey
We fight through the rain
Weve been hurt so long
We can't feel the pain
Breaking down the walls
With our bare hands
Every stone you through at us
Becomes amuntiton for us

No more turning back
Show them what were made of yeah
So we fire first
Ask questions later

This is war
They don't really care about us
Don't play it by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war

All is fair
We don't care
X2
We don't care

Too much at stake to be afraid
Put on your armour
Let us pray
We'll live to fight another day

This is war
They don't really care about us
Don't play it by the rules
Got nothing left to lose
This is war x2

All is fair
We don't care
