Song:

Twist me with your motivation
You make me sick
Won't you feel my frustration?
It's ten feet thick

All I see is apathy
In this world I won't be

I will be a better man
I won't be a bitter man

Twist me with your complication
This time it stuck
Curse me with your lips
You wretched f**k

Out of me am I free
In this world I won't be
