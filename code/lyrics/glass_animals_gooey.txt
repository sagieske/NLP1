Song:

I come close
Let me show you everything I know
The jungle slang
Spinning around my head and I stare.
While my naked fool 
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb.
A woozy youth
Dopes up on a silky smooth perfume.

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry,
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes.

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work.
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs.
I can't take this place, I can't take this place.
I just wanna go where I can get some space.

Truth be told, 
I've been here, I've done this all before.
I take your gloom,
I cut it up and puff it into plume,

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so, but you just gonna cry,
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes.

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work.
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs.
I can't take this place, I can't take this place.
I just wanna go where I can get some space.

Hold my hand, flow back to the summer time.
Tangled in the willows, now comes the tide.
How can I believe you, how can I be nice?
Tripping around the tree stumps in your summer smile.

Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip this smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I'd say I told you so but you just gonna cry,
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes.

My, my simple sir, this ain't gonna work.
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs.
I can't take this place, I can't take this place.
I just wanna go where I can get some space.
