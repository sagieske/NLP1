Song:

Today's the day
It fells like nothing has changed
But everything one thinks it has
I'm the same person
I was last year
Its not like I'm doing stupid wrong things
I'm just

[Chores]
Living a hard new life
I can make it
Trying to make it; it's all right
Living a hard new life
Today's the day I do something
And I it fells all right

Walking down the street
People following me
Can't they just go a way now?
I never thought it would be this way
I never thought I would I'll end up this way

[Chores]

I known I can make it
Don't push me down
Don't rock me all around

A hard new life
A hard new life
A hard new life
A hard new life

[Chores] x2
