To the left, take it back now ya'll
1 hop this time, right foot let's stomp
Left foot let's stomp, Cha Cha real smooth

Turn it down, to the left
Take it back now ya'll
1 hop this time, right foot let's stomp
Left foot let's stomp, Cha Cha now ya'll

Now it's time to get funky
To the right now, to the left
Take it back now ya'll
1 hop this time, 1 hop this time
Right foot 2 stomps, left foot 2 stomps
Slide to the left, slide to the right
Criscross, criscross
Cha Cha real smooth

Let's go to work
To the left, take it back now ya'll
2 hops this time, 2 hops this time
Right foot 2 stomps, left foot 2 stomps
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Get funky with it, aahhhhhhhhhh yaaaa

Right foot let's stomp, left foot let's stomp
Right foot again, left foot again
Right foot let's stomp, left foot let's stomp
