Song:

Start with colours
They always get away with attitude
But they'll try to convince you of your mood
What you want they'll give it to you
But it's only therapy, that's all they do
All they do
All they do
All they do

When the flag changes colours
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
Anti-pioneer
(This overlaps with)
All I do, all I do is make friends with you

When the flag changes colours
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go

When the flag changes colours
The language knows
When the month changes numbers
It's time to go
