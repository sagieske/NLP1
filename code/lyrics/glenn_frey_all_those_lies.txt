Song:

I woke up shakin' in a cold, cold sweat
I got so much goin' on. What did I forget?
I know there's somethin', but it got so late
I need someone to help me get my story straight
Who told shorty? Who told you?
And who else knows about the things I do?
It's my own bus'ness. It's my own fun
So don't you breathe a word of this to anyone
All those lies: I hope I can remember
All those lies: I'm a bad pretender
All those lies: Comin' back to haunt me
All those lies: I get the feeling like they want me

Listen, baby, you can take my word
Don't you believe a single lie you've heard
They're all out to get me and then get you
There's just no tellin' what these kind of people will do
They're sayin' certain things behind my back
I can't believe you'd listen to those one eyed jacks
They look you in the eye; say it with a smile
They wanna see you sad and lonely all the while

All those lies: I hope I can remember
All those lies: I'm a bad pretender
All those lies: It's a bad situation
All those lies: Try'n' to ruin my reputation

There's some bad wheels in motion, try'n' to run us down
Spreadin' dirty lies in this dirty little town
Ooh baby, you know I wouldn't dare
You know how much I love you. You know how much I care

All those lies: I hope I can remember
All those lies: I'm a bad pretender
All those lies: It's a bad situation
All those lies: Try'n' to ruin my reputation
