Song:

I wish I had cheated
At least that’s a reason
I’d understand why you’re leaving now

We both stopped breathing
It could not last
I guess I’m just afraid to ask

But what if you don’t?
What if you stay and ...


Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There’s no guarantee we’ll make it, make this thing right
But break your plans for me tonight
Tonight ...

You call this closure
It’s barely over
How do you move on so fast?

Maybe there’s someone
Maybe it’s all gone
I guess I’m just afraid to look back

But all that counts
Is what comes next

Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There’s no guarantee we’ll make it, make this thing right
Break your plans for me tonight

And I know better
Than to stay just wondering for it
Will you stay and be with me?

Break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There’s no guarantee we’ll make it, no guarantee we’ll make it
Just break your plans tonight
Lay your hand in mine
There’s no guarantee we’ll make it, no guarantee we’ll make it
Just break your plans for me tonight
