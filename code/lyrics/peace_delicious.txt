Song:

You're recently vicious
You used to be delicious
And everything just isn't enough enough enough

Any word you cry
Anything you throw
Any tide you change
Any flame you blow
Is never ever ever gonna break your fame
Forever ever ever gonna taste the same

If the world is just a bubble
And we were just a scribble
Then baby you're a riddle
I give I give it up

Any word you cry
Anything you throw
Any tide you change
Any flame you blow
Is never ever ever gonna break your fame
Forever ever ever gonna taste the same

Sit down and communicate
Words drift through my brain
If we were born to hesitate
And dream at another place
