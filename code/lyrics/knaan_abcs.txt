Song:

Bundle up my whole style is so cold
I glow like old guys who go bald
My flow got no front in the vocal
Your flow got no button it's so old

I don't mean to sound like a showboat
But it's true my persona's no joke
I stepped into some kinda portal
I'm legend and sometimes I'm noble

I'm from the most risky zone, oh
No place is more shifty global
More pistols, Russian revolvers
We shootin' all that is normal

But it ain't just because we want to
We ain't got nowhere we can run to
Somebody please press the undo
They only teach us the things that guns do

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Rock, you know my era
B-boy seasoning, salt-n-pepa
Grown and s***, come with the extra
Crushed up linen, fly like Cessna

This type brew, I gave it birth
Now it's time again to give it a verse
Jamaican born, not a fan of the ganja
Boulevard, Brooklyn to Somalia

And it goes in the background
Playa, that is my sound
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
Pioneer legend and they call me Mr. Rock

No B word or N word, I don't need those words
Respect for hers
The game dried up, so we come with the grease
Leadin' ya right and treatin' ya right, so peace

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

Superman is known by the locals
As this dude who's so fly it's global
Attitude that came outta struggle
Destitute but I make it hopeful

You real but my real is tenfold
My real will make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease, essential
Fight with guns or utensils

So bold, nothing's confidential
Breakfast was not continental
And lunch could not compliment all
We still become competent souls

These streets ain't paved with no gold
Matter fact someone stole the light bulb
Nobody fat enough for lypo
They don't teach us to read and write, so

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets

They don't teach us the abc's
We play on the hard concrete
All we got is life on the streets
All we got is life on the streets
