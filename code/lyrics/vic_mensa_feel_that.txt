Song:

Smoking on that g-pen got me tweaking, yeah, I feel that
And in that den it’s traffic season and I feel that
My b***h say, “Vic, baby, you crazy” yeah, I feel that
Them n****s fubu, they fugazi, lean got me lazy
I’m sipping on her, oh they say they drill, and they don’t do that
Say Vic the s**t boy that’s old news, I thought you knew that
I’m in that paper you get you one I get two of that
I need that, Vic boy up in Nordstrom, spend like three stack
I just bought my b***h three pairs of heels, yeah, she feel that
I might have a fefe on Ben Franklin, yeah, I’m throwing that
B***h, I think I’m Mcnabb with the eagle, I’m the quarterback, run it back
Throw a bullet at me, bet I’m bucking back
She drop down and p***y pop
I might put a Ben Franklin on top of that
I see a new watch, I’m copping that
I’m off the liquor and the kill and I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
She on the phone, she wanna f**k me and I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
I’m dope as s**t, I do that, I’m ups, I mail that
Molly right, they feeling it, brand new s**t like everyday
My money trust, they on the track
Nana clip they peel back
Bill Russell s**t got tall stacks
Put your little bills away
F**k pigs, bring home the bacon, yeah, I did that
I stashed them bundles in the basement where I hid that
Fly out to Jamaica on vacation ‘cause I live that, that’s real talk
My poppa said be patient and it will crack
I think I’m legend in the making, yeah, I feel that
She give me top, she give me skully, she don’t wear a hat
I need my money paid in fully, you aware of that
F**k you, mean b***h, I been that n***a and I’m still that
She drop down and p***y pop
I might put a Ben Franklin on top of that
I see a new watch, I’m copping that
I’m off the liquor and the kill and I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
She on the phone, she wanna f**k me and I feel that
I feel that
I feel that
