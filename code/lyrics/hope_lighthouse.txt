Song:

I wanna sing
While the ocean sleeps
I wanna feel
What it's like to be free
I wanna see
What you see in me
I wanna to know how it feels to believe

I feel lost somehow I'm drifting away
Was almost gone, you brought me to life again

So let me be your lighthouse
And I'll help you find the way out
Of here

I see the tide is coming
Don't let it take you away from me
There's no way I'm jumping over
I know it's your love that saved me

Cause I was lost
Somehow I'm drifting away
Was almost gone
You brought me to life again

So let me be your lighthouse
And I'll help you find the way out of here

I can see the light
From a far away out
But it's slowly drifting away from me

Cause I was lost
Somehow I drifted away
Was almost gone
You brought me to life again

So let me be your lighthouse
And I'll help you find the way out of here
Let me be your lighthouse
And I'll help you find the way out of here
