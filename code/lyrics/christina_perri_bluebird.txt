Song:

How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart
And teach itself to start beating again 

This little bluebird 
Came looking for you
I said that I hadn't seen you 
In quite some time! 

This little Bluebird
She came looking again
I said we weren't even friends
She could have you

Don't you think it was hard, 
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie
'Cause then I started to cry

This little bluebird 
Sure won't give it a rest
She swears that you may be
Better than all the rest
I said no no no
You've got it all wrong
If he was something special
I wouldn't have this song

Don't you think it was hard, 
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie
'Cause then I started to cry

How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart
Teach itself to start beating again

What if when she comes over 
I am in your arms
Taking all I want from you again
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba

How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart
Teach itself to start beating again

How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart
Teach itself to start beating again 
Beating again 

This little bluebird 
Don't come 'round here anymore
So I went looking for her
And I found you
