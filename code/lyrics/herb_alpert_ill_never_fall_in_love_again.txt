Song:

What do you get when you fall in love?
You only get lies, pain and sorrow
So for at least until tomorrow
I'll never fall in love again
I'll never fall in love again

What do you get when you fall in love?
What do you get when you fall in love?
What do you get when you fall in love?
What do you get when you fall in love?
