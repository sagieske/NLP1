Song:

Who comes this night, this wintry night
As to the lowly manger?
The shepherds and the kings did come
To welcome in the stranger

Who sends this song upon the air
To ease the soul that's aching?
To still the cry of deep despair
And heal the heart that's breaking

Brother Joseph bring the light
Fast, the night is fading
And who will come this wintry night
To where the stranger's waiting?

Who comes this night, with humble heart
To give the fullest measure
A gift of purest love to bring
What good and worthy treasure

Brother Joseph bring the lamb
For they are asking for Him
The children come this starry night
To lay their hearts before Him

For those who would the stranger greet
Must lay their hearts before Him
And raise their song in voices sweet
To worship and adore Him

Brother Joseph bring the light
Fast, the night is fading
And who will come this wintry night
To where the stranger's waiting

Brother Joseph bring the lamb
For they are asking for Him
The children come this starry night
To lay their hearts before Him

Pure of heart this starry night
To lay their hearts before Him
