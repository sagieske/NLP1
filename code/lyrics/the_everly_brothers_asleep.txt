Song:

Asleep
Please oh please let me fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Until morning I forget her

I lie awake in my lonely bed
In a room without a light
Trying hard to find a dream
That gets me through the night

But
Sleep won't come
It's never there
Since you're no longer mine
And sleep is such a precious thing
With your memory on my mind

Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep
It's so peaceful when I sleep
Until morning nothing matters

Asleep
If I could only fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Until morning I forget her

I hate to see the sun go down
And face another night
I watch the shadows climb the wall
As they try to catch the light

Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep...


Asleep
If I could only fall asleep
It's like heaven when I sleep
Untill morning I forget her

Asleep
Oh please let me fall asleep...
