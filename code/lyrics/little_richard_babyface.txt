Song:

""Baby face
You've got the cutest little baby face
There ain't nobody can ever take your place
You baby face
My poor hearts jumping
You started something

Baby face
Well I'm in heaven when I'm in
Your, your fond embrace
Yeah I never need no shove
Cuz I just fell I fell in love with your
Pretty pretty baby face
Let's twist awhile

Baby face, you know you got the cutest baby face
They'll never be nobody to take your place
You baby face
You got my two knees knocking
You ain't the girl with a hole in your stocking

But you're a baby face
I'm in heaven when I'm in your fond embrace yeah
I never need no shove
Cuz I just fell in love with your
Pretty pretty baby face
