Lyrics/Music Yellen/Pokrass
Why are grown up peoples faces
Wrinkled like a lot of prunes
Money money that's what chases them
Around like crazy loon's
I think they make a big mistake
Wealth and happiness that counts
Are free to all in large amounts

There's millions worth of golden sunbeams
That everybody can possess
All Gods children got success
Come and get your happiness
There's billions worth of silver moonbeams
Enough for everyone I guess
What's a million more or less
Come and get your happiness
Among the wildwood of your happy childhood
Where you were Jill's and Jack
In raggy britches there's a lot of riches
On which you don't pay any income tax
So get under their blue heaven
Away from trouble and distress
Just find Mother Nature's address
And come and get your happiness
