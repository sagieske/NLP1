Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree, and take to the air?
Me Neither
Have you ever stopped to finish out a rhyme but the right words just weren't there?
Meat Cleaver

The people in my life are like grains of sand
Cause they stick together
Yeah.. Often near my butt hole
If life is an ocean than I am a deep and handsome fish
A fish that's drowning
If the artistic process is a birth canal
Than I am a freshly jellied kid
Come witness my crowning
Cause thoughts of mine
Must be a sign that I'm

(Newer version)
If jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land?
Have you ever accidentally peed on the side of the toilet instead of your girlfriends face? Me neither.. Me neither!
(Older version)
Have you ever taken a side of bacon and jacked off watching babe? Me neither! Me neither!
Have you ever seen a girl on Halloween that looks like she's dressed for a rape? Yes, not her fault though you sick fucks

The people in my life are like blades of grass
Cause they're all so grounded but at least grass stays away from my b******e!
Art is a harlot
And I am her sassy urban friend
Mmm, b***h it's like your being so selfish
If momma is right and the world is my oyster
Than I must have an allergy to shellfish
You don't know
How could you know

If life makes you wish you were dead
Just put on a good movie and then promptly put a bullet in your head
Spend forever asleep, cause life pales in comparison to living the dream
