(d. Deviller/s. Hosein/c. Russell)

Think about you ev'ry minute
Dream about you ev'ry hour of the day
Close my eyes, and I think of your kiss
Well that's all that I've got
When you're so far away

It took some tears to let you
Thought that time would never heal me
You left my life, without a sound
After all we've been through
I still want you near me

Refrain:
A flame for you still burns
And so I'm savin' my love for you
A flame for you still burns
And I'm holdin' on
Yes. I'm holdin' on
Still in love with you (hey)

Remember how you get to safe and walk (ohh)
We built our life for two, oh
Guess I didn't recognize the signs
Coz I was lost in love
Lost in love with you

(repeat refrain)

Every once in a while
You find a love
That slips right through your hands
Gonna do my very best
To get you back again

A flame for you still burns
And so I'm savin' my love for you
(savin' all my love for you)
A flame for you still burns (hey)
And I'm holdin' on
Yes, I'm holdin' on
Still in love with you

A flame for you still burns (hey, baby)
And so I'm savin' my love for you (savin' all my love for you)
A falme for you still burn (still burn)
And I'm holdin' on
Yes, I'm holdin' on
Still in love with you

A flame for you still burns (hey)
And so I'm savin' my love for you (savin' all my love for you)
A flame for you still burns
And I'm holdin' on
Yes, I'm holdin' on
Still in love with you

A flame for you still burns
