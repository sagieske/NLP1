Song:

Staring at the moon so blue
Turning all my thoughts to you
I was without hopes or dreams
I tried to dull an inner scream
But you... Saw me through...

Walking on a path of air
See your faces everywhere
As you melt this heart of stone
You take my hand to guide me home
And now I'm in love

You took my heart away
When my whole world was gray
You gave me everything and a little bit more
And when it's cold at night
And you sleep by my side
You become the meaning of my life...

Living in a world so cold
You were there to warm my soul
You came to mend a broken heart
You gave my life a brand new start
And now... I'm in love

You took my heart away
When my whole world was gray
You gave me everything and a little bit more
And when it's cold at night
And you sleep by my side
You become the meaning of my life...

Holding your hand
I won't fear tomorrow
Here where we stand
We'll never be alone

You took my heart away
When my whole world was gray
You gave me everything and a little bit more
And when it's cold at night
And you sleep by my side
You become the meaning of my life
You become the meaning of my life
You become the meaning
You become the meaning of my life
