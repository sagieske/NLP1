Song:

Oh, I need you so bad
Oh, I need you so bad
Well, when we are together, baby
I have more fun than I've ever had

Well, I've been looking inside
Trying to find someone to call my own
Yes, I've been looking inside
Trying to find someone to call my own

But without your love, pretty baby
I would rather be left alone

I know my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many days
I know my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many days

Yes, please come to me, baby
Please don't turn my love away

Well, baby, I need you so
Yes, baby, honey
You know I need you so

Well, look right up
And say you'll take me
So I can live just once more
