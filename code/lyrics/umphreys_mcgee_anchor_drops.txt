Song:

Listen, was that you
Always on
If and when that's true
Waiting stops
Within moments new
Anchor drops

Breathe easy
The less you have to offer
The less you stand to lose
Think slowly
The more you have invested
The more you care to claim
Dream focused
As often as you've wandered

You carried too much weight
