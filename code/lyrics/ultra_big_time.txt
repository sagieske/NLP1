Song:

[K] Yeah.. P-I-Re-X
[T] Yeahh, hahahaha
[K] Kool Keith
[T] It's a brand new year, and we finally made it
[K] Tim Dog
[T] We finally made it boys, to the big time
[K] Yeah
[T] The big time..
[T] We're checkin all our hizzes, and handlin all our business
[K] Handle that
[T] Hey yo, pour me some more of that champagne
[Intro: Tim Dog]
Big time, laced down, diamonds on my wrist
Sippin Dom P in the limousine
Big time, stay crisp, always gettin chips
Makin mad moves with the gangsta lean
[Tim Dog]
Get money, get money, how we live every day
All work, no play, it's an everyday thing, hey
Get the chips aight? No need to flip
Last brother tried to trip got licked with the clip
Rappers runnin up to me sayin, "Yo, keep it real, represent"
Then I say, "Let me see you pay my rent"
Yo I gotta get those dead presidents
Cause rappers in the game ain't makin no sense
You couldn't bust a dollar out of fifteen cents
And now you tryin to front on my jewels and my mint, motherf..
You make me wanna hurt somethin
Word to God, I'ma beat you like you stole somethin
But I'ma chill and flex and cash checks and shine my Rolex
And drink wine; cause baby it's time to make the big time
[Chorus: Tim Dog]
Big time, laced down, diamonds on my wrist
Sippin Dom P in the limousine
Big time, stay crisp, always makin chips
Makin big moves with the gangsta lean
[Kool Keith]
You know they small time Tim yo, I blew they cover
I'm bigger than that, I bought them minks for they mother
Willie Bigs massage parlors built in every city
You play games on four-track, your steelo can't midi
Your whole entourage is duplicatin "Poppa Large"
