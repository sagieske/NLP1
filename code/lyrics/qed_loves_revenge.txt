Song:

When we were in love
Love was hurt by you
Love had put up with what you've done
Love bit you straight in the heart
Love bites the most painful part
That is love's only revenge

Love punishes you
For hurting me
It punishes you
For you defiyed it
It bites you for you've shown no love

Love's revenge
Is the hatred
Given bak to you
Love shall die
Shall die gripping your heart
Love shall not forgive
For you did not forgive

Love is enternal pain
You wouldn't have fallen in love
For love now give it's revenge
This in not your end
For love will not let you die
Love will bite your most weakest part,
Your Heart!

Love's Revenge is not sweet for you
But for it, it is sweet
Love will not parish
Love will not fade
But love will bite
Love's revenge
