Song:

They murdered their own to start and endless war
Sat back and relaxed as the buildings burned
This is the age of ignorance
It is a sickness that brings us to the end

The poisoned our food to keep their margins high
And as they count their money, the starving die
This is the age of ignorance
It is a sickness that brings us to the end

It's time to stand up, get ready to fight
For all the wrongs that should be right
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart
As it slowly falls apart

They could cure this cancer in the simplest ways
But the longer we are sick, the more the doctor gets paid
The longer we wait to get out of these days
The shorter we'll live and the faster we'll decay
This is the age of ignorance
It is a sickness that brings us to the end

It's time to stand up, get ready to fight
For all the wrongs that should be right
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart

If the people lead, the leaders will follow
The teachers will be the ones that never played this game

This is the age of ignorance
It is a sickness that brings us to the end

It's time to stand up, get ready to fight
For all the wrongs that should be right
Or watch the world as it slowly falls apart
We'll stand up for what we believe in
And won't back down til' they see the reason
To change the world before it slowly falls apart
