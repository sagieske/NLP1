Song:

Can't sleep tonight, 
'Cause you're on my mind.
I guess I'm in love once again.
Gaze a star, 
'Cause that's what you are.
You light up my life once again.

I'll take this chance for another romance in my

Life, 
'Cause you're all that I need.

I can't help myself, 
From falling in love, 
With somebody like you, 
'Cause your feelings are true.
Can't help myself, 
From falling in love.
For I can't help myself... 
From falling for you.

All day I pray, 
That forever you'll stay, 
And won't let our love fade away.
Hear what I say, 
Whatever comes away
We'll be together come what may.

I'll take this chance for another romance in my

Life, 
'Cause you're all that I need.

I can't help myself, 
From falling in love, 
With somebody like you, 
'Cause your feelings are true.
Can't help myself, 
From falling in love.
For I can't help myself... 
From falling for you.

I've never felt this love, 
Until you came, 
In my mind.

And I can't help myself, 
From falling in love, 
With somebody like you, 
'Cause your feelings are true.
Can't help myself, 
From falling in love.
For I can't help myself... 
From falling for you.
