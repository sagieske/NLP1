Song:

Always Be A Child
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan
I was there
When you drew the breath of life
And I could hear your voice
The first time that you cried
And though you couldn't see Me
I was very near
And there's something now
That I want you to hear
Chorus:
You will always be a child
In my eyes
And when you need some love
My arms are open wide
And even when you're growing old
I hope you realize
You will always be a child
In my eyes
I was there the first time
That you prayed
And I heard
All the promises you made
And when you fell before Me
Crying, Father, I have sinned
I picked you up
And held you close again
Chorus (repeat)
