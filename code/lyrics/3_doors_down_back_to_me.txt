Song:

I have poured out my heart, laid it right here for you
I've tried so hard, that's the best that I can do
Please understand I am not who I was

You used to be all that I had, Now your just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know then I can get back to Me

Tears forget, that's more than I can do
Cause they don't wash away, all the things that we been through
I've put behind me my share of the shame, we could call villains but it's
All in vein

You used to be all that I had, Now your just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know then I can get back to Me

All of my life I've waited, hoping wanting you to see me the way that I am
But now I know that I'm not alone...
Someone understands...

You used to be all that I had, Now your just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know then I can get back to Me
You've got to know that...
You used to be all that I had, Now your just not what I need
I've got to get over you and I know then I can get back to Me
