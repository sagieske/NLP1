Song:

Eh, yo what
This is Andrew E. One time again for your mind
But this time I might take it slow and low
So here we go
It's about a girl na mahilig mag-fax
I mean, you know, as in fax machine
And goes a little something like this

It was a Friday night, I'm feeling alright
I signed with Sony, future looked bright
Mag-ga-gabi na, ako'y nasa labas pa
Nag-dinner ako, well, kasi gutom na
Time to celebrate, the world is mine
Perfect timing to wine and dine
I went to Malate derecho Outback
Australian beef, time to niak
Sat down the table, nanood ng cable
I ordered Spumati kasi I'm stable
Willing and able, I'm still single
Looking for a girl na makaka-mingle
Nang may dumating, anak ng pating
Sa aking harapan, 'sang balikbayan
"Andrew E., right?"
"Fresh from the flesh, that's me,
Here's my number, fax me"

Chorus:
Fax me in the morning (oh yeah)
Then just walk away (that's it baby, that's it)
We will fax tomorrow (why oh why)
Coz we fax yesterday, yeah... Hey
Ah... Ah...

So finax ko siya
Excited ang Andrew
Finax din niya ako, not one, not two
Pero ten times, what else can I say?
Finax niya ako, s**t, all damn day
At habang fina-fax ko siya
Kinakausap ko siya, kinakausap niya ako
Tinatanong niya ako
"Have you ever been faxed before?"
"Yeah, but not like this so fax me more"
"Good"
Nagfa-fax kami, nag-e-enjoy kami
Nag-internet kami kahit walang kape
Pero may sugar at mayroong whipped cream
Nagfa-fax kami kahit sa dilim
So fax, fax ng fax baby, yeah that's it
Sumisigaw every time na makaka-transmit
We fax all day and we fax all night
We fax and it's alright

Chorus:
Fax me in the m
