Song:

This is not written by outlandish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will reach my goal
No one has control of my home country, don't front me
F*****g iranies sittin n chillin, no one is willin to help the children
Yes I'm talking bout the billion
My brothers are dying cause the people are lying yeah.

Chorus:
In my land is occupation
The fuck'd up my nation
What's my destination
To much bad vabration

Baloch what is that its an uknown nation
Don't make me attack with my tiger vabration
Cause they'are tryin to forget an baloch nation
Tell me what you'are chasing
Beautiful beaches, people eatin peaches
Tryin to show what the value of what each is.

My brothes are getting no respect from the iranian meat heads
If ya wanna come to help my dessertfull nation
Which is dead like a badly hurt pation.

Chorus:
In my land is occupation
The fuck'd up my nation
What's my destination
To much bad vabration
