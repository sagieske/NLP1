Song:

I am the one that is walking the night
Sleepless I'm dreaming- eyes wide open
Watching the sky for the ashes to fall
Endless illusions- I keep on hoping

For this world to survive- to keep me alive

So for all you ever desired, you wanted to be
Was shining so bright but only a dream
And nothing remains but this fantasy
Oh this world is falling down

Frozen by gold that has turned me to ice
I kept all these secrets deep inside me

Now I will pass them on- no, now you are the one

So for all...

Et audivi vocem magnam dicentem septem angelis
Effundite septem fialas asperitae mundi in somnium
Vidi c** aperuisset sigillum sextum
Terrae motus factus est
Magnus sol factus est niger luna tota facta est sicut sanguis

And as it opened the final seal
I stood alone on crumbled ground
The stars had fallen And the sun was cold

This world has never been
Only for the seeing it will be seen
I was given the seal and the key
And I will keep it until I die

It's falling down for you
