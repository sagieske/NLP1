Song:

Keeping my eyes on the road, I see you. Keeping my hands on the wheel, I hold
You
99 miles from L.A. I kiss you, I miss you, please be there
Passing a white sandy beach, we're sailing Turning the radio on, we're dancing
99 miles from L.A. I want you, I need you, please be there
The windshield is covered with rain, I'm crying Pressing my foot on the gas,
I'm flying Counting the telephone poles, I phone you Reading the signs on the
Road, I write you
99 miles from L.A. We're laughing, we're loving, please be there We're
Laughing, we're loving, please be there
