Song:

Tulsa

Intro:
Well, you see, I'll pretend I'm at home getting ready for a date.
I take a comb, comb my hair
Take a flower, smell it, put it in my lapel
And I spot the audience!

Verse:
Once my clothes were shabby
Tailors called me, "Cabbie"
Got so rough I took a vow
Said this bum'll
Be Beau Brummel
Now I'm smooth and snappy
Now my tailor's happy
I am the cats meow
My wardrobe is a wow!
Paris silk! Harris tweed!
There's only one thing I need...

Refrain:
Got my tweed crest
Got my best vest
All I need now is the girl
Got my striped tie
Got my hopes high
Got the time and the place
And I got rhythm
Now all I need is the girl to go with'm
If she'll
Just appear we'll
Take this big town for a whirl
And if she'll only say, "My darling I'm yours"
I'll throw away
My striped tie
And my best-Pressed tweed
All I really need
Is the girl.

Patter:
[speaking] I start off easy, you see?
Now I'm more debonair...
Ssssssssssssssh! Aaaaah! Break... Now! Yeah!
And I settle here... I start this step, see?
And then I build it... Double it!
She appears all in white and I take her hand,
Kiss it and lead her on the floor...
This step's good for the costume... Astaire's pat!
Dah dah dah dah... Dah dah dah dah yah dah...
Now we waltz, springs come in
And I lift her... Again... Once more!
And now the tempo changes and all the lights come up
And I build for the finale
Louise, that's it!
Come on over here...
Follow me... Faster! Charleston...
Again... Do it again! Ha ha ha!
