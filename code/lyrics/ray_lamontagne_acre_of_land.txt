Song:

I'm a-gonna buy me an acre of land
Yes, I'm gonna build me a home with my very own hands
Gonna dig me a little garden
And watch that garden grow
And take it slow
Take it slow
Let it grow

I'm a-gonna find me a high place to stand
Then I'm gonna find me the girl, gonna take my hand
Gonna have ourselves some children
Watch those children grow
And take it slow
Let them grow
Take it slow

I'm a-gonna buy me an acre of land
Then I'm gonna build me a home with my very own hands
Gonna plant me a little garden
And watch that garden grow
And take it slow
Take it slow
Let it grow
