Song:

Might be that we have
Different views sometimes
Whoa, but that's all right
You're still a friend of mine

Sometime you go your way
Sometimes I'll go mine
Whoa, but that's all right
You're stil a friend of mine

Oh, might not like your lady
You might not like mine
Whoa, but that's all right
You're still a friend of mine

Yeah, you're still a friend of mine
Yeah, you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine

You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine
You're still a friend of mine

Come on, y'all

You changed my cloudy days to sunshine
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine
You made clear waters out of muddy
I'm so thankful that you're my buddy

You're a friend of mine
Hey, hey, now
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine

Let me introduce you
To some friends of mine

On piano, we got Ray Jackson
A friend of mine
On, uh, percussion
We got us a lady
Bobbie Hall on percussion

On drums, we got my good friend
Mister James Gadson
On guitar, we got
Mister Bernard Blackmon

And on bass, we got
Old cool, quiet Melvin Dunlap
Melvin's so quiet
He said eight words last year
And six of those were airport

You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
Hey, now, you're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine

You changed my cloudy days to sunshine
I'm so glad you're a friend of mine
You made clear waters out of muddy
I'm so thankful that you're my buddy

Now you're a friend of mine
Yeah, now you're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine
You're a friend of mine

You're a friend of mine
Now you're a friend of mine
