Song:

Well I could be wrong
But I swear that I knew you
In another life

And I could be dreaming but I swear
That I knew you in another life

Something happened just the other night;
I had a vision in the middle of a daydream
In a place I'd never been before
I couldn't tell if I was still awake or sleeping

I saw so many things I barely recognized
I thought that I was lost but then I saw you

I could be wrong, but I swear
That I knew you in another life
And I could be dreaming, but I swear
That I knew you in another life

Certain things affect me certain ways
And this isn't just the first time
That it's crossed my mind

Something happens and the crystal clears
And you begin to recognize all of the little signs
I wish that I could place every little gesture
But it really doesn't matter 'cause we'll never know
