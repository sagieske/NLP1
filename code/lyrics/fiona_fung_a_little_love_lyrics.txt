Song:

Greatness as you
Smallest as me
You show me what is deep as sea

A little love, little kiss
A litlle hug, little gift
All of little something. these are our memories

You make me cry, 
Make me smile, 
Make me feel that love is true... 
You always stand by my side, 
I don't want to say goodbye.

You make me cry, 
Make me smile, 
Make me feel the joy of love.
Oh! Kissing you... 
Thank you for all the love you always give to me, 
Oh! I love you... 

(* Repeat from the beginning * 01 time)

Yes I do, I always do... 

Make me cry, 
Make me smile
Make me feel that love is true
You always stand by my side
I don't want to say goodbye.

You make me cry, 
Make me smile, 
Make me feel the joy of love
Oh! Kissing you... 
Thank you for all the love you always give to me, 
Oh! I love you... 

To be with you... Oh! I love you...
