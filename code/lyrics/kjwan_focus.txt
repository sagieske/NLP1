Song:

Take this away from me
Take away this poison

It's making it hard to see
I'm slowly falling under

Focusing on my hand
Save me from my emotions
I have lost my hold on my mind
I can't find what you seek in me
I am not what you once loved
Bleeding from these wounds

Wish that I was a numb
No words left unspoken
Focusing on my hands
