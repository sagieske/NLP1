Song:

Alright

Some kind of animal is stalkin’ your trail
Some weird unconformity, outside your tail
Bugbear, nightmare, castles in the air
I wonder if this game is fair

Some kind of animal is loose in the night
Leaping and shrieking in freakish delight
Some kind of animal let out on the stage
But surrounded by people like the bars of a cage
Look out now

Some kind of animal
You make me feel like
Some kind of animal
Makes love like

Some kind of animal
Gonna die like
Some kind of animal

Some kind of animal
You must feel like
Some kind of animal
You make love like

Some kind of animal
You’re gonna die like
Some kind of animal

Some kind of animal exists in us all
Instinct awakens to it’s primitive call
Bug-a-boo after you
Look out now, it’s comin’ through

I wonder if this dream is true

I wonder if it’s me or you

Animal
Animal
