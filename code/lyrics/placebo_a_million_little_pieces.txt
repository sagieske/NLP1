Song:

There wasn't much I used to need
A smile would blow a summer breeze through... 
... My heart

Now my mistakes are hauting me
Like winter came and put a freeze on... 
... My heart

I lost the power to understand
What it takes to be a man with... 
... My heart

I saw you wanted this to end
You tried your best to be a friend to... 
... My heart

But I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love
Understand.

Whenever I was feeling wrong
I used to go and write a song from... 
... My heart

But now I fear I lost my spark
No more glowing in the dark for... 
... My heart

So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love
Understand.

Understand. (x4)

Understand.
(Can't you see I'm sick of fighting)
Understand.
(Cant you tell I've lost my way)
Understand.
(Look at me, there's no denying)
Understand.
(I wont last another day)

So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love
Understand

That I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving, my love
Understand.

All my dreaming
Torn in kisses
All my dreaming
Torn in kisses
All my dreaming
Torn in pieces
All my dreaming
Torn in kisses
Now.
