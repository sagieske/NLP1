Song:

I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

[Rap]
It’s the same game today as it always is, I don't give these places fake my name explaining this, and the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines that remind me of all the times...
I have committed dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted to what I’ve done and what I’m doing I’m brewing and losing and spewing infusing and believe me that’s what all the kids are doing.
What kids are doing are killing themselves, they feel they have no control of their prisoner’s cell, and if you’re one of them then you’re one of me, and you would do almost anything just to feel free...
Am I right? Of course I am, convince me otherwise would take all night. Before you walk away, there’s one more thing I want to say,

Our brains are sick but that's okay.

Fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down
I'll fake you out

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

(Repeat 2x)
All I wanna
Yeah, And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out

All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
