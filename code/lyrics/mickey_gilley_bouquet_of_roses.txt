Song:

I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as a goal of love beats the roses
Yours will fall like petals when we part.

I begged you to be different
But you always will be untrue
I'm tired of forgiving
Now there's nothing left to do.

Now I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart.

--- Instrumental ---

I know that I should hate you
After all that you put me through
But how can I be better
When I'm so in love with you.

Well, I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you've broke my heart.

I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart...
