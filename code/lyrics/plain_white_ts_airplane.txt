Song:

Airplane, airplane
Put me to sleep again
Take me away
Off to a dream
And then I'll fly
So high across the sky
And wake in a new place
Where mistakes of my past are erased

Don't drop me
Don't stop me
Just hold me
So cosy

Airplane, airplane
Don't you go down today
Take me away
Off to a better place
You know just where I'd like to go
Please get me there on time
Don't delay me from losing my mind

Don't drop me
Don't stop me
Just hold me

Airplane, airplane
Don't you go down today
Take me away
Off to a better place
You know just where I'd like to go
Please get me there real soon
I've important things that I must do
