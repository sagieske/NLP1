Song:

(g. goffin / c. king / j. wexler)

Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
But when i knew i had to face another long, long day
Girl i used to feel so tired

Before the day i met you
Life had been so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind
'cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know, i didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me to name it
Now i'm no longer doubtful of what i'm living for
But if i make you happy i don't need to do more
'cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man

Oo baby, baby look what you have done to me
Can't you see that you made me feel so good inside
Don't you know that i just want to be
Close to you, you made me feel so alive
'cause you made me feel, you made me feel
You made me feel like a natural man

Baby i ain't doubtful of what i'm living for
But if i make you happy i don't need to do more
'cause you made me feel, you made me feel
Well you made me feel like a natural man
