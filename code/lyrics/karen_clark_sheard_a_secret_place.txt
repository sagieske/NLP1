Song:

This world sometimes seems cruel and cold
And pain doth pierce my very soul,
But there's a place, a secret place,
A place where I can go.

Ooooooooooooooooohh.

A place of peace,
Where love abides,
Where justice reigns
And God resides,
There is a place,
A secret place,
A place where I can go,

For you shall hide me in your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies persue me,
You'll keep me safe from harm,

And when my heart
Is filled with pain,
No peace it seems
Ill find again
I find that place
A secret place
A place where I can go

Choir:
For you shall hide me in your tabernacle
From the rain and storm
And even when my enemies persue me
You'll keep me safe from harm

There is safety, in your tabernacle
There is protection, in your tabernacle
There is security, in your tabernacle
There is sanctuary, in your tabernacle
Lord take me, to your tabernacle
I wanna go, to your tabernacle
Lord take me, to your tabernacle
Lord there you'll reign
Hide me-safely-in your-dwelling-place

There is a place
A secret place
A place where I can go
Ooooh a secret place
A dwelling place
I wanna go
I wanna go.
