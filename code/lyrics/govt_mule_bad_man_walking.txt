Song:

Hey, can I tell you a little story
About a bad man looking for glory?
Oh, he wasn't such a bad man
But he kindly let his fame seep into his brain

Hey, can I tell you a little secret?
You see, the bad man, he was a lot like me
Oh, he had a little wisdom
But he traded it away for a fifteen minute reign

Bad man walking, bad man
Bad tongue talking

Hey, can you spare a little sympathy?
'Cause right now I think it's what I really need
Oh, do you think you really know yourself?
Are you sure what you might do
If the choice was up to you?

Bad man walking, bad man
Bad tongue talking

Bad man walking, bad man
Bad tongue talking, bad man
Bad man walking, bad man
Bad tongue talking
