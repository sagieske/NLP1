Song:

Sorry, I didn’t call
Before I showed up here conked and all
Messed up from the last time we talked
When you hung up on me

It’s Saturday, it’s 3 am
But I’m not sorry that I’m here again
And I’m going crazy thinking you are with him
And I don’t wanna leave...

You alone for another minute
Ain't that bad
Without me
In it

I tried all there is to try
I'm not every single lie
To make myself believe in something
I know Isn’t true

I'd drink all there is to drink
I'd thought all there is to think
I’ll dissapear forever
If you want me to

And I’ll find somebody new
But I can’t love anyone...
But you
Oooh
Anyone but you
(I can’t love anyone)

I know you said we need a little break
But that was six months ago, yesterday
And it ain’t like I've been counting the days
But I can’t take one more

That’s why I’m out here in the rain
That’s why I’m willing to take the blame
That’s why I only ever want to say your name

I tried all there is to try
I’m not every single lie
To make myself believe in something
I know isn’t true

I'd drink all there is to drink
I'd thought all there is to think
I’ll dissapear forever
If you want me to

And I’ll find somebody new
But I can’t love anyone...
But you
Anyone but you)

If this is want you want
Then look me in the eyes
But I’m prayin' you won’t...
Say your last goodbye

I tried all there is to try
I’m not everything you lie
To make myself believe in something
I know isn’t true

I'd drink all there is to drink
I'd thought all there is to think
I’ll dissapear forever
If you want me to

And I’ll find somebody new
But I can’t love anyone...
But you
(I can’t love anyone)
Ooh

(I can’t love anyone)
Anyone but you
(I can’t love anyone)
(I can’t love anyone)
Anyone but you

You said we need a little break
But that was six months ago, yesterday
I can’t love anyone...
But you
