Song:

A suburban man at my door
But I don't think I'll let him in
He wants discipline
Discipline, control over the way I live
Wants the best for me
Old school philosophy
But I can't turn my back on him
He's a part of me
Buy me anything but I just need a friend

It's all for you
You got me where you want
It's all for you, oh
Just stop breaking my heart
You're the blood of a seed and it's all that I need
Got me where you want
It's all for you, oh
You got me, oh, you got me

Jack kerouac k-k-k-kerouac
On the road and in my head
And the irrelevance, intelligence
A new tattoo a lot more sex
Broken families
A new enemy
And you will not make up for this
This suburban man he wants discipline
But I just need a friend

It's all for you
You got me where you want
It's all for you
Just stop breaking my heart
You're the blood of a seed and it's all that I need
Got me where you want
It's all for you
You got me, oh, you got me where you want

Leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone

So never run
You got me where you want
All for you, stop breaking my heart

Youuuuuuuuuu
You got me where you want
Its all for you, oh
Stop breaking my, stop breaking my heart
You're the blood of a seed and it's that I need
Got me where you want
Its all for you, oh
Cause you got me, oh, you got me where you want
It's all for you
Oh just stop breaking my, stop breaking my heart
It's all for you, oh
Got me, got me where you want
It's all for you
My heart
It's all for you, oh
You got me oh, you got me where you want
Leave me alone
