Song:

We dance in the desert
I feel a glance of your eye
The sun is burning on the sand
Yearning bodies hand in hand

Circles of love turn my head
I deserve and i'll get
All your lovin' tonight
And my fire will burn
Innocence won't return

Your face across the far sky
I loose myself in your eyes
I'm counting nights and days
Waiting for the next embrace

I realize you drive
Me crazy in my mind
Love came face to face with life
All emotions in my mind
I try to cover try to hide
