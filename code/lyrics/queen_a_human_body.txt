Words and music by roger taylor

They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur
Captain scott and his heroes to be
To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh its been such a long ride
Ooh you know its been a long way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
With a human body you see

There aint nobody gets out of this moonlight
Today is surprisingly fair
Oh oh oh oh woo woo

Weve got problems the lone ranger can't fix
The invisible man couldn't see
It takes a tough guy
To learn some new tricks
Ooh it takes such a long time
Ooh its been such a long way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
With a human body you see

You know its been such a long while
Its been such a long while
Takes such a long time
It takes such a long time
Its been such a long way
Been such a long way
Its been such a long while
Been such a long while
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Its gonna be a long ride
