Song:

Shapely, dazzling, classy, sassy
I'm coming close but no cigar
Oh I can't seem to find a word
That sums up what you are

Searching far and wide
To find a word for what I see
But I keep coming back empty handed
Nothings good enough for you to me

Dictionary how come I can't find
Any words inside you that apply
None of these words seem to catch my eye
We need a new word for her
We need a new word for her

Smart and charming, yet it's alarming just
How disarming she can be
I'm a bit concerned with lack of
W-O-are-D
You're my favorite question
And the answer to my dreams
I am not a writer
But I figured I may have to be, yeah

Dictionary how come I can't find
Any words inside you that apply
None of these words seem to catch my eye
We need a new word for her

You enter "You"
Well I Googled you it ain't helping
Girl, I thought I knew but I didn't
Somebody please we need a word inventor intester
Somebody get me the number to Webster
Right now, right now

Dictionary how come I can't find
Any words inside you that apply
None of these words seem to catch my eye
We need a new word for her
We need a new word for her
