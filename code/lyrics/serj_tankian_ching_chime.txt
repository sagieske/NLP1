Song:

Why make time?
When no one pays a dime
To remunerate a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Creating a crime
Just armed with Melodyne
Looking at a mime
The rhymes are all mine
But no one pays no mind
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

In the daytime
Face covered by the grime
Sucking on a lime
When no one pays no mind
Slapping on a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Superbowl, half time
Anytime is war time
Second season's past time
Gonorrhea, overtime
F**k that it's bedtime
No more friend of mine
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

I'll f**k your mind
Over the spring time
Degrading in your prime
A thought so asinine
But no one pays no mind
And no one pays a dime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Open your eyes don't be this way
Though all your dreams are swept away
The stairs will rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

Superbowl, half time
Anytime is war time
Second season's past time
Gonorrhea, overtime
F**k that it's bedtime
No more friend of mine
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

I'll f**k your mind
Over the spring time
Degrading in your prime
A thought so asinine
But no one pays a dime
And no one pays a dime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Open your eyes don't be this way
Though all your dreams are swept away
The stairs will rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

The waters will rush but don't dismay
Our smiles will cross, the world will stay
The bridge has crossed itself today
Now close your eyes and sway this way, sway this way

(Hey!)

(Leylia, Ley, Ahh, Ley, Leylia, Leylia, Ley, Ley)

Open your eyes don't be this way
Though all your dreams are swept away
The stairs will rise from yesterday
Your tears and fears all melt away

The waters will rush but don't dismay
Our smiles will cross, the world will stay
The bridge has crossed itself today
Now close your eyes and sway this way, sway this way

(Hey!)

To remunerate a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

(Hey)

Creating a crime
Just armed with melamine
Looking at a mime
The rhymes are all mine
But no one pays no mind
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

In the daytime
Face covered by the grime
Sucking on a lime
When no one pays no mind
Slapping on a rhyme
Over the ching chime
Over the ching chime
Ch-ch ch-ching chime

Superbowl, half time
Anytime is war time
