Song:

You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
[Voice] I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control oh oh 
But you don't really give a shit 
[Voice] you go with it go with it go with it 
Cause you're fucking crazy rock'n'roll 

[Bridge] 
You said hey 
What's your name 
It took one look 
And now I'm not the same 
Yeah you said hey 
And since that day 
You stole my heart 
And you're the one to blame 

[Chorus] 
Yeah 
And that's why I smile 
It's been a while 
Since every day and everything has 
Felt this right 
And now you're turning it all around 
And suddenly you're all I need 
The reason why I smile 

Last night I blacked out I think 
[Voice]What did you, what did you put in my drink 
I remember making out and then oh oh
I woke up with a new tattoo 
[Voice] your name was on me and my name was on you 
I would do it all over again 

[Bridge]

You said hey (hey)
What's you name (What's your name)
It took one look 
And now I'm not the same
Yeah you said hey (hey)
And since that day (since that day)
You stole my heart
And you're the one to blame 

[Chorus]

Yeah
And that's why I smile 
It's been a while 
Since everyday and everything has
Felt this right 
And now you're turning it all around 
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile 
The reason why I smile 

You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control 
You know that I'm a crazy bitch 
I do what I want when I feel like it 
All I wanna do is lose control 

[Chorus]

And that's why I smile 
It's been a while 
Since everyday and everything has
Felt this right 
And now you're turning it all around 
And suddenly you're all I need
The reason why I smile 
The reason 
The reason why I smile
The reason why I smile
