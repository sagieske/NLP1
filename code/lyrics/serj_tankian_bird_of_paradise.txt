Song:

Just a kiss from your lips and I'm.. Gone
Just a smile from your touch and I'm.. Gone
Just a touch from your words makes me whole
And the glance from your eyes says home.
I see what you're doing, you're piling it all up one by one,
Pulling from the stars, drinking the teas,
I see what you'Re doing, you'Re piling it all up one by one,
Pulling the eyes, pulling the teas,
And crossing them all out!
.. Just a kiss from your lips,
Just a smile from your touch and I'm gone
Just a touch from your words makes me whole
And the glance from your eyes says home.
I see what you're doing, you're piling it all up one by one,
Pulling from the stars, drinking from the seas,
I see what you'Re doing, you'Re piling it all up one by one,
Pulling the stars, pulling the seas,
And crossing them all out!
Don't you want to be my love?
Can't we suddenly elope?
Try and cross the sea above
Can't we suddenly elope
Don't you want to be my love?
Can't we suddenly elope?
Try and cross the sea above
Can't we suddenly elope?
Just a kiss, a kiss from your lips
And I...
