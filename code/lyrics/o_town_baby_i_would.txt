Song:

Would I walk through fire just to be with you, to be with you, yeah
Would I cross an ocean just to hold you, yeah
Would I give up all I have to see you smile, to see you smile
Would I walk through hell and not think twice

Chorus:
Baby I would
Baby I will
Baby I'll do that gladly
Be all you need
Do anything, to make you happy
Baby I could
Baby I can
Do anything you ask me
Baby I can
Baby I could
Baby I would

Would I be the harbor always there for you,
Right there for you, baby
Would I be the shelter that would shield you, yeah
Would I be the loving light to ligth your way,
To light your way honey
And would I defend you with my life
Life

Chorus

Ill keep you from the cold
Ill be there to hold you
And if tears should find your eyes,
Your eyes
I would be the one to dry them,
Be the one to dry them
I would risk it all and give it all to you
Baby i....

Baby I will, I will
Baby I'll do that gladly
Ill be all you need,
Ill do anything to
Make you happy

Baby I could, I can
Anything you ask me
Baby I can, baby I could
Baby I would
Do anything you ask me
Baby I can, baby I could
Baby I would
Ill do anthing for you girl
Baby I can, baby I could
Baby I would
Cause you're the one I want in my world

Baby I can, baby I could
Baby I would
