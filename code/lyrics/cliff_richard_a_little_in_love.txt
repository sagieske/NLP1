Song:

It's been so long you say you've had fun
And you've been happy with the things you've done
Now you feel strange and a little unreal
Well I can understand the way you feel
You're just a little in love just a little
You're just a little in love just a little

Well I can see what's happenin' to you
You feel alone but it's just not true
And there's one thing you oughta know ooh ooh
I need you so
I'm just a little in love just a little
I'm just a little in love just a little

You say you're willing to learn
You need a friend a friend who will help you
Cause you're just a little in love woh yeah
A little in love you are a little in love
With someone - you're just like me
Like me you're a little in love woh yeah a little in love

You know sometime you look somewhere
You're not alone but there's no-one there
No-one to turn to
No-one to see
The way you're feelin' you're just like me
You're just a little in love just a little
You're just a little in love just a little

You say you're willing to learn
You need a friend a friend who will help you
Cause you're just a little in love woh yeah
A little in love you are a little in love
With someone - you're just like me
Like me you're in love woh yeah a little in love

Key change

You're in love - woh yeah
A little in love you are
A little in love with someone you're just like me
Like me you're in love...
