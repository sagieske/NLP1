Song:

One last time in my easy chair
Where all my time's a waking dream
Staring up at the milky way
Head tilt back I drift downstream
Now floating by my easy chair
Come bits of birthday toys I lost
The slippery witch from my first nightmare
The love letter I forgot
Into the Rusty Treasure chest
Crawled my imaginary friend
With the monsters under my bed
And never came back out again
One last time in my easy chair
Easy chair
And in the weary light of dawn
Something's gone I'm not quite sure what
And the memory is Torn
