Song:

Uh
Big Will and Tra-Knox
Yo yo yo yo jump
When I tell you make your way up to the front
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what you want
The don jiggy catering to what your feeling
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling
Shake
What ya momma gave you baby don't let nothin' break
Yo watch cause we don't care how much time it's gonna take
Dance floor packed and it's lookin' like a lake
It's obduction here's your instructions
Slide
Get up off that wall girl stop tryin' to hide
Trackin' afrodesiac won't be denied
Chill with that cigarette take it outside
Messin' with my vibe
I don't like that
Bounce
I'm a pressure player and
I'm gonna hit it where it counts it counts
Party like a lamb and a wolf about to pounce
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling
Pack it to the floor up to the ceiling

Bring it all or nothing
Ain't no time for frontin (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
The only floor is jumpin'
Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know

I-I-I-I called Jazzy Jeff on the phone
I said, "I'm downstairs waitin' joka come on"
I told him there's this hot spot we gotta burn
He said, "Man after last weekend haven't you learned?"
Yo look buddy last weekend was a mistake
That mommy tryin' to dish out what she couldn't take
Come back me at dancin' like this thing is a game
One little move on her and she bust into flames (whoosh)
The whole club runnin' tryin' to ruin my night
I told her roll around little she'll be aight
Then everybody mad at me all up in my face
Somebody should've told that girl to stay in her place
You feel a little heat baby girl I'm behind ya
And hopefully your burnt booty dress will remind ya
Of how serious I am I know it's crazy y'all
But if you wanna play honey go get a baby doll
Holla at me

Bring it all or nothing
Ain't no time for frontin(come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
The only floor is jumpin'
Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know

Uh uh huh
Check and make sure I'm lookin' cute for her
Check and make sure I'm packin' lute for her
Cause I'm about to shut down the bar for her
And later open up my car door for her
7 pm I leave the set and then
No more actin' back to rappin' again
Red carpet hectic gettin' me in
What happened last week sure it could happen again
Mos def full funk when ya lookin' at the front lookin' like a jet magazine
Beauty of the month
Shades low layin' leggy low on the cut
Told myself you're the one to shake it up with
Bounce
Over to your table came completey unannounce
Observe the curves body fat about an ounce
Hormones pumpin' out at dangerous amounts
Grabbed ya arm turn around girl
Jump
Move when I tell ya make your move up to the front
Addicted to the way I kick it I know what ya want
The don jiggy catering to what you're feeling
Pack it from the floor up to the ceiling
Come on

Bring all or the nothing
Ain't no time for frontin'(come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
The only floor is jumpin'
Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
Bring it on the nothing
Ain't no time for fun things (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
The only floor is jumpin'
Ooh these girls are somethin' (come on)
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
Come on
Jump on
The only floor is jumpin'
Come on
Just let it flow (jump on)
Act like you know
Big Will uh
Tra-Knox uh
Foundation laid to the rock y'all
One time we out what
