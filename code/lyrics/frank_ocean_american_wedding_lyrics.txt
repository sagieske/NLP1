Song:

I took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-are-s dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive
Then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
Afterschool she ran to me
Jumped in my 5. 0
This is the home of the brave,
Land of the free
But your parents still didn't know
She said "I've had a hell of a summer
So baby
Don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Girl if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway
It's love made in the you. S. A.

Don't let em front you
To saying you can't move without em
F**k em I tell em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began dude
Ain't gon' be trippin over some b***h a** dude
They so vain I tell em this ain't you
You kick it sensitive but this ain't true
These n****s can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do
That he can't do
That you can't do
That we can't do
Man I had a dream and then that s**t came true
And n***a if I did it I think you can too
These n****s can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do
That he can't do
That you can't do
That we can't do
Man I had a dream and then that s**t came true
These n****s can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do
That he can't do
That you can't do
