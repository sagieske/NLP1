Song:

I've been fumbling with your heart strings,
And that's good enough for me,
And if it rains over your house,
Then I know I must been working,
Try it on for size my darling,
See what a man you can make of me,
I will eventually haunt you,
Oh you'll eventually will be my queen,

And I'll be with you through
The dark so that you do not,
Go through the dark alone,
Or on your own

I've been down Biloxi Parish,
And that's all the same to me,
I found that nothing truly matters,
That you cannot find for free,
I love you more than can I tell you,
And when you pass through from this world,
I hope you ask to take me with you
So I won't have to wait too long

But until then I'll be with you through the dark,
Yes until then I'll be with you through the dark

And who else can say that about you, baby
Who else can say that about you, now
And who else can take all your blood and your curses
Nobody I've seen you hanging around
Seen ya hanging around

And all of our heroes with failures of ghosts
Burn down in brilliant explosions alone
And all of the blood and the sweat that they gave
Well we took it all and we threw it away

Who else can say that about you, baby
And who else can say that about you, now
And who else can take all your blood and your curses
Nobody I've seen ya hanging around

And who else can say that about you, baby
Who else can say that about you, now
And who else can say all your blood and your curses
Nobody I've seen a hanging around
Seen ya hanging around
