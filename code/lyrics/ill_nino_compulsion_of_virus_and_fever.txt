Song:

Paz
Encima las razas
With these eyes
From cielos above us
You're so fast
To cut to the chase
You'll be last
To win in this lifeless race

No more war
No more resolutions
Solutions are drowning
In puddles of weakness
And it has never rained like this

Son cosas de hermanos
Me labo las manos
Tu sabes muy bien

Rise

Dos
Por dos en la fila
In this show
Of virus and fever
You can live
With nada but stress
You will burn
In all of your useless waste

No more war
No more resolutions
Solutions are drowning
In puddles of weakness
And it has never rained like this
No more war
There is no solution
Unconscience we're drowning
In puddles of weakness
And all this rain will never cease

No more war
No more death
Everyone's drowning
In puddles of weakness

Rise

No more war
No more resolutions
Solutions are drowning
In puddles of weakness
And it has never rained like this
No more war
There is no solution
Unconscience we're drowning
In puddles of weakness
And all this rain will never cease
