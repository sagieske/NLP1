Song:

It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes

My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle

If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That angels brought me here

Standing here before you
Feels like I've been born again
Every breath is your love
Every heartbeat speaks your name
My dreams came true
Right here in front of you
My miracle

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That angels brought me here

Brought me here to be with you
I'll be forever grateful
Forever thankful
My dreams came true
When I found you
My miracle

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayer
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That angels brought me here

If you could see what I see
You're the answer to my prayer (Yes they brought me here)
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know
It would be clear
That angels brought me here
