Album: Silencer (2001)

When I wake up
Find it so hard to breathe
Time to take up
Because now I'm not even me

Fighting heaven fighting hard
But you're not listening to me
No...

Strike a zero
Unknown wants I can't see
You're my hero
Why don't I believe in me

Fighting heaven fighting hard
But you're not listening to me
No...

And I hear your voice, you're calling again
But there's no answer from me
And I hear your voice, you're calling again

Face the window
Time to set you free
Hear the wind blow
Making mockery of me

Fighting heaven fighting hard
But you're not listening to me
No...
