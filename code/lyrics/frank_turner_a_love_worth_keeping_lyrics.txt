Song:

Rise in the morning at sunrise
Strangers around me sleep soundly at rest
Phones and computers become me
Signals stretch back to the lands that I've left
Oh in the quiet times
Count up the things that I love
Slip through the road lights
The trail of wandering back

Left you while you were sleeping
Left you the warmth in the bed, where I lay
You left me a love worth keeping
You left me a diary to count off the days
And so in the quiet times
I saver the things that I've lost
And slip through the road lights
And wonder how I came to this

I guess you never know
Lost until you have something to lose
Choice until you have something to choose
Choose

So give me my quiet times
To mourn for the things that I've lost
And find me on the road lights
Counting the miles and the cost
So I never knew
Lost cos I had nothing to lose
Choice cos I had nothing to choose
But all the things you do
The way that you close your door
The way that you guard your shore
Darling, I'm coming home soon
