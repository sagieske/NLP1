Song:

Hope, 
A new beginning
Time, 
Time to start living
Like just before we die

There's no going back
To the place we started from

Hurt, 
Falling through fingers
Trust, 
Trust in the feeling
There's something left inside

There's no going back
To the place we started from

I... All secrets known... 

I... I... I... 

Calm, 
All wounds are healing
Strong, 
Truth is worth saving
I want to feel alive

There's no going back
To the place we started from

I... 

All secrets known...
