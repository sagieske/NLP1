Song:

I feel there's something on your mind every time I hold ya tight
When we kiss and say goodnight
I feel that something is wrong.

Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong

You say you don't like boys to pass, but it's the only way
I can look at you and say
Here in my arms is where you belong.

Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong
Am I coming on too strong
