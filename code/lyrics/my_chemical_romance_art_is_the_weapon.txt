Song:

Look alive, sunshine. One o' nine in the sky but the pigs won't quit.
You're here with me, Dr. Death Defying. I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter.
Pumpin' out the Slaughtermatic sounds to keep you live.
System failure for the masses; anti-matter for the master plan.
Louder than God's revolver and twice as shiny.
This one's for you rock'n'rollers. All you crash queens and motor babies. Listen up! The future is bulletproof; the aftermath secondary.
It's time to do it now and do it loud.
Killjoys make some noise!

From mall security,
To every enemy
We're on your property,
Standing in V formation

Drop like a bullet shell,
Dress like a sleeper cell.
I'd rather go to hell,
Than be in purgatory

Cut my hair,
Gag and bore me,
Pull this pin,
Let this world explode.
