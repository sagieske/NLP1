Song:

I'm all alone tonight
Waitin' for the sun to shine
Starin' all over again
I'm breaking away
Looking to the other way
Where life could be much better

Will I ever let you bring me down
Now itsover, I'm finally moving on
I won't let you, let you bring me down

I've finally seen the light
Thought that I was larger than life
But it's all just wishful thingking
I; m taking flight on the brighter side
Cause life just don't come easy

Will I ever let you bring me down
Now it's over, I'm finally movin on
I won't let you... Bring me down

Bring me down
Bring me down

Will I ever let you bring me down
Now it's over, I'm finally movin on
I wont let you... Bring me down

Will I ever let you bring me down
Now it's over, I'm finally movin on
I won't let you... Bring me down
