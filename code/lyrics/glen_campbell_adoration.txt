Song:

Adoration, adoration
Baby, when will you get your fill
Adulation, adulation
You know baby, I don't think you ever will

You're always talkin' about just livin' for the moment
An' bein' a romantic in you, you talk about freedom
But you don't know what freedom is
No, you don't know where freedom lives

You, you don't know, exactly what you feel
No you, you don't know, exactly what is real
But I'm gonna show you how it feels
To feel goodbye

Desolation, desolation
You finally brought it down to the same foreground
Desperation, desperation
You don't know how crazy you sound

You're always talkin' about, my like of class
The way I, hold my glass
And even though the way I smoke and
Lord, I didn't even smoke, Lord, I didn't even smoke

But I, I met you and you had to change my hair
And I, I met you and you had to show me what to wear
But I'm gonna show you how it feels
To feel goodbye
