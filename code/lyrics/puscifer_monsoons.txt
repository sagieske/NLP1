Song:

Valley heat is rising
Believe us
Long as hell to heaven
Believe us

Valley heat is rising
Relieve us
Long as hell to heaven
Relieve us

Dry desert touches sky
Prayer for deliverance from up high
And pray the sky will understand
And cry and pour the emotion down

Only you can bring the color in
You alone bring hope into our world

The patient pleading ground
Without you, brittle, gray and brown

Only you can bring the color in
So wine vine can carry on

Pray the sky will understand
And cry emotion pouring down

Only you can bring the color in
So wine vine can carry on the day
