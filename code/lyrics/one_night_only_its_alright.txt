Song:

Should I stay, should I go, I can't make up my mind anymore
She's walking round the corner, I've got my back to the wall

Yes you're telling me, it's alright, it's alright
Yes you're telling me, it's fine, it's alright

Life is like a jigsaw, sometimes it's all over the floor
When the pieces fit together, you feel a thing you've never felt before

You're telling me it's alright, it's alright
Yes you're telling me, it's fine, it's alright

Who's that banging on my door?
I look outside the sky's painted the floor
I think were safe I think were fine
The moments here, the feelings right, it's alright
