[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
She says I'm cold
Only time I'm comfortable kissing is sending X and Os
I send a message back to dispute this fact, but this I know
I hope to find my love, like we used to before dial-up
Whatever happened to our phone s**?
Right now, can't think of anything we don't text
I broke her heart on the email
I'm so cold, I'ma just spare y'all the details
I can't even tell y'all whats real
I got an itouch, but I can't feel

[Bridge 1]
Past was the word, now I'm living in the future

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Start mackin' on my black berry, she got jealous I was tappin' on my Blackberry
So she didn't keep in touch and I can't tell the difference, we ain't see each other much
Aside from some late night texts, a couple Os, a few Xs
My current feels just like my exes, different characters, same letters
Red light, another message, spilling her heart out, what a mess this is
P. S., this is B. S., I can't even spell it out, am I that unaffectionate?

[Bridge 2: Jay-Z] x6
I don't know how I feel
Somebody tell me what's real

[Bridge 1]
Past was the word, now I'm living in the future

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
She said it got better and worser
And it's supposed to be vice-versa
I don't know, I kinda like this surf stuff
We used to see tears when we hurt stuff
I guess it got faster but colder
We ichat, that's how she comes over
That's better than not seeing her
And I'm so glad I'm serving her like Serena
She can YouTube in the arena
And we close, no matter how many miles between us
I told her, "Welcome to the future"
That's just how it is, I'm a user
