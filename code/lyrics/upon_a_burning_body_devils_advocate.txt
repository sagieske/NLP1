Song:

If you had to ask me how hard it must be to walk the path that I have
Chosen, then you're already to weak to even try

You don't have the heart
The struggle, the sacrifice, this is the only thing I know
It's complicated, some say it's overrated
This is happening all because of you
This is the dream they said we would never have
Never have
Countless years
We've sacrificed everything to spread the infection
Spread the infection

Yeah
So bang your head
Would you fight for what they say is already dead to the point of suffering
This is the path where you don't have to die to go through hell
This is the birth of hate and death of love
We will decimate the human race
Creating the words of your salvation
Welcome to a new age, a rebirth

This is
This is the birth of hate
It's too late for your salvation
So who the f**k is laughing now?

The struggle, the sacrifice, this is the only thing I know
It's complicated, some say it's overrated
This is happening because of you
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
Freedom baby is never having to say you're sorry
So when the fix is on at full strength and you cannot stop your hands from
Shaking, whose side will you choose?
