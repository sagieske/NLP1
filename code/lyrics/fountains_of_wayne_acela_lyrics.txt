Song:

There's a train on a track
Painted silver, blue and black
Heading to Massachusetts
And then it's coming back

And it's entertaining by New Haven
Once you've had yourself a drink or two, ooh ooh
All alone on the Acela
Tell me baby, where the hell are you?
(Acela) Ooh ooh (Acela)

There's a girl on a train
Leaning on a window pane
Reading People magazine
Just to help turn off her brain

And I swear I caught her staring at me
Maybe I've been staring at her too, ooh ooh
Shot to hell on the Acela
Just as well there's nothing else to do
(Acela) Ooh ooh (Acela)

When they come all aboard
You were nowhere to be found
Though you swore you were sure
You'd come with me out of town

And I looked at all the stars
I looked in huts and news
Searched for any sign of you
But you had not left any clues
I was so confused
What was I supposed to do?

Now the world is a blur
And the engine starts to purr
And we're flying through Rhode Island
The conductor calls me "sir"

For your information hits South Station
At about 11:22 (ooh, ooh)
Got to get the next Acela
Got to make my way back home to you
Got to get the next Acela
Got to get myself back home to you
(Acela, Acela)
