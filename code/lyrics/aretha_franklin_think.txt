Song:

Think (think) think (think) think (think)think (think) you think (think)
Think (think) think about it

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you, you couldn't have been too much more than ten
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degree
It don't take too much high iq's to see what you're doing to me

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

Hey, think about it
You, think about it

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, to keep doing things I don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

People walking around everyday, playing games that they can score
And I ain't gonna be the losing my way, ah, be careful you don't lose yours

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without each other there ain't nothing people can do

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, if you're doing things I don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without eachother there ain't nothing people can do, yeah yeah
Think about me (what your trying to do to me) till the fall of night
Think about it right now

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

Hey, you think about it,

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, if you're doing things I don't

Yeah, think (think) think about what your trying to do to me, baby, think, let your mind go let your self be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without eachother there ain't nothing people can do, yeah, yeah
Think about me (what your trying to do to me) till the fall of night
Think about it baby

(think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about it)

(think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about it)

(think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about it)

(think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about what your doing to me, think about it)

You had better stop and think before you think, think!!
