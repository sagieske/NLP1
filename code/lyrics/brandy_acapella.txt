Song:

Boom, clap! (6x)
Clap!

Verse 1:
I'm feeling such a vacancy,
I don't feel whole (oh oh)
Wish I could put my finger on it but
I don't know what it is
I looked in every place I could seek
Tried to find the missing part of me
I can't explain this feeling (feeling)

Chorus:
Feels like
I'm on the wrong journey
Going in circles
And I ain't even going nowhere
I'm lost
In the middle of nowhere
Something is missing
Can't somebody help me?
Something is missing
I'm missing a part of me
Something is missing
Show me what it is
Show me what's missing
Missing

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Boom, clap! (4x)
Clap!

Verse 2:
I'm in the dark room
In a bad position
I'm looking for the light
To restore my vision (vision)
'Cause I'm walking down
Looking for a door,
I can't find my way
I can't explain this feeling

Chorus

Feels like I'm leaving something behind
Can't think straight, something's on my mind
Can't pretend to 'cause I'm all so broke
Can't find the words 'cause they've all been spoke
The answer's gonna be right in my face, oh oh
What I'm gonna do to fill this empty space, oh oh oh

Chorus (2x)
