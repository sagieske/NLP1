Song:

please lend us your ears and eyes
for we can be free in this the season of our discontent
unlawful are we for we seek the forbidden fruit
we seek the forbidden truth
the storm is coming
and the tide is high and so are we
we are wide open
acceptance is not as powerful as submission
so we smile in face of the enemy
smile in the face of adversity
eyes glazed under a half lit world
we grow
we move
we explore the unknown reaching towards the answer to our self's
we are free to die
exhale and fly
into the sun
raising
floating
changing (?)
makes you
?
shapeing
leaves you waiting
so face yourself
so face yourself
and see
the ugly truth that lives underneath
so face
so face yourself
so face yourself
so face yourself
?
there no denying reason
there no denying purpose
follow the sun
follow the sun
there no denying reason
there no denying purpose
follow the sun
follow the sun
there no denying reason
there no denying purpose
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow the sun
follow
follow
so face yourself
so face yourself
