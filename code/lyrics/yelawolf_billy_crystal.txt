Verse 1:
Trailer parks on fire
Billy been cookin up somethin
If you need a biscuit, come on then
Billy just got it jumpin
Get it from a pro
Get it for the low
Get you some blow
Get it for the nose
Get it for the show
Get it for the hoes
Four wheeler cranked up
Gas tank on the atv
Is full of that crank but
Billy got pills from A to Z
So whaddya think bud
Billy wont go below 50
22's are dangerous
Drink the thing up with the nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle
How you feelin now?
Purple moons and lucky charms
Yeah that's the sound
But veins turnin brown
But his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun
They goin Billy now

Chorus:
Billys on the corner with the crystal meth
And he aint slowin down, slowin down
Billys on the corner with the crystal meth
Go Billy! Crystal meth
Ay, oh, ay, oh, oh, ay, oh

Hello junkies
And hello momma too
Hello to my P. O.
Deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls
20 pounds on the catwalk
Lsd and adderal
And lcds on the wall
He's watchin every move
High-tech redneck
Run up on him if ya want to
I bet, really, come on
It might be dark in the woods
But the lights are on
The moneys counted
And if the price is wrong
Well then Billy will get them gremlins like speilberg
He'll take your house down, off of them pillars
And take your mom to sizzler
And feed her chicken liver
That's cold blooded love
Billys a killer

Chorus

4: 30 in the A. M.
Billy aint slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit
Gotta keep up with the craze
It's a heavy shade
Gotta walk through the maze
Down where the sun don't shine
And the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew
And the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy
And up come an able male
Momma stayed at work
Daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck
But ya gotta play with what your dealt
So Billy dealt the joker
Put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober
And pissed at a super soaker
And he wet em all up
And left his snow yellow
That's hard life
Boy for the ellow

Chorus
