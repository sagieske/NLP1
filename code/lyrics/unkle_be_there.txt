Song:

You don't wanna go there
Let me lead you by the hand
You don't wanna be there
Over the sea and down to land

As I look into your eyes
I pay no mind
I found the way
To get inside you
Id give you peace of mind

Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling beautiful
The same

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometimes

You don't wanna go there
Let me lead you by the hand
You don't wanna be there
Over the sea and down to land

As I look into your eyes
I pay no mind
I found the way
To get inside you
Id give you peace of mind

Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling beautiful
The same

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometimes

Here and again
And there youre
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling

Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling beautiful
The same

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometimes

Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling?
Am I see you falling beautiful
The same

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometimes

Falling, falling, free

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,

Corrupt, a plea for free will
An irresponsible harass show
It has been suggested
That this contradictory
