Song:

I breathe
I hear
But I don't believe it

My heart
It beats
But inside I'm freezing

My hands
They shake
I've lost all the feeling

Nowhere
To take
You say that you're leaving

And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone
Where do I turn when we weren't so close
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried
I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm stripped
I'm bare
I'm left here with nothing

I hold
The wheel
Don't know where I'm going

Your face
I see
In every reflection

No time
No space
I've lost all direction

And there's no turning back this time
Gotta stay alive

Where do I go when I'm so alone
Where do I turn when we weren't so close
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried
I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm gonna get there someway
Through all the tears and the rain
And any road I can take
Just to get me some place

Where all the scars on my heart
And all the lies in the dark
Disappear in the headlights
So bright, tonight, gonna drive them away

Where do I go when I'm so alone
Where do I turn when we weren't so close
We try not to crash but we still collide
Tears I've cried
I'll survive
I'm alive

I'm alive [x3]
Ooh

I'm alive
