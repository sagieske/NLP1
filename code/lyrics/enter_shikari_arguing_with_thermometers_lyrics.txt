Song:

This is an expedition,
Into the Arctic tundra!
This is a sickening mission, Yeah!
Just to spoil and plunder!

That's the sound of another door shutting in,
In the face of progress, in the face of progress.
They'll plant their flags, in the sea bed.
Shackleton is rolling in his grave...
That's the sound of another door shutting in,
In the face of progress, in the face of progress.
They'll plant their flags, in the sea bed.
Shackleton is rolling in his grave.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're all addicted the the most abused and destructive drug
Of all time,
And I ain't talking about class A's â€“ that business is just miniscule when
Compared!
And just like any addict desperate to get his next fix,
We resort to committing crimes to secure our next hit!

You know there's oil in the ice!
You know there's oil in my eyes!
You know there's blood on my hands!
Yeah! We're all addicted!
Yeah! We're all dependent!
That's maniac standpoint!
Psychotic outlook.
That's maniac standpoint!
Psychotic outlook.

That's the sound of another door shutting in,
In the face of progress, in the face of progress.
They'll plant their flags, in the sea bed.
Shackleton is rolling in his grave...
That's the sound of another door shutting in,
In the face of progress, in the face of progress.
They'll plant their flags, in the sea bed.
Shackleton is rolling in his grave.

So lemme get this straight; as we witness the ice-caps melt,

Instead of being spurred into changing our ways,

We're gonna invest into military hardware to fight for the remaining oil that's
Left beneath the ice!

But what happens when it's all gone! You haven't thought this through,
Have you boys!

We'll take you down!
We'll take you down!
We'll take you down!
Stand your ground!

You know there's oil in the ice!
You know there's oil in my eyes!
You know there's blood on my hands!
Yeah! We're all addicted!
Yeah! We're all dependent!
That's maniac standpoint!
Psychotic outlook.
That's maniac standpoint!
Psychotic outlook.

Back to the drawing board boys,
Accept nothing short of complete reversal.
Dig deep!
