Song:

Sitting in a Russian bath-house on Avenue B,
No matter how much we sweat we just can't agree.
[Ukrainian]
Nobody learn no nothing from no history.

Oh Sally with the magic pebbles,
Now she sells equipment to the Chechen rebels.
[Ukrainian]
[Ukrainian]
[Ukrainian]
[Ukrainian]
Sitting in the bath-house on Avenue B,
And never agree.

Sally all empires fall, even trends they fade away,
Even company strangers, can lead you astray.
But goddammit, this round is on me,
Nobody learns no nothing from no history.

Oh little Sally my darling, your panic so charming,
Your shopping techniques are amazing, celebrity erudition disarming.
Oh little Sally my darling, your panic so charming,
Oh little Sally my darling... Yuri Lemeshev!
(Yuri Lemeshev!)

Sitting in a Russian bath-house on Avenue B,
No matter how much we sweat we just can't agree.
[Ukrainian]
Not me, not you!
