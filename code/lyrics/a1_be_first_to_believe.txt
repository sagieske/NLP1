Song:

Ben: love leads to laughter
Love leads to pain,
With you by my side
I feel good times again.

Mark: never have I felt
These feelings before,
You showed me the world
How could I ask for more.

Christian: and although there's confusion
We'll find a solution
To keep my heart close to you.

Paul: and I know, yes I know,
If you hold me, believe me
I'll never, never ever leave.

All: and I know,
There is nothing that I would not do for you
Forever be true.
And I know,
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
I'm forever in love with you.

Ben: show me affection
In all different ways
Give you my heart
For the rest of my days.

Mark: with you all my troubles
Are left far behind
Like heaven on earth
When I look in your eyes.

Christian: and although there's confusion
We'll find a solution
To keep my heart close to you.

Paul: and I know, yes I know,
If you hold me, believe me
I'll never, never ever leave.

All: and I know,
There is nothing that I would not do for you
Forever be true.
And I know,
Although times can be hard
We will see it through
I'm forever in love with you.

Christian: no need to cry,
I'll be right by your side.

All: (right by your side)

Paul: let's take our time
Love won't run dry
If you hold me, believe me
I'll never, never ever leave. (intro-hook)
