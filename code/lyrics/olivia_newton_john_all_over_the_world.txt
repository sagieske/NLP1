Song:

Everybody all around the world
Gotta tell you what I just heard
There's gonna be a party all over the world

I got a message on the radio
But where it came from I don't really know
And I heard these voices calling all over the world

All over the world,
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

Everybody walkin' down the street
Everybody movin' to the beat
They're gonna get hot down in the you. S. A.
(New York, Detroit, L. A.)

We're gonna take a trip across the sea
Everybody come along with me
We're gonna hit the night down in g** Pareee

All over the world,
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

[Instrumental]

London, Hamburg, Paris, Rome, Rio, Hong Kong, Tokyo
L. A., New York, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Shard End and

All over the world,
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

Everybody all around the world
Gotta tell you what I just heard
Everybody walkin' down the street
I know a place where we all can meet
Everybody gonna have a good time
Everybody will shine till the daylight

All over the world,
Everybody got the word
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight

All over the world
Everybody got the word
All over the world
Everybody got the word
All over the world
Everybody got the word
