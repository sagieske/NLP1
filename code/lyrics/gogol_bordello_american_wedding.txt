Song:

Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka, where's marinated herring?
Where is the band that's got the taste?
Where is the supply that gonna last three days?
Where is the band that like Fanfare.
Gonna keep it goin' 24 hours

Ta-tar-ranta-ta-ta
Super taran-ta taran-ta ran-ta ta

Instead it's one in the mornin'
And dj is patchin' up the cords
Everybody's full of cake
Staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble
That it's time to do
People gotta get up early
Yep, they gotta go
People gotta get up early
And she'd gotta boyfriend
And this whole f*****g thing
Is one huge disappointment

Ta-tar-ran-ta

Nothing gets these b*****s going
Not even Gypsy Kings
Nobody talks about my Supertheory
Of Supereverythings!
So be you Donald Trump
Or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding
Doesn't end up like this

I understand the cultures
Of a different kind
But here word celebration
Just doesn't come to mind
