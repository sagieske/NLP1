Song:

This is as good a place to fall as any
We'll build our altar here
Make me your Maria
I'm already on my knees

You had Jesus on your breath
And I caught Him in mine
Sweating out confessions
The undone and the divine

'Cause this is his body, this is his love
Such selfish prayers and I can't get enough, oh

Yeah, I can't get enough

Spilled milk tears, I did this for you
Spilling over the idol, the black and the blue
The sweetest submission, drinking it in
The wine and the women, the bedroom hymns

'Cause this is body, this is his love
Such selfish prayers and I can't get enough

I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough

I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I've found myself an old solution
I'm not here looking for absolution
Because I've found myself an old solution

This is his body, this is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough
This is his body, oh, this is his love
Such selfish prayers, I can't get enough

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Yeah, I can't get enough
