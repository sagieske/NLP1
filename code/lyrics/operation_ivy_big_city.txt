Song:

Concrete and chaos rise up
Spiderweb across the land
Like a giant rash
Forests lie down below
Foundations of buildings in a bed of ash

Some people here got it real good
Cuz the glass towers bring prosperity
Other people starve in the street
Because concrete knows no sympathy

Big city it's a wishing well
Big city it's a living hell

This town it's f*****g insane
How one will starve and another will gain
Like a giant mechanical brain
And the people are cells and the streets are veins
It thinks only of itself

A thousand limbs crawling as it expands and grows
And still the concrete sits there
Sits there stark grey and cold
And I think I wanna be a brick layer
So I can put another brick in the wall
Its sanitary rational happy and sane
Growing like a flower to surround us all
