Song:

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Can't beat me I'm a show sharp winner
One of a kind, I'm original
I'm so ill, I'm gonna need a painkiller
Stealing the show like a criminal

Don't fight for the non-believers
Give a little and you might get some
This one's for the non-believers
All together now everyone, go!

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
Cause' I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Both hands tied and I get gold medals
Still alive and I'm going hard
Make my mark and I'm breaking all records
You know me, I'm a superstar

Don't fight for the non-believers
Give a little and you might get some
This one's for the non-believers
All together now everyone, go!

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
Cause' I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

Like it ain't been done
Like it, like it ain't been done
Like it ain't been, like it ain't been, like it ain't been
Done, done, done
Like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
On top only just begun
Better believe I'll be your number one
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
And I hope you're holding on
Cause' I'm gone, gone, gone
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
Better believe I'll be your number one
And I hope you're holding on
'Cause I'm gone, gone, gone

I'm a do it like it ain't been done
I'm a do it like it ain't been done
