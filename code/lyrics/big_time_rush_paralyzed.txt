Song:

You, you walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon
That's when I saw you for the first time
And I was paralyzed

I had a million things to say
But none of them came out that day
'Cause I was never one of those guys
That always had the best lines

Time stops ticking
My hands keep shaking
And you don't even know that

I'm trying to speak but girl you got me tongue-tied
I'm trying to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I'm trying to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't fall into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

Now, I learned a lot from my mistake
Never let a good thing slip away
I found a lot of time to look back
And my only regret is

Not telling you what I was going through
You didn't even know that

I'm trying to speak but girl you got me tongue-tied
I'm trying to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I'm trying to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't fall into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

As the years go by I think about you all the time
Woah
If I get the chance I hope I won't be paralyzed
Paralyzed by you

You walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon

I'm trying to speak but girl you got me tongue-tied
I'm trying to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I'm trying to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
(You got me paralyzed)
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't fall into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
(You got me paralyzed)

Paralyzed, paralyzed
(You got me tongue tied)
Paralyzed, paralyzed
(Now I'm frozen inside)
Paralyzed, paralyzed
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
