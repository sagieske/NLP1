Song:

Oh I built a world around you
Oh you had me in a dream, I lived in every word you said
The stars had aligned
I thought that I found you
And I don't wanna love somebody else

Oh we left it all unspoken
Oh we buried it alive and now it's screaming in my head
Oh I shouldn't go on hoping
Oh that you will change your mind and one day we could start again
Well I don't care if loneliness kills me
I don't wanna love somebody else

Oh I thought that I could change you
Oh I thought that we would be the greatest story that I tell
I know that it's time to tell you it's over
But I don't wanna love somebody else
