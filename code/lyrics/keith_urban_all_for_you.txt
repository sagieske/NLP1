Song:

Last night I fell asleep, and I saw you dancing in my dreams,
Just like the way the Autumn leaves fall for you.
All for you.

You changed my life, you changed my ways.
I don't even recognize myself these days.
It must be a reflection of you.
Only you.

[Chorus:]
I can't remember feeling love like this, I'm so alive.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.

My arms could hold you tight, keep you warm in the coldest night.
My hand would pull your hair right back away from your eyes.
For you. Only you.
If I knew how to do it,
I'd paint the moon, the stars around you.
Paint the perfect sunset.
But I couldn't make it more beautiful than you.
Oh, nothing compares to you.
You know it's true.

[Chorus:]
I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.
It's so true, I'm all for you.

[Chorus:]
I can't remember feeling love like this in so long.
I can't imagine living life without you by my side.
Day after day you find a way to make this grown man cry.

Some might call it insanity.
Without a doubt for the rest of my life,
I'm going to be crazy.
Baby, crazy for you.

All for you.
I'm all for you.
