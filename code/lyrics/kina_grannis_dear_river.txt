Song:

Holding on dear river to my skin
Whispering the places you have been
And I look back upstream

Everybody knows the river comes
The river goes but you stopped here
You stopped here for me
You took my heart in tow
How could I let you go

I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you
I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you

Rolling on dear river does it end
I saw you though the canyon and the bend
Did you look back for me

I could fight the flow
And tug of war the undertow
But I’d never not ever succeed
So when you’re out to sea
I hope you think of me

I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you
I doubt anyone can keep up
Keep up, keep up
Keep up, keep up with you

Just keep on river gone is my friend
Just keep on river gone is my
Just keep on river gone is my friend
Just keep on river gone is my
