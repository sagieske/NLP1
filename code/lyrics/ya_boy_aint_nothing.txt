Song:

It ain't nothing, ain't nothing to me
I be doing shit they'd never believe
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot
Nah, it ain't nothing, pop bottles and blow trees
And get a bottle of oz
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot

I ain't mess, fly nigga, jet zone
High when I pass, blowing gas on that, 
Niggas on my level they must be top floor
On top of the world getting top from your girl
Living life like it's new to me
22's on that whip boy that shit look like brand new shoes to me
Just writing my 8's and a half, or my nines
That's dimes in them little green bag, I blow it all
Go cop and show it all
Give money to my girl she gonna give it to the mall
Got a niggaz zoning, eyes red like a break light on a late night
Like I'm coning
There's something about that swag you got, the, 
They can't figure
And ain't nothing just to flash what I got
I can show, platinum nigga

It ain't nothing, ain't nothing to me
I be doing shit they'd never believe
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot

Nah, it ain't nothing, pop bottles and blow trees
And get a bottle of oz
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot

Guess who's, still smell the money on my finger tips
Riding with a single bitch
Boy I let the, speech, serve you like Serena bitch
Man I got a benz Bentley and a beemer chick
Fly nigga quick like my nigga Swift
And I wrap a nigga up no Christmas gift
While I beat a rock turned like Waka Flocka
Whole squad push kicks like we playing soccer
No talking, cut back nigga, block a blocka
I swear you dealing with a monster, Chewbacca
Girl I rep kill... to my dying day
And if I ain't a real nigga let me die today
, got us playing with power positions
Let them ak's squirt like a pile of syringes
Bitch bout, wings spread like a butterfly
I'm getting money, I ain't nothing like them other guys
It ain't nothing nigga

It ain't nothing, ain't nothing to me
I be doing shit they'd never believe
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot
Nah, it ain't nothing, pop bottles and blow trees
And get a bottle of oz
I be thinking it ain't none, look at all that I got
See I did made it happen, cause I, see a lot.
