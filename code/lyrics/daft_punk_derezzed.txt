Song:

Don't want to let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh let it pass me by

I don't want to miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't want to miss a thing
Your love is so amazing

Don't want to let you go
I'm staying here by your side
Wish time was standing still
Don't wanna close my eyes
And let this night pass me by
Oh let it pass me by

I don't want to miss a thing
Your love is so amazing, so amazing
If we could spend forever
Live forever, that's alright with me
I don't want to miss a thing
Your love is so amazing
