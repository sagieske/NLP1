Song:

Now that you're older and girl I'm older too (yeah yeah)
Baby I'll still have those feelings, those feelings for you
Cause you are all that matters to me
You're all that matters (all that matters to love)
You're all that matters to love
(all that matters to me without your love where would I be?)
Where would I be? Where would I be?
Girl can't you see, I'm so close to surrender
This lady has changed, from the girl I remember
Now you're all that I could ever dream and more
This is a lifetime of love I'm so sure
Cause you are all that matters to me, You are all that matters to love
You are all that matters to me, Without your love where would I be
Baby I found mmm, a dream that's making me stronger (making me stronger)
I've looked and I've realised, that noone's taking me from ya
Now you gave me more than all my dreams come true
Where would I be now baby without you?

Now you are all that I could ever dream and more
And baby you know that this is a life time of love I'm sure
Life time of love
You know that baby it's a life time (baby it's a life time) of love, It's a life time of love
