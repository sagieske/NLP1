Song:

On the road so long and lonely
can't believe I'm headed home to stay
God I miss my one and only
a little traveling music please
seems we're always seperating
still she doesn't let me lose my way
home is anywhere she's waiting
a little traveling music please
I may forget how much I care
but once I've left her laughter
two and three days after
I'm aware how much I miss her there
this time I'll stay home forever
hold her close and turn the world away
even if it's not forever
it it'll keep me from unraveling
a little traveling music please
two and three days after
I'm aware how much I miss her there
this time I'll stay home forever
hold her close and turn the world away
even if it's not forever
she's going to keep me from unraveling
a little traveling music please
a little traveling music please
