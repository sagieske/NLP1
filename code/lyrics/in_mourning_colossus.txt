Song:

New moon awakening. Casting light upon a dream
And it starts haunting, the storm building up
The spirits are awakening, losing hours to the ghost
And then the rain, it came crushing down.

Falling rocks leave the wounded ground, in the doorway the stood.
The ghosts are whispering their name, no sleep,
Colossus is calling.

Destined to swallow the shore, the depths splits the surface
Raised it's cold hands to the sky to become controller of earth and wood.

A constellation of stars embodied, descent to walk among the pale.
Colossus colliding, the coral giant strides along the shore
