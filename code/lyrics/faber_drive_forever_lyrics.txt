Song:

We were seventeen
But everything still seemed so clear to me
Whispering and watching falling stars
From my beat up car
(I was fallin', fallin' I was fallin')

In the parking lot
Almost 10 o'clock
We went for one last walk
I couldn't stop
Thinkin' if I should try
A kiss goodbye
(I was fallin', fallin' I was fallin')

I'll wait forever
It's better late then never
Can't forget her
Like a movie in my mind
Keeps playing over and over
Wanna hold her again
I'll wait forever

Time goes by but still I find
Can't keep you off my mind
A broken piece of me I left behind
When you were mine
(I was fallin', fallin' I was fallin')

Our last embrace
Those perfect tears fell down your perfect face
Your lips said words that I just can't erase
Was this a waste?
(You were fallin', fallin' you were fallin')

I'll wait foreverIt's better late then never
Can't forget her
Like a movie in my mind
Keeps playing over and over
Wanna hold her again

I kept her letter in my wallet
And her picture in my phone
She had our favourite song set as her ringtone
We had everything we wanted'
Till we let it slip away
But we both know some things will never change

Time goes by
But still I find
I can't keep you off my mind... 
I'll wait forever
It's better late then never
Can't forget her
Like a movie in my mind
Keeps playing over and over
Wanna hold her, I'll wait forever
I'll wait forever
It's better late then never
Can't forget her
Like a movie in my mind
Keeps playing over and over
