Song:

I'll tell you a story
'Bout a man that I loved
He lives in the sky
In the clouds above
He knows every river
Every mountain and stream
He's a gentleman, I tell you,
That lives in my dream
If you don' t believe
What I say is true
Maybe someday he will happen to you
It's like he's always watching over me
I do believe in magic
When it's plain to see
If you don't believe
What I say is true
Maybe someday he will happen to you
Softly he whispers into my ear
The dream is over, but I don't wanna hear
No, no, no, no
Softly he whispers into my ear
The dream is over, but I don't wanna hear
So, take me, I' m lonely
Take me in your dreams
Please don't leave me waiting here
As long as it seems
If you don't believe
What I say is true
Maybe, baby, someday he will happen to you
Softly he whispers into my ear
The dream is over, but I don't wanna hear
But I don't wanna hear...I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna...I don't wanna hear...
