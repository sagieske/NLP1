Song:

Boiling Point
What no shame
Broken Dreams
What no shame
I have come for you
Since I was to die
Boil to unknown sights
Make believe broken dreams
Broken dreams
Boiling point
Point of no return
Fears and dreams disguise
Lifes noose
Can I
Face the chair
(electric chair I assume)
Face the chair
Face the chair
Boiling point
What no shame
Falling to darkness
Where the sky turns red
Turns into stark features
Letting you wish you would live
You wish you would live
Boiling point
What no shame
Boiling point
Broken dreams
What no shame
