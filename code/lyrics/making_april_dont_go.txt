Song:

It seems the moments went so fast
I couldn't bask in one for long before it passed
And now they slip right by
And my thoughts, they're craving you and I
No they don't have us no, not anymore
You journey back to our hometown
We spend an evening graced with all our sights and sounds
But the morning breaks our high
When you say, it was only one more night
(Don't go cause I made it through goodbye
Now I'll make it better
I know we needed a little time to our lives
And I believed that you would never make it back
I take it back baby
But now that you're here)
Don't go
The broken sidewalk looked like states
I stood on tennessee and begged for you to stay
But you kept your eyes down low
And you took the colorado's home
[Chorus:]
Don't leave me stranded on the street
We used to meet that split between our houses
I don't wanna go back alone, no
Don't go cause we made it through the night
Now we'll make it better
I know we needed a little time to our lives
And I believed that you would never make it back
I take it back baby
Now that you're here
Don't go
No don't you go, no don't you go
Cause I made it through goodbye
Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh
Now I'll make it better
