[Ninja]
Our father
Who art in heaven
Please watch over me
24/7
Please give me
Something to believe in
I'm either driven or crippled by these demons
Sometimes it feels like the power I wield is a blessing and a curse
And I wanna shine up on my brothers like the sun
But when my light is gone
Change to be ugly
I wanna be happy I don't wanna hurt the ones I love
They the ones who only getting hurt the most
Please send your angels
To save me from myself

I wanna feel free
I wanna feel please
Well I can feel pleased
If I'm feeling guilty
Please forgive me
For all my sins please
And forgive them who keep sinning against me
May my enemies live long so they can see me progress
I know that my biggest enemy is me and that pain is weakness leaving my body
And if I dance with the devil in the pale moonlight it's alright
But deliver me from evil with my soul intact
And no regrets
Amen
