Song:

Carolyn let me tell you what I heard bout a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city bright in a night time like day
There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb dripped with honey
And something about the smell of strange perfume
Made him feel warm and not alone.

Yes Carolyn. A man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home.

--- Instrumental ---

Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own
And sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe a man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always
When he's treated bad at home...
