[Chris Brown]
I don't see how you can hate 
From outside the club you
Can't even get in, Leggo

Yellow model chick
Yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini
Yellow top missing
Yeah yeah
That shit look like a toupee

I get what you get in 10 years, in two days
Ladies love me
I'm on my cool J
If you get what I get fuck what you say
She wax it all off, Mr Miyagi
And them suicide doors, Hari Kari

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthafucker

Lil nigga bigger than gorilla
Cause I'm killing every nigga that
Try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her
I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Ooops, I said on my dick
I aint really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm Done

[Busta Rhymes]
Ayo Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When your doing that thing over there, homie
Lets go
Cause I feel like I'm running
And I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop cause
You know I gotta win everyday day, goooo
See they don't ever really wanna pop me
Just know that you never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky, nooo
You aint never gonna stop me
Everytime I come a nigga gotta set it then I gotta go 
And then I gotta get it, than I gotta blow, 
Than I gotta shudder any little thing
A nigga think that he be doing cause it doesn't matter cause I'm gonna 
Dadadadada then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing I gotta do a lot of things, and make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I'm always winning and I gotta get it again and again and again
And I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
A nigga better call a rep and everybody know my style
And niggas know that I'm the the best
When it come to doing this and I'm banging on my chest
And I bang in the east and I bang in the west
And I come to give you more and I never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next, lets go
See the way we on, we be all up in the race and you know
We gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
We struggling and hustling and sending in and getting in
And always gotta do it take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it, have it

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, fresh than a muthafucker

[Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these bitch ass niggas how yall doin?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance, I go stupid, I go dumb like the 3 stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas aint eatin, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot em, and I said ok, 
If you wanted bullshit then I'm like olay, 
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch I'm outta my mind from the bottom I climb
You aint hotter at mine, nope, not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's poppin Slime? nothin five, and if they trippin fuck em five
I aint got no time to shuck and jive, these niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and sprite on a private flight
Bitch I'm enticing, guiding light, and my pockets rite and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared cause I'm too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial I puts it down
I'm so young money if you got eyes look at me now bitch

[Hook]
Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I'm getting paper
Look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Yeah, I'm fresher than a muthafucker

Okay, Okay, Is that right, I'm fresher than a muthha Fukka.!
