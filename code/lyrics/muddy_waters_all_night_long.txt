Song:

I want you to rock me, baby, after the sun goes down
I want you to rock me, mama, after the sun go
I want you to hug and kiss me, tell me you always be mine

I want you to throw your arms around me
Like a circle round the sun
I want you to throw your arms around me
Like a circle round the sun
I want you to call me daddy, oh yeah
And let the world know
