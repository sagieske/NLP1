Song:

Listen close to hooves you hear
Are thunders coming dread
John the Revelator's dream
Had seen a terror vision
Of the spirit led
With wrath to reign
And with slaves to flame
They kneeled and sealed a kiss
Plagues and pain and fiery rain
And blaspheme on his lips

Babylon's a-burning, Babylon's a-burning
Six hundred 6, 6 and 7 seals
A pale rider and his horses sing
Babylon's a-burning, Babylon's a-burning
Six hundred 6, 6 the rising beast
Bears the mark of Babylon to be

Arising with the beast a sea of men
A bloody moon of red
A w***e of Babylon to bleed the seed
And make 'em take the mark upon their heads

They bowed and kneeled a mark to seal
Their souls unto a kiss
With fire and flames and with
Souls to claim
And rise from the abyss

[Revelation 13]
And I stood upon the sand of the sea
And saw a beast rise out of the sea
Having ten horns and seven heads
Ten crowns upon his head
Who is like unto the beast?
Given his mouth great things to speak
If any man has an ear
Let him hear, let him hear
