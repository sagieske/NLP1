Song:

Aliester Crowley
And Bar Shem Tov
Are lyin' in the alley
Too stoned to move
Them and Aristotle
Are playin' swy
For one tiny bottle
Of Bal-a-Versailles
Over the ocean
Over the sea
>From out of east of Eden
Pre-B. C.
To Terra Incognito
Anno Domini
Hits the libido
Bal-a-Versailles
People say it's an animal thing
A whisper of alien air
People say you're a fool if you fall in love
I say yeah, yeah, yeah
Dogs are barking,
The caravanserai
Rolls on, through the night
Bal-a-Versailles
People say all the usual things
Talkin' and kissin' the air
People say you're a fool if you fall in love
I say yeah, yeah, yeah
Reason for living
Reason to die
Take it as given
Bal-a-Versailles
Dogs are barking,
The caravanserai
Rolls on, through the night
Bal-a-Versailles
