Song:

As I roved out one fine May morning,
To view the meadows and flowers g**,
Who should I spy, but my own true lover
As she sat by yon willow tree.

I took off my hat and I did salute her,
I did salute her most courageously.
As she turned around, the tears fell from her
Saying, False young man, you've deluded me.
And the diamond ring I behold I gave to you,
A diamond ring to wear on your right hand.
But the vows you made, love, you went and broke them
And you wed the lassie who has the land

If I wed the lassie who has the land, my love,
It's that I'll rue 'till the day I die.
When misfortune falls, sure the man my shun it.
It was my fault, that I'll not deny.

And at night when I go to my bed of slumber
The thoughts of my love are in my mind.
As I turn around to embrace my darling,
Instead of gold, sure 'tis brass I find.

And I wish the queen would bring home her armies
From the West Indies, America and Spain.
And every man to his wedded woman
Oh in hopes that I might be with thee again
