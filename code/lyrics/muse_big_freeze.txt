Song:

Healed, or are you still just reeling?
Are you fine? Have you found a way to escape?
Are you here, just because I need you?
Can we hole up, a big freeze is heading our way.

We are on a hiding to nowhere, 
We still hope, but our dreams are not the same. 
And I, I lost before I started, 
I'm collapsing in stellar clouds of gas.

Hear me. What words just can't convey.
Feel me. Don't let the sun in your heart decay.

Fight, or will you show me mercy?
We've expelled, the goodness from our hearts.
Are you here, just to prove you're winning?
Can we hole up, and ride out this electrical storm?

We destroyed something beautiful.
We have faith, but our truths are not the same.
Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us, 
Stop the loneliest force becoming king of the universe.

Hear me. What words just can't convey.
Feel me. Don't let the sun in your heart decay.

Don't give up, don't let the magic leave us.
We're collapsing in stellar clouds of gas.

Hear me. What words just can't convey.
Feel me. Don't let the sun in your heart decay.
