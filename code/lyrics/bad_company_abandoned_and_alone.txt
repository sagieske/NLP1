Song:

I was left there;
All alone;
No one to care for me;
I have no home.
I got itchy fingers;
Itchy toes;
And a really itchy nose,
And baby, I think you do to!

Abandoned and abandoned,
And alone!
Yeah, all alone.
I said abandoned and alone!

Pull my finger,
Sniff my vapors,
That escape the bowels of
My soul!
Get on your knees and sniff
My farts that escape my
Butt hole!
Yeah!
That's why I'm bad, bad, bad
Bad company and I can't deny!
I mean, no, abandoned.
Yeah abandoned and alone
And stinky.
