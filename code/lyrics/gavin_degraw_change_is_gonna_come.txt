Song:

I was born by the river
In a little tent
O just like the river I've been runnin ever since
Its been a loooong long time comin but I know
Change gonna come
O yes it will
Its been tooooo hard livin but I'm afraid to diiiie
Cuz I don't know whats up there beyond the sky
Its been a long long time comin but I know
Change gonna come wooah yes it will
I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin me don't hang around
Its been a long loooooong time comin but I know
That change gonna come o yes it will
When I go to my brother I say brother help me please
But he winds up not givin me. Back down on my knees beggin pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaase! Yeah! I've been
I couldn't last that long now I think I'm able to carry on.
Its been a long long time long time comin but I know that change gonna come o yes it will.
