Verse 1:
I wish there was a video game
To teach you your ancestors name
I wish there was a phone number

Like 1-800-Save-Your-Brother
I'm thankful for the radio station
Not afraid to put the truth in rotation

There is certain information
That you can only get in conversation with...

Chorus:
Young People, who talk to
Old People, it would make us a
Better People, all around...
(Yes it would)

And if Old People would talk to
Young People, it would make us a
Better People, all around....
(Yes it would)

Verse 2:
We went from radio to TV
Now we're going from LP to CD
Don't be afraid

To try something new
I can help you with the brand new technology
You can help me with the age old philosophy
Together there's so much we can do when...

Chorus:
Young People, who talk to
Old People, it would make us
Better People, all around...

And if Old People would talk to
Young People, it would make us a
Better People, all around....


They say that every
Generation gets worse
THEY CALL IT THE GENERATIONAL CURSE
These problems JUST don't DROP OUT THE SKY (yeah)
Listen to Mahatma Ghandi's words
Be the change you want to see in the world
Start with yourself and healing will multiply
AAAAAAH, that's what happens When..

Chorus:
Young People, who talk to
Old People, it would make us a
Better People, all around...

If Old People would talk to
Young People...
Better People, all around....

If black people
Would talk to white people
It would make us a
Better People
All Around....

If Republican people would (laugh)
Talk to Democratic people (laugh)
It would make us diplomatic people
(laugh) All Around.....
