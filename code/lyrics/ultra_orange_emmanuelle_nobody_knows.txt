Song:

Yuka, don't fall
Don't fall asleep
From the bridge across
The deep and muddy river

No one around
Don't fall down please
You must hold her now
And tell your mum
You won't go

I'll never see her little brown eyes
I'll never have her into my arms

And I know nobody knows
And I know nobody knows

From Ophelia's waters
To the endless sea
It will wash away
Wash away your dreams

White socks
Heart stops
Beating so fast
And your long black hair
Floating round your face

I'll never see her little brown eyes
I'll never have her into my arms

And I know nobody knows
And I swear nobody cares
