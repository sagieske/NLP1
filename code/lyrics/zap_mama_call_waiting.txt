Song:

I just want to tell you
I'm with and behind you
Do what you have to do
I'll still be there

It's like 2 trees
Neighbors for a thousand years
It's like body and soul
You and me
It's ment to be
Can't you see

It's like an island
In the middle of the sea
It's like a soft wind
Caressing my warm skin
You and me mixing together

You and me and me and you
