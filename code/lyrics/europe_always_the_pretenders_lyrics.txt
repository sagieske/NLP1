Song:

Maybe we forced the deal to live in some kind of blow
Maybe we broke the seal,
Cracks begin to show
Maybe we crossed the line, got everything of the ground
Maybe we lit the fuse, a habit hard to lose

All I can remember, all I can recall is you
Telling me there's been an, accident
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do
Every day I miss your, innocence

Maybe we ran the lights, somehow we caused a scene
Maybe we learn to fight, as part of our routine
Maybe we jumped the wall, suddenly tipped the scale
Maybe we tried to hard, so afraid to fail

All I can remember, all I can recall is you
Telling me there's been an, accident
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do
Every day I miss your, innocence

Something's lost and what its worth
You and me this is our church
There is still some love 'round here

All I can remember, all I can recall is you
Telling me there's been an, accident
Always the pretenders, always thought that love would do
Every day I miss your, innocence
