Do you want to touch me tonight
Do you want to get me tonight
Good luck catchin' me tonight
I'm a bad mamma jamma

How hard you're trying to get with me
Won't lead you on no

I'm gonna love your body yeah
Do you feel the heat
Oh I want ya

Oh you my soul brotha

Do you want a sassy li'l thing like me
