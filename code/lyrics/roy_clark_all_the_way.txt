Song:

When somebody loves you it's no good
Unless she loves you all the way
Happy to be near you when you need someone
To cheer you come what may.

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to be
And deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real.

When somebody needs you it's not good
Unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And through all the in between years come what may.

Who knows where the love will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you it's for sure
I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way.
All the way come what may.

Who knows where the love
Will lead us only a fool would say
But if you let me love you it's for sure
I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way...
