Song:

No word comes close enough
To describing what I truly feel
Every time we embrace
All my wonderful dreams become real
You may read all the books
No love story was ever like this
I could die for just one tender kiss
From my only love

You may gather the stars
Choose the brightest throughout all the skies
None of them can compare
To the glow that I see in his eyes
For the brightness of day
I can bet isn't caused by the sun
Where is daylight when love light is gone
With my only love

I could roam the earth
'Till eternity's tired of me
No one else will I see
Who's as gentle and tender as he
For all that is worth, I will love him with all honesty
I'll be faithful like no one can be
He loves no one but me

**For I'm his other half
Him and I, we are meant to be one
We will share everything
Be it sorrow or heartbreak or fun
And i'll live just for him
He for me and you never can doubt
Life will simply mean nothing without
My only love

~Woo~hoo~hoo~hoo~Wooohoohoohoo~~~

(For all that is worth, I will love him with all honesty)
I will love him with all honesty
(I'll be faithful like no one can be)
I'll be faithful 'cause
He loves no one but me

**Repeat

And my life will be simply about
My only love
