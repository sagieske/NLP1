Cause I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
Hands in the sky like

I'm A-W-E, some call me awesome
Some call me Vizzy, honeys call me often
Gator on my shirt, what did it Lacoste him?
Jesus Christ I'm good, please don't cross him
How rude, Stephanie Tanner
You don't gotta watch me but please watch your manners
And I be getting green so mean, Bruce Banner
Gift of flow and presence, man, I'm the new santa
And, uh, I'm saying, Kansas where I'm staying with
It's be bang banging likes Pops on the Wayan's
And even through the hating and wars, they thought I stay in
Who you playing, I done went Super Saiyan
This that, off the glass, off the floor, off the wall jam
We in the building, you wishing you had the floor plans
You just a doorman, doorman
I wish I had more hands

Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes?
Two thumbs up, you goin' point 'em at this guy
Al Edison couldn't be this fly, so ask how I feel and you know I reply like

I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
Hands in the sky like

Ay, I'm awesome, every time I lay it down
I think that I kill 'em, play possum
Death proof, ride with Rosario Dawson
Tell 'em open wide when they see how I'm flossing, ching! 
Cooler than a peppermint, Wayne's World excellent
Party on Garth, shwing!, work ethic harder than a Mexican
That's why I can walk up into any restaurant and close the whole thing
See, even G couldn't F with it
Semi colon dash parenthesis, text messaging
That's a side smiley face 'cause I'mma make the best of it
I assume you should make room for the elephant
Boom, where I come from is irrelevant
'Cause my glory is all that I revel in
And my story begins where most others end
So all I really got to tell 'em is

Now tell me what got two thumbs and knows how to spit rhymes?
Two thumbs up, you goin' point 'em at this guy
Al Edison couldn't be this fly, so ask how I feel and you know I reply like

I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
Hands in the sky like

I feel so, awesome
How you feel, awesome
I guess that's, awesome
Shorty you fine and ya body is, awesome
Wanna roll? Awesome
Well let's go. Awesome
