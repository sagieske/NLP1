Song:

My morning starts to shine
With teardrops in my eyes
And here I am alone
Starting to realize

That my days would be brighter
If I could learn to hide
When feelings that I hide from you
Keep hurting me inside

Then my day begins
With simple thoughts of you
Hoping that tomorrow
Will be me and you

Sharing dreams with each other
And making them come true
Holding one another
Saying all I need is you

Chorus
(And/But) will you say that you love me
And show me that you care
Say when I need you
You will always be there
But if you go and leave me
This I swear is true
My love will always be with you

Now my nights would end
With just one wish that's you
To hold in me in the darkness
And help me make it through

Cause the pain that's inside me
Would simply melt away
If I have you here with me
And promise me you'd stay

Chorus
