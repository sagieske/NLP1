Song:

You said you'd be there for me
In times of trouble when I need you and I'm down
And like why do you need friendship
It's from my side pure love but I see lately things have been changing
You have goals to achieve
But the road you take abroad and heartless that wants you make another way
You throw stones
Can't you see that I am human I am breathing
But you don't give a damn

Chorus
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood... Keeps rushing

And now the world is asleep
How will you ever wake her up when she gets deep in the dreams, wishing
And yet so many die
And still we think that it is all about us
It's all about you
You sold your soul to the evil and the lust
And the passion and the money and you
And the same ones die, and people hunger for talking,
Suffer under civilized damn robbers but they stabled us

Chorus
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing

Blood blood blood... Keeps rushing

Invaded, eliminated, erased, interrogated
Our tradition, our love for our fellow countrymen,
Our property, our ancestors - have died

Can you feel, can you feel my heart beating?

Chorus
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing
Can't you feel my heart is beating
Can't you see the pain you're causing
