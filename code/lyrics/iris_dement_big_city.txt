Song:

I'm tired of this dirty old city
Entirely too much work and never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks
I think I'll walk off my steady job today

Chorus:
So turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
Gimme all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your, so called, social security
Big City turn me loose and set me free

I've been working every day since I was twenty
I ain't got a thing to show for anything I've done
Some folks never work and they've got plenty
I think it's time girls like me had some fun

(chorus)

Big City turn me loose and set me free
