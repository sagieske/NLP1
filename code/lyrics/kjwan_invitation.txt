Song:

Hello
I bet you didn't think you'd find me here alone
The special voice that calls to you from your phone
You're out of reach but now I'm inside your home
You'll never be alone again

Don't run
If you do you'll only elevate the fun
It's funny how you head into the sun
I watch you burn your skin and scream out my name
You'll never be alone again
No

Mirrors on your walls have cracked
I can see you now
Images reflecting shards
I can make you out
Shadow rises on a star
I can make you shine
When I start to close my eyes
You never felt the same

Are you scared?
I'm wishing that you weren't 'cause I won't dare
Rip and desecrate all that I hold dear
A secret fallen angel that I revere
You'll never be alone again

So inviting
So inviting

Mirrors on your walls have cracked
I can see you now
Images reflecting shards
I can make you out
Shadow rises on a star
I can make you shine
When I start to close my eyes
You never felt the same

So inviting
