Song:

I was naive not to let you go
When the time was right
I was a fool living in a dream
That I thought could last

But I know that you
Will try to prove me wrong
But it's what I've got to do

I think you're mistaken
I'm sorry to say
I'm really just a loser
Who's getting in your way
I think you've forgotten
All of your plans
See you never meant to be here
And I think you should know
You're better off alone

And it's clear to me
That everything has changed
Cuz nothing that we do feels
The same any more
And I'll admit
I'll take the blame
Maybe we just moved too fast
And how could we expect
Something like this to last

And I know that you will try
And prove me wrong
But it's what I gotta do

I think you're mistaken
I'm sorry to say
I'm really just a loser
Who's getting in your way
I think you've forgotten
All of your plans
See you never meant to be here
And I think you should know
You're better off alone

You and I, we were standing
Watching us fall apart
So let me go and move along

I think you're mistaken
I'm sorry to say
I'm really just a loser
Who's getting in your way
I think you've forgotten
All of your plans
See I never meant to be here
And I think you should know
You're better off alone

Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
Oh, you're better off alone

I think you're mistaken
I'm sorry to say
I'm really just a loser
You're better off alone

Better off alone
