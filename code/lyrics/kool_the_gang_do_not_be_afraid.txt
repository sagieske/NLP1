Song:

How fast did you fly, oh Gabriel
Winging your way to a worn out world
What was it like as an angel
Sharing the plan with one shaken girl
What did you say?

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
You will get through
All that’s asked of you
Heaven’s child is here
There’s no need to fear
God is bending near and He will stay
Do not be afraid

How bright did you shine in that moment
Breaking the news that could finally be told
How did you reach someone dreaming
Speaking to Joseph’s agonized soul
Only one thing to say

How bright did you shine in that moment
Breaking the news that could finally be told
How did you reach someone dreaming
Speaking to Joseph’s agonized soul
Only one thing to say

And on that midnight
How loud did you sing
Filling up the air with a thundering choir
How did you settle the shepherds
Replacing fear with a burning desire (you said)

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
You will get through
All that’s asked of you
Heaven’s child is here
There’s no room for fear
Peace and goodwill have won the day
Perfect love will drive your fear away
Do not be afraid
