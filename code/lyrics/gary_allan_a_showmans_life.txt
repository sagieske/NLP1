Song:

A showman's life,
Is a smokey bar,
And the fevered chase,
Of a tiny star,
It's a hotel room,
And a lonely wife,
From what I've seen,
Of a showman's life

Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There's no mention of,
All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker's heart,
Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part

A boy will dream,
As children do,
Of a great white way,
Until the dream comes true,
And a phony smile,
In a colored light,
Is all there is,
To a showman's life,
Nobody told me about this part

Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There's no mention of,
All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker's heart,
Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part

But nobody told me about this part

Nobody told me about this part,
They told me all about the pretty girls,
And the wine,
And the money,
And the good times,
There's no mention of,
All the wear and tear,
On an old honky tonker's heart,
Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part

Well I might of known it,
But nobody told me about this part
