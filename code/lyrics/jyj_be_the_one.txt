Song:

I feel the temperature rise girl, when I see you movin,
It's hot, you got me burnin' up, so baby let's go!
After all that's said and done, baby, you're my only one

My only fantasy, just can't keep my hands down
You gotta let me know, girl if you want it tonight
(Your body's so tight, I can make you feel right)
You got me in the zone, girl let's go on a ride
(Girl tonight, won't stop, till you say, yeah)

Be the one (Be the one),
Be the one (be the one)- Do you right -
Baby come over tonight
Be the one (Be the one)
Be the one (be the one)- Do you right -
Show you the time of your life

I can see it in your eyes, girl I know what you're thinkin'
You wanna be my number one, so whatcha waitin' for?
After all that's said and done, baby, you're my only one

My only fantasy, just can't keep my hands down
You gotta let me know, girl if you want it tonight (your body's so tight,
I can make you feel right)
You got me in the zone, girl let's go on a ride
(Girl tonight, won't stop, till you say yeah)

Be the one (Be the one)
Be the one (be the one)- Do you right -
Baby come over tonight
Be the one (Be the one)
Be the one (be the one)- Do you right -
Show you the time of your life

Baby let your mind go, I'll take it real slow
Just get inside, make you feel alright
I know you want more, wanna lose control
Let your inhibitions go...

Be the one (Be the one)
Be the one (be the one)- Do you right-
Baby come over tonight
Be the one (Be the one)
Be the one (be the one)-Do you right-
Show you the time of your life
