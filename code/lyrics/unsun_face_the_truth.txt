Song:

I'm weakening
Something's wrong with me
I thought that I was to come first
I don't know what is true
I'm living with fear
From morning to night
I'm losing my passion for life,
Hoping that the end of my worries is near

I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same
I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same

I thought that I was right
But I've made a big mistake
I am changing myself for good
Because I have understood
I feel like a grain of sand
On the empty desert
Every man is special, every man
I feel like a grain

I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same
I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same

I'm weakening
Something's wrong with me
I thought that I was to come first
I don't know what's true
I'm living with fear
From morning to night
I'm losing my passion for life,
Hoping that the end of my worries is near

I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same
I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same

Everything I've known about... About the world,
Was just a fraction of truth... Truth about him
I feel like a grain of sand on the empty desert
I feel like a grain of sand, I feel like a grain

I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same
I have changed myself,
Growing up every day
Face the truth about yourself
You and I, we're all the same
