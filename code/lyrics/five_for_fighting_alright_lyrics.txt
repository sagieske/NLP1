Song:

I took her leaving like I did before
I turned around and I asked for more
And she didn't even mean a thing to me

I left my spirit at the chapel door
I sailed around til I lost the war
And you didn't even think to send a thing

But I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more

I hit my head upon the chamber door
And all the marbles rolled on the floor
And all the psychos in the ward start screamingЎ­

I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more

My baby

I'm alright, alright, I feel alright
I never been better in my life
You know the score

I'm just fine, I'm fine, feeling fine
A regular sawed off valentine
That nothing more
