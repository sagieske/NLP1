Schreib"are Sam Cooke

Don't know much about history,
Don't know much biology.
Don't know much about a science book,
Don't know much about the french I took.
But I do know that I love you,
And I know that if you love me, too,
What a wonderful world this would be.

Don't know much about geography,
Don't know much trigonometry.
Don't know much about algebra,
Don't know what s slide rule is for.
But I know that one and one is two,
And if this one could be with you,
What a wonderful world this would be.

I don't claim to be an 'a' student,
But I'm tryin' to be.
For maybe by being an 'a'-student, baby,
I can win your love for me.

Don't know much about history,
Don't know much biology.
Don't know much about a science book,
Don't know much about the french I took.
But I do know that I love you,
And I know that if you love me, too,
What a wonderful world this would be.

History
Biology
Science book
French I took.
But I do know that I love you,
And I know that if you love me, too,
What a wonderful world this would be.
