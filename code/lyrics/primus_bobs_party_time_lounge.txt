Song:

Glad you came, glad you're here
Have some champagne, imported beer

Dig down in your dirt bag and roll us out a spleef
Been erect here now for thirteen days and I came to get relief, relief

Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time

Peck my nose with cocaine to feed my filthy hole
Bust out the dancin' women, I'm prone to lose control
And if by chance I fall down and bust my head on the floor
Just wrap my wound in a porterhouse steak and point me towards the shore, the shore

Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time,
At Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time, Bob's Party Time

Glad you came, glad you were here
We drank champagne, imported beer
At Bob's Party Time no glass goes dry
