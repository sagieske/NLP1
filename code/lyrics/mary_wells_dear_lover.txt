Song:

Dear lover
It's been a long long time

So I'm writing this letter to find out if your still mine

Oh I miss you so much

And I wish I can see you some how

Let no others take your heart while your apart from me

Please be faithfull please be true

I'll never stop loving you

Dear lover
I wonder do you fell the same way too

Does this felling in your heart as strong
As the love I have for you

Ohh you must belive me when I say
I never love this way

Ohh I'll be yours till the end of time
If there forever and A day
If thrers forever and A day

Ohh dear lover
If you would just answer my letter

A few words from you
Could make me feel so much better

Yeahhh

(Dear lover)ooh I need ya
(Dear lover) aim to please ya
(Dear lover)if you would just answer my letter
(Dear lover)it would make me fell so much better
(Dear lover) ooooh I love ya
(Dear lover)
