Song:

I got money,
Everything that I ever wanted,
Never thought of what I might need,
Need, need
Aint it funny,
How I spend my whole life running,
Reaching for the sky,
I aint coming down,
With nothing,

Feels like I'm 4 years old,
All over again,
Cause I'm just running fast,
And should be walking,
Saying when I grow up,
You gun see,
I'm gun be comfortable,
And happy,

I guess I was thinking,
Cause look at all the money I'm making,
Still nothing can compare to the thought,
Of... Love,
But it's taking,
Too much time to see that I'm wasting,
Reaching for the sky,
I aint coming down with nothing,

It Feels like I'm 4 years old,
All over again,
Cause I'm just running fast,
And should be walking,
Saying when I grow up,
You gun see,
I'm gun be comfortable,
And happy,

I'm so alone,
I feel so alone,
So alone in this world,
Got everything I want,

It Feels like I'm 4 years old,
All over again,
Cause I'm just running fast,
And should be walking,
Saying when I grow up,
You gun see,
I'm gun be comfortable,
And happy,

Woaah oh oh oh oh.
