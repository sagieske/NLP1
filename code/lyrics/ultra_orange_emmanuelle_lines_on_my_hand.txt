Song:

Is it written with your blood
Or is it just a lipstick note
One morning when I woke-up
Painted on the bathroom door
The lines of my hand
You just read me like a book
The lines of my hand
There was a strange look into your eyes
Using make-up
For your break-up
The traces of the kiss goodbye
Making love on the rock
Wake-up the puff and nothing
The lines of my hand
You just read me like a book
The lines of my hand
There was a strange look into your eyes
Thanx for the ride
I'm on my way
And don't be so sad
Is it written with your blood
Or is it just a lipstick note
One morning when I woke-up
Painted on the bathroom door
The lines of my hand
You just read me like a book
The lines of my hand
There was a strange look into your eyes
Using make-up
For your breake-up
The traces of the kiss goodbye
