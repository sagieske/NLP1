Song:

Slowly stars go out each night
Dark meets light, kiss the sun goodnight
New day comes as our life's just begun
You're now mine

And every time you hold my hand
There's an understanding of who I am
New life is born unlike before
I'm now yours

You can feel it in the summer breeze
Tonight the world's at ease
You are the one for me
After all the waiting I can finally breathe
Earth and skies say what they may
I will love you all throughout my days
Happiness, happens when our hearts combine
When it's you I'm with I come alive
It's just so clear to see
Darling we are meant to be

Your love is like amazing grace
Sounds so sweet I can almost taste
I've been given more what I could ever asked for
I am yours

I can feel it in the summer breeze
Tonight the world's at ease
You are the one for me
After all the waiting I can finally breathe
Earth and skies say what they may
I will love you all throughout my days
Happiness happens when our hearts combine
When it's you I'm with I come alive
It's just so clear to see
Darling we are meant

I feel at home whenever your around
I feel so secure, so safe and sound
What else can I say
What else can I say

You are the one for me
After all the waiting I can finally breathe
Earth and skies say what they may
I will love you all throughout my days
Happiness happens when our hearts combine
When it's you I'm with I come alive
It's just so clear to see
Darling we are meant
Darling we are meant to be
