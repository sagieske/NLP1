Song:

When I look at you
I see something so beautiful
When I see you
You shine the truth

When I look I see
All you shine and all your beauty
If you only knew what I know

And if you only knew what I know
If you'd only seen what I've seen
If you understood what I now understand

Then you would surely see
And you would listen just to me

For you are beautiful
You are beautiful
Beautiful to me

If you could shut the eary darkness
And if you could focus on the light
If you could hear the song
That's sung over you

So don't give them the power
To tell them who you are
For you were born to shine
Like the star that you are
