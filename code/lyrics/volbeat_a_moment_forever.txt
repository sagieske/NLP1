Song:

Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top
Keep it up my baby don't go don't do it on top
Keep it on my baby ***** pop
Keep it up my baby don't go don't leave it on top

See all the lovers walk hand in hand in the park
And hide all the action
Once couple are frozen and bondage forever more
With chains around the ankles
Standing like statues, so lucky to see them here
And feeling their presence
Their love for each other was taking away by force
For ages and ages

Be silent where ever they go
Cos their moment is forever
Be silent whenever they dance

Their story goes on that they're moving away by thoughts
From city to city
Showing that love can't be killed even after dark, and even after their death
Dancing with shadows so lucky to see them here
And feeling their presence
The chain around ankles rattling their melo song forever and ever

Be silent where ever they go
Cos their moment is forever
Be silent whenever they dance oh!
A bow for the couple that shows that their moment is forever
Be silent whenever the dance
