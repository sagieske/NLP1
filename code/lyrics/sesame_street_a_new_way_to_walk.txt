Song:

I was feeling low, I was kinda blue
But that's all gone since I got something new

I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
And my new walk suits me fine

I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
And it makes my spirit shine

It's a little bit of strut and a lot of smooth
And a little bit of bouncing fine
My chin is up, my feet don't stall
When I walk my walk, I walk real tall

I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
And it shows how good I feel

This little piggy went to the market
This little piggy stayed home
This little piggy got a whole new walk
And look at these pig feet take me home

I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
And it shows I've got some sense

I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
And I walk with confidence

I got a new way, way to walk
(Walk, walk)
I got a new way to walk
(Walk, walk)

(repeat and fade)
