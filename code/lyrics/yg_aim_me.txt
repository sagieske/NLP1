[Verse:]
Aint s**t changed, I be on the sidekick everyday
What's ya number naah what's yaa aim,
You cute girl what you expect for me to say,
I hit her up like what you doing today,
She didn't hit me back, she put her away in my face
Thass mean you rude. That'ss why you still got a sidekick2,
Now I'm on to the next chick, " chupa mi pito " my aims famous
My sidekick prepaid just aim it.
Talking to girls that don't speak my language, out of all her icons. Mines her favorite
& she would never ignore me,
If I aimed ya girlfriend I bet she store me!

[Chorus:]
You trynna kick it (maybe)
Where ya man (he Gone)
Aim me!
Wait how you getting home, aim me
I don't talk on the phone jus aim me.
Aim Me x6
I don't talk on the phone just aim me

[Verse 2:]
