Put me on the stand
And I'll turn into a liaaaar

Redone
Shayne ward

From the moment that we hit it off (Hey)
I've been chillin with you non-stop (Hey)
Try to play it cool
But I lost (Hey)
Got me acting like you're my boss

The body on you got me drunk from no drink
Baby I am starting to think

[Chorus:]
You got me brainwashed
Just say the word and I am set this place on fire
You got me brainwashed
From 9 to 5 I am gonna work to take you higher
You got me brainwashed
Put me on the stand and I am ll turn into a liar
You got me brainwashed
Brainwashed, brainwashed

Brainwashed, brainwashed, brainwashed
Brainwashed, brainwashed, brainwashed

So I let your friends be my friends (Hey)
Cause you said that we should be friends (Hey)
And I ain't calling them chicks back (Hey)
Cause I know you wouldn't like that

The way that you sway got me drunk from no drink
Baby I'm starting to think

[Chorus:]
You got me brainwashed
Just say the word and I am set this place on fire
You got me brainwashed
From 9 to 5 I am gonna work to take you higher
You got me brainwashed
Put me on the stand and I am turn into a liar
You got me brainwashed
Brainwashed, brainwashed

Brainwashed, brainwashed, brainwashed
Brainwashed, brainwashed, brainwashed

I don't know what you doing to my head
I keep doing everything you said
You say jump and I am jumping off the edge
You got me brainwashed
I don't know what you doing to my head
I keep doing everything you said
You say jump and I am jumping off the edge
You got me brainwashed
Ooooomg... Ohhhhhh. You got me brainwashed

[Chorus: x2]
You got me brainwashed
Just say the word and I am set this place on fire
You got me brainwashed
From 9 to 5 I am gonna work to take you higher
You got me brainwashed
Put me on the stand and I am turn into a liar
You got me brainwashed
Brainwashed, brainwashed
