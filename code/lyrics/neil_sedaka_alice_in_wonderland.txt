Song:

Alice, pretty little Alice
Pretty little Alice in Wonderland

Alice in wonderland
Won't you take me by the hand
And lead me to your wonderland of love

I took one look at you
And that was all I had to do
Alice, you're the girl I'm dreamin of

Tweedle dum, tweedle dee
You have made my life a fantasy
You don't know what you're doin to me
My heart goes pitter patter cause I'm mad as a hatter for

Alice my little girl
There is no other in this whole wide world
Take me by the hand, tell me you understand
Alice, Alice in wonderland

Repeat last two verses

Oh Alice, pretty little Alice
Pretty little Alice in wonderland
