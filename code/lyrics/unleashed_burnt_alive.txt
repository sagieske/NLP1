Song:

Burnt Alive
She was burnt Alive

Before the holy cross
The priest of christ he knelt
Oh help me mighty god
And save me from this hell
She still rejecting me
Oh god why can't she see
Tell me it's your will
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive

Before the holy cross
Again he knelt and grinned
Oh help her mighty god
And save her from this sin
She cares not for my right
To take her when I please
It is the will of god
To set my seed free

And god said:
In fire... you tie her...
To the stake... you witch
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
She was burnt alive
...burnt alive
