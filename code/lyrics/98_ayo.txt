Song:

(Verse)
I came here on the mission,
And I ain’t leaving here alone
So baby, tell me where to go
Can’t make my exit without you.

Your friends don’t even know you’re gone
You got a man, who needs ‘em now?
Right now it’s me and you, come on,
Forget these people around you.

(Pre-Chorus)
We’re gonna make this all night
Let’s keep it going till sunlight.
They try and stop us, we gonna fight
Let’s do it all the way wrong till it’s all the way right.

(Chorus)
So lose yourself in it and say ayo
If you’re down with it say ayo
DJ keep spinning like ayo
Cause we ain’t finished, ayo.

(Verse)
Know you don’t wanna miss this, right
I see the burning in your eyes.
Your body’s giving me the signs
No use in you trying to fight it.

(Pre-Chorus)
We’re gonna make this all night
Let’s keep it going till sunlight.
They try and stop us, we gonna fight
Let’s do it all the way wrong till it’s all the way right.

(Chorus)
So lose yourself in it and say ayo
If you’re down with it say ayo
DJ keep spinning like ayo
Cause we ain’t finished, ayo.

(Bridge)
Now I hope you ain’t tired,
Cause this fire’s taking over the floor.
So throw your hands in the air,
Let me hear you say ayo.

(Pre-Chorus)
We’re gonna make this all night
Let’s keep it going till sunlight.
They try and stop us, we gonna fight
Let’s do it all the way wrong till it’s all the way right.

(Chorus)
So lose yourself in it and say ayo
If you’re down with it say ayo
DJ keep spinning like ayo
Cause we ain’t finished, ayo.
