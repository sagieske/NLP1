All flowers:
Little bread-and-butterflies kiss
The tulips, and the sun is like a
Toy balloon. There are get up in
The morning glories, in the golden
Afternoon. There are dizzy daffodils
On the hillside, strings of violets
Are all in tune, Tiger lilies love
The dandy lions, in the golden
Afternoon, the golden afternoon.
There are dog and caterpillars and a
Copper centipede, where the lazy
Daisies love the very peaceful life
They lead... You can learn a lot of
Things from the flowers, for especially
In the month of June. There's a wealth
Of happiness and romance, all in the
Golden afternoon. ... All in the golden
Afternoon, the golden afternoon...
Alice:
You can learn a lot of things from the
Flowers, for especially in the month of
June. There's a wealth of happiness and
Romance, oh...
Flowers:... The golden afternoon!
