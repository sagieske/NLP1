Song:

All over the world, people must meet and part
There's someone like me feeling a pain in their heart

Some may meet again under that same bright star
If maybe some night, you come back from afar
Who cares if tonight, I don't know where you are

Are you thinking of me now, missing having me around
If you have forgotten me, my world will come tumbling down

All over the world, others are sad tonight
There's someone like me, atching the sun's fading light

All over the sky, there is the same warm glow
Here under that star, I'm wanting you to know
Wherever you are, that I still love you so.
