Song:

Here is my heart, I give it Lord to You
Here is my life, I lay it before You
Where else would I go?
What else would I do?
If I did not know You?
How deeply I need You

How deeply I need You, my Lord
How deeply I need You, my Lord
Like the desert needs the rain, I need You
Like the ocean needs the streams, I need You
Like the morning needs the sun, I need You
Lord You are my only one

(repeat all)

In every way, and every day
I need You
