Verse:
I always wonder where you are
I'm right beside you, you're so far away
Moments your not facing me
Moments your not chasing me
I don't believe in good goodbyes
Cause even when the roses die
There's still some thorns left in your side
It's like a funeral for the bride
And I know candy girls yeah, they just rot you're teeth
But I've always been such a sucker for sweets

Chorus:
I need affection,
All I want right now is Affection
I don't mean to point your direction
Girl it's not what you do, it's what you don't do makes me I have to talk to
You
About affection, I need affection

Verse:
Somewhere alone, is when I die
On the banks of some canal yeah the river bitter tears I try to hide
And even fools will believe in lies
And if every word you ever said where true
You be my guide and I just pray to you,

Chorus:
For Affection
All I want right now is affection
I don't mean to make a confesion
Girl it's not what you do, it's what you don't do makes a man come on you
You know affection, I need affection.

Bridge:
Why wont you dance with me?
There's no more romance with me.
You don't think I see you, but I see right through you baby

Chorus:
Woah Affection
All I want is some afftection
All I need is some affection
Affection
Yeah yeah yeah.

You don't think I see you, I see right through you
You don't think I see you, But I do.
