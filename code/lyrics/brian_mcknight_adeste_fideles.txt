Song:

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing, in exhaltation
O sing, all ye citizens
Of heav'n above

Glory to God
Glory in the Highest

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Oh Jesus, to Thee
Be the glory giv'n
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
