Andycat]Do you know what I'm sayin?
[Dizzy Dustin]I know what you're sayin.
[3x]
[Andycat]Do you know what I'm sayin?
[Dizzy Dustin]Man, I know what you're sayin'

Verse One: Andy C

You see I'm programmed to slam in the summer spring or fall
Pushin' up spit ball through plastic straws
And this may sound disgusting and like very gross
When I get my fill I chili most
MC's out there ya better stand clear
I have no time for conversation my dear
From kings come queens and from Queens come kings
BUt the cookie, Cookie crack took all those things
You're like a daytime talk show, and that low
Knockin on my door sayin eh, yo, yo
I go on and on like popcorn
Hook a beat up and convert into Hip-hop form
I'm so and so I this I that
When the crowds like this I'm ready to rap
So microphone checka 1,2 what is this?
Your moms in my business, she's in my business

Young Einstein[Scratch]go off, go off
Andy Cooper(What?)go off, go off[Scratch: You know what I'm sayin?]
[Both]You know what I'm sayin
[4x]
Einstein, he knows what I'm sayin
[Scratch: You know what I'm sayin]

Dizzy Dustin(huh?)go off, go off
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

Verse Two: Andy C

When I was 5 years old I realized there was a road
Too hot to handle and too cold to hold
This is the music of a hip-hop band
And no rapper can rap quite like I can
And, what have you let me, yo what have I got
12 woofers in the trunk beatin' down the block
I make a right at the laundry, you see my name on the wall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Girl what do you think this is presidents day?
It's not the strategy, it's not the game I play
She said Choiyoiyoiyoiyoiyoiyoi
I break an Mc like a Tonka toy
I make it sound and later make a dub
The answer is "D" , all of the above
Elvis was a hero to most
I'm not from France, but I eat French toast

[Scratch: You know what I'm sayin?]
[Both]You know what I'm sayin
[4x]
Einstein, he knows what I'm sayin
[Scratch: You know what I'm sayin
