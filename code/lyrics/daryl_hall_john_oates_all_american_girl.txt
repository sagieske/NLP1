Song:

Skin tight soul delight
Changing her life for another
She dreams magazines
Sees herself on the cover
Anything anytime anywhere
Its fitting in that matters
Faithfully she believes in the look he wants to know better

She knows what she wants
Shes an all american girl
She knows what she needs
Shes a sold american girl
She knows what she knows
Shes an all american girl
She does what she does
Shes an all american girl
Sold american

Shes got a double bubble with a bossanova back
Shes a real hot pepper and I like it like that
Its all right you dont have to change your way
Youre all right Im hoping the best part stays

She knows what she wants
Shes an all american girl
She knows what she needs
Shes a sold american girl
She knows what she knows
Shes an all american girl
She does what she does
Shes an all american girl
Sold american

Street smart close to the heart gotta be real
More than the clothes you wear
You know what youve got look to your heart
You carry your history there
