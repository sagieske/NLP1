Song:

All of my life
Needed a reason
To find out who I am


I've had my share
Acts of treason
Slipping right through my hands
What am I waiting for...


Sometimes I feel
Like I live in a dream
Alone in my Paradise Lost

Can it be real?
Tell me what does it mean
Alone in my Paradise Lost


So many years
Is there an answer?
In this castle made of sand


As time passes by
I'm running out of chances
Who will understand
What I am waiting for..
