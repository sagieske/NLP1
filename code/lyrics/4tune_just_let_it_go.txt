Song:

never could imagine life without
from the moment you walked into my world
never knew how long a loving flame would burn
but losing you has forced me to learn
that we cant change the way we feel inside
and every try at love never turns out right
we both know its better if we just let it go

so lets have
one last kiss
one last touch
one last tender moment between us
one last dance
to our first song
while pretending theres nothin wrong
lets lay here for a while and cherish every moment we're in denial
we both know its better if we just let it go

everytime i try to make a stand at all
i see your face again and i fall
in the middle of the night theres a scent of a rose
the smell of your perfume i suppose
but we cant change the way we feel inside
and every try at love never turns out right
we both know its better if we just let it go

so lets have
one last kiss
one last touch
one last tender moment between us
one last dance
to our first song
while pretending theres nothin wrong
lets lay here for a while and cherish every moment we're in denial
we both know its better if we just let it go

maybe if we met each other under a different sky
maybe then things would be much better between you and i
(we could hold)
we can always hold on to this one special thing we share
but it would be to much for us to bare

so lets have
one last kiss
one last touch
one last tender moment between us
one last dance
to our first song
while pretending theres nothin wrong
lets lay here for a while and cherish every moment we're in denial
we both know its better if we just let it go
let it go let it go
