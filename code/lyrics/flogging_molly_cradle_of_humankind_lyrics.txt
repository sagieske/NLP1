Song:

The sum of all my fears like dread are from demons yet to come
All the things I should've mentioned wave goodbye and "we'll see you soon"
It's the words I've never written that say more about myself
Where empty is the promise lies a pocket full of doubt

So may the road I've yet to take
Leave a smile across my face
Till the laughter sheds the darkness far behind
For I still belong in the cradle of humankind

Though my time may be less traveled than those that come before
We're all exiles here in madness kicking down each other's door
Unforgiven is the lesson we pour upon ourselves
When a helping hand's is needed, a slap in the face is what we get

But I will fight for this right and each moment of it's life
Till I witness all the differences yet to heal

So may the road I've yet to take
Leave a smile across my face
Till the laughter sheds the darkness far behind
For I still belong in the cradle of humankind

Sometimes drink till I am empty, grab another from the shelf
Though I'm stuck in conversation, it's with myself and no one else
Never listen to much reason till I hear it's last call
When I notice that ghost is still dancing on his own

So may the road I've yet to take
Leave a smile across my face
Till the laughter sheds the darkness far behind
For I still belong in the cradle of humankind

Wherever you go ([something about the sun])
Wherever you go
Wherever you go ([something about passion])
Oh, wherever you go

There will always be a roof and a dream above our heads
As long as I'm breathing, then forever I'll be

Ah, I will fight for this right and each moment of it's life
Till I witness all the differences yet to heal

So may the road I've yet to take
Leave a smile across my face
Till the laughter sheds the darkness far behind
For I still belong in the cradle of humankind
