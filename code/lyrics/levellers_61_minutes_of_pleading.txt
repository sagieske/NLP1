Song:

As the blood flowed
Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming
Nobody's coming
As the blood flowed
Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming

The call came in
Lorraine shot down
Her husband pulled the trigger
And then he blew his brains out
At the other end
The police took a call
They didn't believe
That he was dead at all
So they wouldn't help her
And she knew

It had been 20 years
Since they fell in love
He's brought a lot of pain
But now he's brought a lot of blood
And he's taken more
Than his share

We can't lose a life
The police chief said
There's an armed man in there
Who'd be better off dead
As Lorraine bled from the legs

And as the blood flowed
Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming
Nobody's coming
As the blood flowed Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming

Speak to me now
But all she could say
Was, I don't want to die like this
So they said they're on their way
But they never heard
That she was Lorraine
So they didn't let her die
With even her name
As she left us all in pain

And as the blood flowed
Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming
Nobody's coming
As the blood flowed
Lorraine knew
That there'd be nobody coming
