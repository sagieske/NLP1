Song:

(feat. Michelle Shellers)

Down in the depths of my soul
Feeling the lost of control
In its spirit
So colourful
If you feel it then let's go
To a place where you belong
Give it strength to carry on
Open your heart
Set your mind at ease
Live your life
And you'll be free

We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Uhmmmm uhhm

Rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Yeah Hey yeah Uhmm

Sometimes you feel like
You're down and out
Feeling the pressure
And you're in doubt
And your feeling low
Nowhere to go
Don't you worry
I know you're gonna

Rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Yeah Hey yeah Uhmm

We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising

We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise

Keep on rising, rising, rising
Rising, rising, rising, rise ohh ohh yea
