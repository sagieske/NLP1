Song:

I got my top down
And I'm ready to roll
Watch me go now
I'm leaving this town
To the Costa del Sol
Come on let's go now

The stars are out tonight
The moon is shining down on me
With rays of pure delight
And I'll be spendin'

24/7 in my 911
And I ain't gonna work
A 9-2-5
24/7 in my 911
On a highway to heaven
It's the time of my life

Cruisin'
Cruisin' down the street
Cruisin'
Cruisin' down the street
Up and down the street

You're my lover
You're my Romeo
Watch me glow now
Rockin' to the Rhythm
On Venga Radio
Don't let go now

Bridge

24/7 in my 911
And I ain't gonna work
A 9-2-5
24/7 in my 911
On a highway to heaven
It's the time of my life
