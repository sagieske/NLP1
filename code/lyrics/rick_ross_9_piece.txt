[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Suave house, stil lindependant
Distribution mexican
He still sending
No contract, take my word
Send a hundred packs b***h
Them my birds
Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
In the two seater, me and two women
No Def Jam, went solo
Took the custy's prices solo

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls

[T. I. - Verse 2]
It's the king young gunna
Hotter thana suana in the summer
N***a think I'm playing round if you wanna
Bring the thunder and the lightening
Like a sighting if you try me
On that Wrren Buffet s**t
That monkey s**t behind me
You want me square n***a you know where to find me
Don't call me on my cell
Yopu tryna send a pimp to jail
If you buying 25 you can get it for the twelve

Uncut, rocked up, got hand and pale yeah
Hey let me send a little message to my enemies
You n***a get to telling have 'em buried 'fore they sentence me
Come to atl, hit any trap they remember me
Billionaire swag witha dope boys energy

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls

[Rick Ross - Verse 3]
Soft white, I got that G-mix
I'm going Gold, crumbs to the bricks
I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips
Trick a hundred hoes
Spend a few chips
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Got your bottom b***h going awol
Nigga's looking at ya like you fell off
No sir, not me
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof, n***a teflon
Why you snorting that
That s**t stepped on

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones
He bought four, I front him 5 more

9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls
9 piece, straight 8 balls
Mjg b***h I got 8 balls
