Song:

Wtf did I do to her?
Nothing n***a
Why she wanna play with me?
My feelings got nothing
But you can't stay with me
Sorry girl, I'm griming
Rest in peace
Now we got 2 daddies

This is a reunion in family
I wanna f**k you girl
Put it on
Baby girl I can get it on
You're the picture
I'mma put you on a wall

Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it

No party, I'm sorry
Ridin' around in a motorcycle
It's not a Harley
Better look like a retarded
Had a n***a look b***h
Try this

I can walk around with that 40
Ni***z had beef
Eat it up cause I'm hungry
F**k with me every time
I was in L. A chillin'
A deal I ain't never signed

Sue a n***a and no talking
Shht to my talkin'
Why am I insecured?

Why my b***h eating on me?
Wtf did I do to hurt her?
And it aint nothing n***a
Why she wanna play with me?
My feelings got nothing wrong
We can stay

Sorry girl, I'm griming
Rest in peace
Now we got 2 daddies

This is a reunion in family
I wanna f**k you girl
Put it on
Baby girl I can get it on
You're the picture
I'mma put you on a wall

Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it

I don't need p***y
But I might eat it
I don't wanna see the b***h
I'm doing my receivings
Her friend never told me
I know she got some cigarettes
And she ain't gonna keep it real with a n***a
Girl I might need you
Let me put my d**k inside the whole

She came rubbing and liked to repeat it
Did she find out?
She might just leave it, yeah
And my lovers got away like a fish tank
Lil money, bang
'til you look back

Give me one plan
I'm leaving with you
When you upset a n***a
Let him track her
No more f*****g lying to a n***a

Why my b***h eating on me?
Wtf did I do to hurt her?
And it aint nothing n***a
Why she wanna play with me?
My feelings got nothing wrong
We can stay

Sorry girl, I'm griming
Rest in peace
Now we got 2 daddies

This is a reunion in family
I wanna f**k you girl
Put it on
Baby girl I can get it on
You're the picture
I'mma put you on a wall

Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it up
Beat it
