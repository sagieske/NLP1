Song:

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my n****s right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 1oo things to do before I die

[Big sean]
Couple n****s on the hitlist and b*****s on a different type
Same s**t different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I aint going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
N****s wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, buddha love
N****s sleepin with that mac and I aint talkin' bout computer love
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to god hoping that you got a christ tag
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, say nay my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

[Hook:]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my n****s right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 1oo things to do before I die

If I just stop breathin', even though I got all this muthafuckin' money
Wont keep my heart beatin'
Just don't let me die
Wake me up
You can't catch me dreamin'
Bout all of this muthafuckin' money
Cocaine rush, I'm speedin'
Cocaine rush

[Royce da 5'9"]
I'm just a detroit n***a, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me
S**t, I'm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm cali swaggin'
My n***a listen, I'm over the fame
You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames, we aint rollin' the same
I'm the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this m*******a big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this m*******a, with no regrets
If you aint living your life for ya kids, I aint giving yo a** no respect
(Sean, I love you my n***a, I'm out)

[Kendrick lamar]
I gotta break ya fu***n' heart
I gotta climb these fu***n' charts (I gotta climb)
I gotta do something that's innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in tijuana with tia and tia's momma
Breakfast in bed with plenty of carne asada (I gotta)
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall, but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this earth, the devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important
The end is near!
