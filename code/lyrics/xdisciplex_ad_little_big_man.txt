Song:

Fly
like an ego with th wind beneath your wings because the worlds got your back or so you think and you're right On
track cast out and sink little big man you stand so tall but in reality you're so small who's the next target You
got them in your sights with your finger on the trigger sacrifice to make you bigger who's got your back
