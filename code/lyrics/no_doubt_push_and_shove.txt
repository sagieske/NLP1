Song:

You can work it, 

Give it to me straight
When you smooth operate
Can you come out and play?
Make my tic talk
Step up to the plate
No underestimate
No, never play it safe
No relax

Boy you're charming me, not gonna fight
I'm your moll indeed, not gonna hide it
Hustlin' you got me
Your turfs in my lane
Respect nobody
Bonnie and Clyde it

Not gonna testify
Gotta me under oath big time
Baby you (hustler, hustler, hustler)
Gonna work for you all night, yeah
Go for whatever you want
Don't let anyone tell you that you can't
Baby you, baby you get that, take that
I'm in the mood so make it last
Hustle 9 to 5
You're gonna have to survive
Go hard, go hard, go hard, go hard
Wanted dead or alive

You work it hard (you work it)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (push and shove)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me
You work it hard (you work it hard you gonna lie some)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (you work it hard gonna survive some)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me

Smoke ina de place
Mi a defend mi space
Give mi food for mi plate
Mi no take talk
Strapped just in case
Anybody violate
Dem quick fe get erases
Cause me squeeze fast
If a high grade weed me provide it
Cops dem search dem never gonna find it
Hustlin' in the street, de turf and de lane
No beg nobody, nuttin' me no join it
Touch de road at night
Make money and mi feel alright
Ghetto youths hustle, hustle at it
Shine like the stadium light, yeah
Go fi whatever you want
No mek nobody tell you say you can't
Ghetto youths set dat, get dat, tek dat
Go fi de food, no mek it pass
Hustle 9 till 5
Cause mi haffe survive
Go hard, harder than de hard drive

Take a ride with me
If that's all right
We'll shine so bright

You work it hard (you work it)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (push and shove)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me
You work it hard (you work it hard you gonna lie some)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (you work it hard gonna survive some)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me

You push and shove
I take the bait
It's a risky business
Gonna play it anyway

Tik tok round de clock
Hustlin' on de block
Make sure everything right fi my girl

The love is non-stop
You feel the impact
Collide like two stars in my world
Ready when you're ready we can run this city
No if's, no buts, no maybes

Seckle down gal, do the rocksteady
Mi put a smile on your face like it's payday

La la la la vida loca
We speeding it up like soca
Just when you think it's over
We be on another level like we doing yoga

My love is toxic, stretch like elastic, drastic
Share the pilot inna mi cockpit

Anytime anyplace we blaze

You work it hard (you work it)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (push and shove)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me
You work it hard (you work it hard you gonna lie some)
Boy you got me good
How you push and shove (you work it hard gonna survive some)
Ooh boy you're hustlin' me

You work it hard (you work it hard you gonna lie some)
Ooh boy you got me good (you got me good)
Baby you got the moves (you got the moves)
You're hustlin' me
You work it hard

Take a ride with me
If that's all right
We'll shine so bright
Like the city lights
When you're by my side
Stay by my side girl (boy)
Let's ride if that what's you want
Have fun if that what's you want
We could go wherever you want girl, want girl
Bubble it it that what's you want
Have a drink if that what's you want
You could have anything you want girl
