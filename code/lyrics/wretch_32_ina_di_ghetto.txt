Ft. Ghetts & Badness

Where straps are seen more than dads
Cos they clap at these boring actors
Cos everyone's big with hard weight
Now everyone thinks they're Scarface
It gets fizzy when their plans evolve
And they end up in the can for coke
I hope you're 7-Up (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
Where we wish for better luck (huh)
But we still see black cats
We get cheese cos we're lab rats (woah)
So then we reproduce
And we grind just to feed our yutes
Gettin' by's like squeezin' through
That's the cycle of me and you
We're designed to lose (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
Where the yutes get high off an 8th
Ride for their name
And love to die for their chain
Just cos he swore on his cross
That if he gets popped then the war's kickin' off
And we'll take it to them
Now that's what I call the chain of events
You break out the chain they're takin' your breath (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
Where there's no congestion charge
But to roll through my hood there's a section pass
I. E to travel these ends
There must be family, friends
Or you're an outlaw
My hoodz a tight space itz hard to get out of
Get lost or found gone
Cos the kids wid da metal are (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
(Huh) and I've come this far
I'm in da ghetto like Justinz yard
Matter of fact Justinz heart

Badness - Chorus
Life is more than rough, see you,
You have to be bold and tough, yoooo
You have to can hold it up? Woaaa
Ina di ghetto, ina di ghetto
(I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)

Ghetto
Uh, I be up from the crack of dawn
I aint aalyiah but I'm back & forth
It's cold but my jacket's warm
And even with the heat on my side
Some how I still manage to catch cold,
My hats low
So my eyes aint seen
Bandana on da neck
Cos I might bang a hammer on a threat
My nine aint clean (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
My name speaks for itself
If I come to a fight
I'ma leave with a belt or chain
But I guarantee you wont leave with your health or name
Everyday I see more pain
I be tryna get doe four ways
In stacks so I couldn't be broke for four days (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
And I scream greengate all day
Cos I'ma greengate gunhappy goon
And before 2007 ask anyone I never had one happy tune
Cos there aint nothing nice round ere
Nuttin but rats n mice round ere
G-H I'm in an unhappy mood (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)
Ni***z are wylin out
Cos there aint nutin 2 smile about
Enemies be tellin me watch when they find me house
I be like mind your mouth
From now everyting on my mind is foul
F**k a nine to five I'm like gimme a nine
A crack a 9 of brown n lemme provide the sound (I-I-Ina Di Ghetto)

Wretch 32
(Huh) and I've come this far
I'm in da ghetto like Justinz yard
Matter of fact Justinz heart

Badness - Chorus X2
Life is more than rough, see you,
You have to be bold and tough, yoooo
You have to can hold it up? Woaaa
Ina di ghetto, ina di ghetto
