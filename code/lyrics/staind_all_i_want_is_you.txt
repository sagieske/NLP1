Song:

What I leave,
When you go,
What I see,
And what you show,
And what I guess,
And when I don't,
Is something you all ready, all ready know,

Chorus:
I can't live without,
All I think about,
All I want is you,
You're all I dream about,
I can't live without,
All I want is you,

The things I do,
I go through,
And all I see,
When I'm awake,
And what I make,
The s**t that I take,
Is something you all ready, all ready know

Chorus:
I can't live without,
All I think about,
All I want is you,
You're all I dream about,
I can't live without,
All I want is you,

Ohhh,...
Is you,
Is you,
Is you,
Is you,
You're all I dream about,
That I can't live without,
All I want is you

Chorus:
I can't live without,
All I think about,
All I want is you,
You're all I dream about,
I can't live without,
All I want is you,
I just can't live without you,
When all I think about is you,
And all I want is you
