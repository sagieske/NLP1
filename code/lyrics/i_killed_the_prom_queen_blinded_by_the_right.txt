Song:

You could be President if your daddy was first
If your brother the governor had the power to coerce
It's absurd but he could change laws so certain votes were heard
For what it's worth, that "democratic" election could be yours

Blinded by the Right

It's the beginning of the end
Now Big Brother is your friend
The Patriot Act enacted allows the government in
To see how you spend, read what you read, jail you indefinitely
And defend they don't intend to end your personal privacy

Blinded by the Right
It's f****d up being seduced by the coalition of Christ

Ignore the Saudis though they backed the 9/11 attacks
Why fight economic allies who share a border with Iraq
Deceive and say Saddam hides weapons that might blow up the us
Let's take him out instead, yeah, and make the Iranians next
We'll feel good about ourselves though Bin Laden is on the run
While Saddam Hussein appears as public enemy number one
Conveniently forgetting it's the Saudis we should fight against
Neglect the un
Ship kids and bring them back in a body bag
Is it a quagmire yet?
I'll bet this ain't as bad as it gets
Just ask your local hero the homeless Vietnam Vet
What was it like losing your friends fighting a cause that wasn't just?
Well, son, it just was what it was, justice I never saw

Blinded by the Right
It's f****d up being seduced by the coalition of Christ

I wish my vote counted
I wish my vote was counted
I was Blinded, Blinded
I wish my vote was counted
Blinded, Blinded
I was
