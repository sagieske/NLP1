Song:

Waltz around the house alone
To the music in your head
Lay in bed on rainy days
And I'll hold you like a child and kiss your head
But all these states are in my way
So I won't be there tonight
But soon the day will come
When I wake up in a bed next to you
I'll wait. I'll wait. I'll wait for you.

Waltz around the house alone
Feel the boards below your feet
But all these states are in my way
So I won't be there tonight
I'll drive all night
And I'll follow the lights to see you again
I'll wait. I'll wait. I'll wait for you.
