Song:

So youve run outa numbers
And youve run outa lovers
They wont deliver that pizza

Youre hungry under the covers
Youre all alone in the moonlight
Got to get ready for daylight

All nite, all nite
Listening to the all nite radio

You could have been sleepin
You could have done anythin
But everbodys singin
Good morin

All nite, all nite
Listening to the all nite
All nite radio
