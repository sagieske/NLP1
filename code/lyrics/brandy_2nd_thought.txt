Song:

Ain't it funny how
Ain't it funny how things always come right back around
How the tables turn
With a little time the ones was up will soon be down
Got me thinking bout
What is was that made me think that you were all so great
Had me sitting round
Tryna figure out what you thought was so wrong with me

You treated me like I wasn't open
Thought you were something
You made it seem like Rocka wasn't that thing
Now you calling again and I was thinking
You almost had me for a minute but I

On 2nd Thought I'm alright
Don't hate me cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't working
Now look who's hurting for a chance to be with me
On 2nd Thought don't drop by
I think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't digging it
Now you so into it on 2nd Thought I'll say goodbye
(Bye, bye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye)

If back then was now
Probably would have said thank you lord for sending him to me
But I found out
That it was better to be hurt back then cause now it strengthen me
So now when you bounce
It was because I put you out not you just leaving me
And your back around
Is it because I won't start giving yourself struggling
You treated me like

You treated me like I wasn't nothing
Thought you were something
You made it seem like Rocka wasn't that thing
Now you calling again and I was thinking
You almost had me fooled for a minute but on 2nd Thought

On 2nd Thought I'm alright
Don't hate me cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't working
Now look who's hurting for a chance to be with me
On 2nd Thought don't drop by
I think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't digging it
Now you so into it on 2nd Thought I'll say goodbye
(Bye, bye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye)

I could never
Let you back into my life
I would never turn back the hands of time
Some things are meant to just fade away
There's no way you
Could ever change everything you done
Wouldn't matter to me cause I moved on
Now I would see something better
In mind [?] You don't

On 2nd Thought I'm alright
Don't hate me cause I changed my mind
I thought that I wasn't working
Now look who's hurting for a chance to be with me
On 2nd Thought don't drop by
I think it'd be a waste of time
Remember you wasn't digging it
Now you so into it on 2nd Thought I'll say goodbye

It didn't have to be this way but
You could have had me anyway but
You chose to do it don't know what led you to it
Now you hurting without me (yeah, yeah)
Should have did me right before now I don't need you no more
