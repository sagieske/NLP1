Song:

You made me cry when you said good-bye.
Ain't that a shame... My tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame... You're the one to blame.
You broke my heart, now we're apart.
Ain't that a shame... My tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame... You're the one to blame.
Ah, yes you are,
Farewell, good-bye, although I'll cry.
Ain't that a shame... My tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame... You're the one to blame.
Ah!
You made me cry when you said good-bye.
Ain't that a shame... My tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame... You're the one to blame.
