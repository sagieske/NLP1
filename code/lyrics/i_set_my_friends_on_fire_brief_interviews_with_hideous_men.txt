Song:

All your marsupial annotations,
That you carry around, may ring.
Through their ears,
But to us make no sound.
We never asked you to squat,
On our intricacies of employment.
But honestly the harder you,
Squeeze facilitates the enjoyment.

Oh just look at all the pretty boggling array,
Of punctuations marks at our disposal slashes.
Dashes and dots of various sorts,
Might even meet our proposal.

Hot flashes,
And rashes I'm feeling,
Particularly pretentious;
Your vasomotor disturbances,
Only rev up our engines.

Dialogue all the shit you want!
But make sure to use the biggest font!
The louder you speak the more they will mention.
Bold or undefined this will get your attention!
