Song:

When my sadness is thin like a withered flower
Unable to fall asleep because of these tangled years
I cling to the rough sigh
That would gnaw deeply into my heart

If I collected tears of a thousand years
Would it be enough to show my heart
At the end of the sky where the sunset glow has left
Today, I linger on again

As the frail sunshine of early dawn
Is woken up by last night's dream
My gloomy dreams of yesterday
Disappear into the legend

If I collected wishes of a thousand years
Would it be enough to show my heart
At the end of the field where the sunshine has left
Today, I linger on again

As the lone wandering low wind
Loses it's way, breathing heavily,
I ease my sorrow in this world
With the raindrops of noon

If I collected love of a thousand years
Would it be enough to show my heart
At the end of the sky where the moonlight is sleeping
Today, I linger on again

If I collected longings of a thousand years
Would it be enough to show my heart
At the end of the field where the rising sun is shining
Today, I linger on again
