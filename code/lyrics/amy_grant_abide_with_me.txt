Song:

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be
Through the cloud and sunshine, O abide with me

Abide, abide with me
Abide, abide with me
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless

I'll have no weight, and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting?
Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou Abide with me

Abide, with me Abide, With me
Abide, abide with me
Abide, abide with me
