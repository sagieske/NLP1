Song:

I mistook the warnings for wisdom
From so called friends quick to advise
Though your touch was telling me otherwise
Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young, I was scared, I was wrong

Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride
When my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home

Guess I did what I was believing
That love is a dangerous thing
Oh but that couldn't hurt anymore than never knowing

Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride
When my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A home

Four walls, a roof, a door, some windows
Just a place to run when my working day is through
They say home is where the heart is
If the exception proves the rule I guess that's true

Not a night goes by
I don't dream of wandering
Through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride
When my heart cried out for you
Now every day I wake again
In a house that might have been
A home
A home
