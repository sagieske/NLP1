Song:

Remember the time we walked through
Cool April showers
It felt so beautiful in the rain
I think of you now through
All the lonely lonely hours
It looked so beautiful in the rain

Could you forget all you told me
When our love was new
Each day your arms would enfold me
Holding me to you
Now teardrops fall like the raindrops
From a cloudy gray
And my world is slipping away

The autumn of love is here with
Sad fading flowers
Once they were beautiful in the rain

Remember the rainbow there in
All of it's splendor
It looked so beautiful in the rain

I think of the words you spoke so
Warm and so tender
It was so beautiful in the rain

Could you forget...

The autumn of love is here
With sad fading flowers
Once they were beautiful in the rain
Once they were beautiful in the rain
