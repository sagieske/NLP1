Song:

Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling

Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling

When the feeling hits you
Show it your gun, yeah
Don't hold back the feeling
Let it go, yeah

Go ahead and do your thing
You don't have to be ashamed
Do just what your soul says do
Go ahead girl get loose, just

Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling

(Do just what your soul says do)
Don't fight the feeling
(Do, do, do, do do just what pleases you)
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight the feeling

Go ahead and do your thing
You don't have to be ashamed
Do just what your soul says do
Go ahead girl get loose, just

(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling

(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling

(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it)
Don't fight the feeling
(Don't you fight it, do it)
Don't fight the feeling
