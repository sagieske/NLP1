MAN (SPOKEN):
Oh, we're late, late, late
We have twenty, maximum twenty-two minutes for your royal fitting
And then it's move, move, move to your speech at the Historical Society
After that we have to rush, and I mean rush to the Horticultural Society Tea
And then there's your Math lesson, your Geography lessons, your Science lessons

Anneliese:
All my life I've always wanted
To have one day just for me
Nothing to do and for once nowhere I need to be
With no lessons, lords, or lunches
Or to-do list in the way
No one to say when to eat or read or leave or stay
That would be the day

Erika:
All my life I've always wanted
To have one day for myself
Not waking up with a pile of work on every shelf
With no hems in need of pressing
And no sleeves in disarray
No wedding gown with a thousand stitches to crochet
And no debt to pay

Erika:
What would it be like to be

Princess anneliese:
What would it be like to be

Erika:
Free

Princess anneliese:
Free

Free to try crazy things

Erika:
Free from endless iou's

Anneliese:
Free to fly

Erika:
Free to sing

Anneliese:
And marry whom I choose

Anneliese:
You would think that I'm so lucky
That I have so many things
I'm realizing that every present comes with strings

Erika:
Though I know I have so little
My determination's strong
People will gather around the world to hear my song

Woman:
Can I come along?

Anneliese:
Now I fear I'll never be

Erika:
Soon I will forever be

Both:
Free

I close my eyes and feel myself fly a thousand miles away
I could take flight but would it be right
My conscience tells me stay

Anneliese:
I'll remain forever royal

Erika:
I'll repay my parent's debt

Both:
Duty means doing the things your heart may well regret

Anneliese:
But I'll never stop believing

Erika:
She can never stop my schemes

Both:
There's more to living than gloves and gowns and threads and seams
In my dreams
I'll be free
