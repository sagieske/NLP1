Song:

Love is crazy baby, I can see it in your eyes.
Your kisses taste the same,
But it's just a sweet disguise.
Ain't that just like you,
To worry about me.
But we promised to be honest
With each other for all eternity.
So if you're looking for a way out
I won't stand here in your way.
And if you're looking for a way out:

Don't look at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay.
Don't kiss me again coz I'm dying
To keep you from running away.
(run away,run away,run away,run away,run away, run away)

Oh baby tell me I'm wrong
Just say I'm crazy
It's with you that I belong.
It's never easy when lovers have to part.
Oh come on stop pretending
Tell me what's in you heart.
And if you're looking for a way out
I won't stand here in your way.
But if you're looking for a way out:

Don't look at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay.
Don't kiss me again coz I'm dying
To keep you from running away.

Don't look at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay.
Don't love me again coz I'm tryin'
To keep you from running away.
(baby don't run away, baby don't run away)

Don't you run away (ooooh oooooh)
(oooooh ooooooh)
Oh come on stop pretending
Tell me what's in your heart.

And if you're looking for a way out
I won't stand here in your way.
And if you're looking for a way out:

Don't look at the tears that I'm crying
They'll only make you wanna stay.
Don't kiss me again coz I'm dying
To keep you from running away.
(run away,run away,run away,run away,run away, run away)

Better tell me what's in you heart

Oh baby now stop pretending, stop pretending, stop pretending.

Don't you know I'll always love you.
