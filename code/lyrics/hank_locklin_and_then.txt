Song:

And then I slowly took you in my arms and held you
And then I found your waiting lips and then I kissed you
And then I closed my eyes and heard you say you never would leave me again

And then and then you said I'll love you till I die
And then and then I woke up and then I started to cry
[ piano ]
And then and then you said...
