Song:

Whoa, yeah!

You say you're getting close to a last chance or suicide,
Tearing at your throat you won't let it die.
Left me here for all these days and ripped apart my pride...

Take my place and look inside, try to find a place,
To hide, hide.
Lost my faith but don't you cry,
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide!

Yeah!
Alright!

Living on the coast, cocktails and telling lies.
Got a f*****g curse that's coming to life.
You left me here for all these days and ripped apart my pride.

Take my place and look inside, try to find a place
To hide, hide.
Lost my faith but don't you cry,
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide.

It's not to late I'm close behind,
Got to get inside your mind, mind.
Lost my faith but don't you cry,
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide.

Take me on I'm feeling in the mood for something dangerous, I've found myself again.
Take me on I'm feeling in the mood for something dangerous, I've found myself again.

Take my place and look inside, try to find a place to hide, hide.
Lost my faith but don't you cry,
I got a hole inside and it's ten miles wide.

Well I lost myself and looked inside it branded me for life,
I can't help myself it's mine to hide.

I got a hole inside
It's feeling ten miles
It's feeling ten miles
It's feeling ten miles wide!

Ten miles wide!
Ten miles wide!
Ten miles wide!
