I'm just a man
Please let me
Sing my song

It's been ten years
Since I met you
And I first held your hand

My suzanne

That summer night
We dreamed of
Days to come

I held you there
Beside me
We carved the wishing tree

And then
We played the part of lovers
On that summer night

We played the part of lovers
You gave all your love and you made it seem right
You made me a man oh so young in my life

One simple verse
Like the words in a play
You spoke your lines
And I knew I must stay
Oh I must stay

Now we are free
And we are growing old
The wishing tree still stands there
And shades our memories

Of when
We played the part of lovers
On that summer night

We played the part of lovers
You gave all your love and you made it seem right
You made me a man oh so young in my life
