Song:

Why did I lose my head and love someone else instead
Cause now he's gone and you're not here to wipe away my tears
I had it all with you and now what am I to do
I'd give the world to find a way to bring back yesterday

I should have known how much you've cared for me
I should have known that we were meant to be
And if I tried to win you back again don't make me wait in vain
I was wrong I can't deny so please don't say goodbye

I made a big mistake and now it's so hard to take
The thought that I would be so blind and leave our love behind

I should have known how much you've cared for me
I should have known that we were meant to be
And if I tried to win you back again don't make me wait in vain
I was wrong I can't deny so please don't say goodbye

Now only time will tell cause I've learned my lesson well,
I've learned my lesson well

I should have known how much you've cared for me
I should have known that we were meant to be
And if I tried to win you back again don't make me wait in vain
I was wrong I can't deny so please don't say goodbye
