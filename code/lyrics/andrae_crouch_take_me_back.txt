Song:

[Chorus:]
Take me back, take me back dear Lord
To the place where I first recieved you.
Take me back, take me back dear Lord where I
First believed.

[Verse:]
I feel that I'm so far from you Lord
But still I hear you calling me
Those simple things that I once knew,
The memories are drawing me.
I must confess, Lord I've been blessed
But yet my soul's not satisfied.
Renew my faith, restore my joy
And dry my weaping eyes.

(Repeat Chorus)

[Bridge:]
I tried so hard,
To make it all alone.
I need your help
Just to make it home.

(Repeat Chorus)
