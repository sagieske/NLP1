Song:

They say we're in a state of emergency
So how come no one is panicking
Where were you when they
Wrote the news
And how are you
Are you feeling blue
The paper doesn't cause
Too much of a fuss
Perhaps it's because it's not, it's not sad enough
Where were you when they
Wrote the news
And how are you
Are you feeling blue
You've never seen the color blue
Call me in the morning
We'll go for toast and tea
Where were you when they
Wrote the news
And how are you
Are you feeling blue
You've never seen the color blue
You've never seen the color blue
We'll you've never
No you've never seen the color
Never seen the color blue
Never seen the color blue
Never seen the color blue
You've never seen the color blue
Oh no you've never seen the color blue oh...
You've never seen the color blue
