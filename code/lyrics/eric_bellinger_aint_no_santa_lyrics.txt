Song:

Won’t you come sit on my lap?
And tell me all your things on your wish list!
I already know you’ve been bad
But I still might let you get your way
If you play your cards right
I don’t really care if you’ve been naughty or nice
Hop on my sleigh, we can ride all night!
Sipping… how you ride all night!

Chorus:
Let’s have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
I want you to a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers

Here’s the boy as.. as the college coming
What stops us, stocks and vodka shots all in my…
The mollie shit that his poppa got,
Daughter spoiled, rotten two
Best plan for all the crew
Momma smokes, so you know I get her leas her zipper too
Easy, the world will jog you if you let them
I bust my ass for the cash,
Kids, it ain’t no Santa
That’s all me!
That’s all me!
What?

Baby, come sit on my lap
I’ll take you around the world in one night
You ain’t gotta…
Cause I’mma have you home by Christmas day!
If you play your cards right
I don’t really care if you’ve been naughty or nice
Hop on my sleigh, we can ride all night!
Sipping… how you ride all night!

Chorus:
Let’s have a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
I want you to a very merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Filled with love and joy and happiness and lots of good cheers
