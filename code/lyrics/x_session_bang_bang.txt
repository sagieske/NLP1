Song:

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

In a dream
a secret in my mind
My love babe
will stand the test of time

Searching for a man
a lover and a friend
I don't know wich way to go
There's so much love
inside my heart
Only one way that I'll know

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

You drive me mad
your body's so devine
Face to face
I gotta know you're mine

Searching for a man
a lover and a friend
I don't know wich way to go
There's so much love
inside my heart
Only one way that I'll know

My heart is going BANG BANG
My heart is going BANG BANG

Bang is the world
when you feel like exploding
Bang goes the door
when you're feeling so strong
Bang is the groove,
Bang is the touch
Bang is the feeling
when it gets too much

My heart is going BANG BANG
