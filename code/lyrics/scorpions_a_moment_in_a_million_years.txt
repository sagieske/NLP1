Song:

The lights are slowly fading down
There's no one else, just you and me nothing ever changed
I see your faces in the crowd
It seems I know each one of you for all my life
I wish this night could last forever, but it's time to go

I saw you laugh, I saw you cry
All for one and one for all nothing ever changed
The way you sang just blew my mind
It gave me chills from head to toe what a glorious night
To me it could have lasted forever, but it's time to go

A moment in a million years is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years to make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget until the day I die
A moment in a million years called life

The bus is waiting right outside
To hit the road and once again I leave you all behind
I chase another dream tonight
And by the time you'll be home I'll be far away
I wish this night could last forever, but it's time to go

A moment in a million years is all I've got for you
A moment in a million years to make some dreams come true
A moment that I won't forget until the day I die
A moment in a million years called life
