Song:

Hello, my friend
Where have you been?
I've been looking you for so long now
I still have faith
Faith in the both of us
I still believe in you.

You treated me rough
That was the worst time of my life
I didn't care what other people
Said
I just wanted you near me

I still have faith
Faith in the both of us
I still believe in you

You gave me all of you're love
You made me pure inside
I can't believe we are over
But you're love did me so good

I still have faith
Faith in both of us
I still believe in you

After all the things you've done
Many people can't believe it
But I can
I still believe in you
Believe in You
