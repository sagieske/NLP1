Gon' be a son-of-a-gun

You know, I'm here
Ev'rybody knows I'm here
And I'm the Hoochie Coochie man
Ev'rybody knows I'm here

On the seventh hour
On the seventh day
On the seventh month
The seventh doctor said

'He's born for good luck
And I know you see'd
Got seven hundred dollars
And don't you mess with me

You know, I'm here

Well, I'm the Hoochie Coochie man

Gon' be a son-of-a-gun

Well, I'm the Hoochie Coochie man
