Song:

I stare at the girl in the mirror
T-shirt, torn up jeans, no beauty queen
But the way that you see me
You get underneath me
And all my defenses just fall away
Fall away

I am beautiful with you
(Even in the darkest part of me)
I am beautiful with you
(Make it feel the way it's supposed to be)
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
I am beautiful with you

I stand naked before you now
No walls to hide behind
So here am I
You see all of my scars
Still here you are
I bear my soul and I'm not afraid
Not afraid

I am beautiful with you
(Even in the darkest part of me)
I am beautiful with you
(Make it feel the way it's supposed to be)
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
I am beautiful with you

I've been the strong one for so long
But I was wrong
Does it make you weak if you're needing someone?
I'm not holding back and I know what I want

I am beautiful with you
I am beautiful with you
You want for myself
You get me like no one else
I am beautiful with you

I am beautiful with you
(Even in the darkest part of me)
I am beautiful with you
(Make it feel the way it's supposed to be)
You're here with me
Just show me this and I'll believe
I am beautiful with you
