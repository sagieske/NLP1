Song:

I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the darkness slowly fall
Into my room as I tear at the walls
And as a million dreams come sweeping by
Soon they will vanish like scattered lies
I reach for light but I cannot flee
An empty reality as all I see
I watch the mutants run their endless race
As I try to forget yet another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
I see the morning light breaking in
Another day, another hell within
Yesterday's sorrows come creeping by
Soon to remind my of tomorrow's lies
I gasp for air I scream for sight
Haven't seen anything yet that seems
To be right
I see the rats run their endless race
As I wake up to face another day...
(I must get... out)
...I'm captured
