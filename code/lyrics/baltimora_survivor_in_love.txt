Song:

Take another song like yesterday
Thinking of the way we used to play
I don't think I'd face it through without you

Tears around a world we leave behind
Something really strange inside your mind
What are we supposed to do, surrender?

Survivor in love again

Make another change, a holiday
Maybe my last chance to hear you say
Let us find a love of ours together

Reflection of our love is in the sky
I can see a teardrop in your eye
Let me feel you close, I can't surrender

Survivor in love again
Survivor in love again

Love me do
I just wanna be the one to help you through
The love I have inside I'll only find in you, yeah
And I don't ever wanna try to hurt your pride, yeah

Hold me do
Those cold and lonely nights out there are not for you
This feeling warm inside I feel will pull us through, yeah
And I don't wanna be the one to hurt your truth, yeah

Take another song like yesterday
Thinking of the way we used to play
I don't wanna go, I am without you

Tears around a world we leave behind
Something really strange inside your mind
What are we supposed to do, surrender?

Survivor in love again
Survivor in love again

Love me do
I just wanna be the one to help you through
The love I have inside I'll only find in you, yeah
And I don't ever wanna try to hurt your pride, yeah
