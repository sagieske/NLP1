Song:

I'm off to school, play on my computer,
My nuki never leaves my mouth.
Even on the playground or on the roller coaster,
I never take my nuki out.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.

All around the world, the places that I show up,
My nuki never leaves my mouth.
Big and strong I'll be when I grow up,
But I'll never take my nuki out.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.

Mama nuki, Papa nuki.
Auntie Susie, Uncle Klaus
Grandma Nuki, Grandpa Nuki
Superman and Mickey Mouse.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.

Nuki nuki nuki - how I love my nuki.
It's mine alone until the end.
Nuki nuki nuki sweeter than a cookie.
I'll share it if you are my friend.
