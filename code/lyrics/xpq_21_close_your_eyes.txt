Song:

Unbalanced intelligent words, intelligent minds
'Cause we're all stupid, that's why we don't understand

And you buy something you don't really like
And you wear something you don't really wear

But at sunrise, the morning light is shining bright

Close your eyes and look around you, 
What you see is what you are and what you get, 
When you do what you think

Close your eyes and look behind you, 
Let me in, into your circle
Let me take a part of your mind... 

Are you prepared for the moment you receive the bright light, 
Following your shadow, penetrating you, the bright light, 

Monumental frights from deep inside, after the rebirth
The conquest of your small world around you, 
It's very close now
