Song:

The stark of grass tasts sweet upon my tongue
The tiny bird begins above to scold me
I stretch my toes up to the morning sun
And dreamed your arms of golden brown
Will always hold me

All of my life I will thank the good Lord
That I've found you
All of my life with my love
I'm going to surround you
Taking the time to proof I love
Sure as you see the stars above you
All of my life Yes all of my life
Filling your life with love

I've shared my world with birds and beasts and space
I needed nothing else to satisfy me
But laying here I see your smiling face
I'm glad I didn't dress until you were beside me

All of my life I will thank the good Lord
That I've found you
All of my life with my love
I'm going to surround you
Taking the time to proof I love
Sure as you see the stars above you
All of my life Yes all of my life
Filling your life with love

Now I knowb why I walked that dusty road
I had to go back where I was to find you
Now I'm not alone within my soul
You turned what was our house into a hold

All of my life I will thank the good Lord
That I've found you
All of my life with my love
I'm going to surround you
Taking the time to proof I love
Sure as you see the stars above you
All of my life Yes all of my life
Filling your life with love
All of my life Yes all of my life
