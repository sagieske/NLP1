Song:

(Words and Music by: Gordon Lightfoot)

The perfume that she wore
Was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on
Long after she'd gone
I remember it well.

And our fingers entwined
Like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway
Womewhere in the night.

Her long flowing hair
Came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down
As I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love.

And she showed me her
Treasures of paper and tin
And then we played a game
Only she could win.

And she told me a riddle
I'll never forget
Then left with the answer
I've never found yet.

How long, said she,
Can a moment like this
Belong to someone
What's wrong, what is right,
When to live or to die
We must almost be born.

So if you should ask me
What secrets I hide
I'm only your lover,
Don't make me decide.

The perfume that she wore
Was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on.
Long after she'd gone
I remember it well...
