Song:

[B. O. B]
Well I got up today
And I put on my shades
And I said I was fine (I'm fine)
But everyone knew that I was lying
If you look at my face
And the way that I behave
You will still see a disguise
Even if you was blind (damn)

[Chorus:]
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye
American Dreaming
American dreaming
It's not that hard to find
Cause most of the time
I'm American sleeping
I barely can see it
But now I'm saying bye, goodbye

As I rhyme and I rap
The average listener is blind to the fact
That my mind has been tapped
I carry the World as it lies on my back
My spine coulda cracked so
Please pay me no mind as I laugh
This is all a stage every line is an act
Killing the American dream with a trap
Like a axe, I'ma put it in a sack
I'ma put it in the back of the black cadilliac
Cause I'm travelling
Some say that I'm throw like a javelin
I'm really tryna expose to the galaxy
Then break off the mould to normalities
People called the election a tradegy
Looking at the screen like this can't be happening
I aint saying that I'm some kind of activist
But someting be attacking us

[Chorus:]

Okay, bring it back
I was filling my time just posing
Like a mannequine you pass by
Tryna make it one day to the big league
Where the girls aint hard to find
All the time I was just searching
A plastic promised land
And I got myself entangled in a corporated plan (sign here)
But a dream is nothing
And it's everything at the same time
So you never know when you might wake up
And find you was just living a lies
Goodbye, just like Trey said
Goodbye America, Goodbye
Cause anything but the truth is a waste of time

[Chorus:]
