Song:

Feat Al Jarreau

Don't now the right words to say
I'm not magic
Don't hold the world in my hands
Wish I could fly to the ear like a hero
But I'm just some one who loves you
That's all I am

Wish I could take you away to a palace
Make you the Queen of a land
All the riches and gold
I don't haven't
I'm just some one who loves you
That's all I am

Love that is pure and secret
I have all you need
And with you that's everything to me
So I'm cherish the moment
I've saw you
I might not give much more than that
But if you look in my heart you'll find
That I'm some one who loves you
That's what I am

So I'm cherish the moment
I've saw you
Life might not give me more than that
But if you look in my heart you will find
That I'm some one who loves you
That's all I am

Some one who loves you
That's what I am

I'm some one who loves you
That's all I am
