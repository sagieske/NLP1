Song:

Hello sweetheart, so how was your day
Well I'm just sittin' here
Thinkin' of you...
I feel like I'm a go crazy...

I can't stand no other minute
Away from your heart
I just wanna get on
The first plane home
And head straight into your arms
Yeah...

I know you miss me shorty
I'm missin' you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there
That I'll be home soon... Yeah

[Chorus:]
I'll be home soon...
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helping our relattion
So I'd rather be there with you... Oh
I'll be home soon...
It's just these time got me stressin'
And I haven't been so patient
'cause I'd rather be there with you oh...

[Verse 2:]
Listen now darlin'...
Don't you worry 'bout a thang
I know it hasn't been
Easy for you babe
But I know we're going to make it
Through this rain yeah...
Sometimes my job gets crazy
And it's hard for me too
But I've got to work hard
No matter the cause
And I do it all for you baby yeah...

Now I that you miss me shorty
'cause I'm missin' you too...
So I swear and I promise
That I will be there...
That I'll be home soon... Yeah

[Chorus:]
I'll be home soon...
(Oh you know that I'll be home with you baby)
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helpin' our relation
And I'd rather be there with you oh...
(I would rather, I would rather be there with you)
I'll be home soon
(I can't wait to see your pretty face baby...)
It's just these times get me stressin'
(Oh no no no no no...)
And I haven't been so patient
'cause I'd rather be there with you oh...(whooh!!!)

I'm so, I'm so missin you baby... Oh... Oh yeah...
I'm still missin you...
But I know we're going to be together, together, together baby...

[Chorus:]
I'll be home soon...(yeah...)
It's just these phone conversations
Ain't helpin our relation
(Ain't helpin our relation)
So I'd rather be there with you oh...
(I'd rather be there, I'd rather be there with you oh)
I'll be home soon...(I'll be home soon baby...)
It's just these times got me stressin'
(Got me stressin'... Oh...)
And I haven't been so patient
'cause I'd rather be there with you oh... Yeah
