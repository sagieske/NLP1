Song:

There was a time when the clocks all stopped
When the world just went away
I didn't know if it was night or day
I didn't know if there were clouds or fire in the sky
I didn't wanna live if I could die

Somewhere down the line I found myself up on that road
Where the devil led me, I would go
I had sold my soul for pleasure, thinkin' it would last
All my hopes had vanished in the past

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark
Driftin' away with the tide
God only knows how I made it back home
I must have an angel on my side

In the mornin' I'd wake up and shake my weary head
Wonder where I'd been and what I'd said
Was I on the River Styx for all eternity?
Would I drown forever in the sea?
Why did anyone keep livin', what was there to find?
I wanted just a little peace of mind

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark
Driftin' away with the tide
God only knows how I made it back home
I must have an angel on my side

Never had a flash of lightnin' comin' right at me
One day I just know I woke up free
The day was breakin', I was livin', I couldn't tell you why
First I laughed and then I learned to cry
Somethin' in my heart was sayin' you can reach the sky
You just gotta live until you die

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark
Driftin' away with the tide
God only knows how I made it back home
I must have an angel on my side
I must have an angel, I must have an angel
I must have an angel on my side
