Song:

Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got s**t on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
F****d with
Pointed at by lesser men

(Pre)

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

[Chorus:]

A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

(Pre)

[Chorus:]

No f*****g surrender
Can't lose
Life kills
