Song:

You don't look like me
You don't sound like me
You don't think like me
But why should it matter
I don't get your deal
I don't see or feel
I don't understand
But why should it matter

If you love me love them too
Let them see my face in you

If I believe what I say I believe
Love is the answer
Look past the lies and the hate and you'll see
Love is the only way
No matter the question
Foreign or friend
Love is the answer
If there's to be any peace in the end
Love is the only way

We go round and round and ignore the sound
I don't have to care
'Cause you are a stranger
How would my point of view
Alter if I knew
There's a chance that you
Could be an Angel

As you treat the least of these
You have done the same to me

If I believe what I say I believe
Love is the answer
Look past the lies and the hate and you'll see
Love is the only way
No matter the question
Foreign or friend
Love is the answer
If there's to be any peace in the end
Love is the only way

Love is the only way
Love is the only way
Love is the only way
God is the only way
God is the only way
God is the only way
God is the only way

If I believe what I say I believe
Love is the answer
Look past the lies and the hate and you'll see
Love is the only way
No matter the question
Foreign or friend
Love is the answer
If there's to be any peace in the end
Love is the only way

God is the only way
