Song:

Am I trying to hard
To Keep this love alive
You don't seem to care
About this love that we had
I called you last night
But you were not there
I didn't here from you at all today

I can't play this game
I'm just wasting my time
You leave me with no other choice
But to say goodbye
I want to work things out
But what's the point of it if
I have to be in love alone
It's not worth it anymore

Heart-
It's hard for me to say goodbye
The tears are falling down my eyes
I'm sorry,
I'm Sorry, but we tried...

17: 28-
I thought we shared a life that was full of love
But now I realize we shared an empty hope
I will cry my last cry
Before I say bye bye
I will sing my last love song for you tonight

I can't play this game
I'm just wasting my time
You leave me with no other choice
But to say goodbye
I want to work things out
But what's the point of it if
I have to be in love alone
It's not worth it anymore

Heart-
It's hard for me to say goodbye
We did out best to make things right
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, but we tried...

17: 28-
I thought we shared a life that was full of love
But now I realize we shared an empty hope
I will cry my last cry
Before I say bye bye
I will sing my last love song for you tonight

I can't play this game
I'm just wasting my time
You leave me with no other choice
But to say goodbye
I want to work things out
But what's the point of it if
I have to be in love alone
It's not worth it anymore
