Song:

Blue summer carpet tween the trees
No longer smothered by the leaves
You bring your sun to light the days
The summertime lightens my ways

Though the rain is falling fast
The summer in your heart will last
Kicking darkness far away
Lighting up the darkest day

Though the discontented,
Misconnected winters come and go
Still you shine as mine
No UV warning needed for this show

So come on now
Let's bring the summer in
Though days are cloudy
Come on now
Let's bring the summer in
Let's change the season
For one reason
Bring the summer in

No sweat marks lurking underneath
No fast acting anti histamines
No need to fear the outside burn
Just be prepared for inside turn

Sky forms the feeling day by day
But you can choose to push away
Any winter of your heart
Bring in summer at the start

So as you plan your steps along
This weather front stays ever strong
No need to pack your water proofs
Just get the sunnys, drop the roof

Live in summertime today
Its burning in you day by day
Every season of your soul
The summers there at your control
