Song:

Sayonara means goodbye
Sayonara and I try, try to be the ones who leaves
Try to be the one who cares

Sayonara means goodbye
Sayonara one more cry
Though today I have to live
I still want you to believe

That since I met you, girl
I've been changing all the ways I live
And there's so much that I want to give
Will you please forgive
'Cause when I look at you
And I feel your lips so close to mine
Wonder whether we could find the time to be together again

Sayonara means goodbye
Let's give our love another try
Don't let your feelings pass you by
You know that it could break your heart

Sayonara, au revoir
But tomorrow I'll be fine
What I need is just a sign
Just a sign and you'll be mine

For since I met you, girl
I've been changing all the ways I live
And there's so much that I want to give
Could you please forgive
'Cause when I look at you
And I feel your lips so close to mine
Wonder whether we could find the time to be together again... Again...
