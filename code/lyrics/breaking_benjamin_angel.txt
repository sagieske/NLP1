Song:

I'm wishing the bath water clean
She hides in the back and is unseen
I take off the mask, that surrounds me
Look me in the face
What do you see?

I feel like a boy the age of 13
My body grows up
But my mind stays the same
Look me in the face
What do you see?

How do you tell an angel
That you don't believe in God?
Why do I feel
Like such a stranger?
I look around, 
I look around
And all my friends are gone

But oh would you be me?
Because I would be you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to

And how would you treat me?
Because I would treat you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to

How do you tell your Father, 
That you want him to notice you?
Why does this seem like such a bother?
When mom says you'd be better off dead
But I want to see you
I still want to see you
Oh would you call me?
Oh it's not hard too
I'm the first one
On your birthday
And oh would you write me
On my birthday
Graduation, was yesterday
Yesterday
Oh... 

How do you hold the special victim?
When they push you away
When they've been... 
Raped on the inside, 
Torn on the outside
The dirt and ugly from the stain, that they try to hide
Touched in private places, 
Embarassed faces
To scared to ask for help

Oh would you be me?
Because I would be you
Oh you'd be happy
Only if you wanted to

And how would you treat me?
Because I would treat you
You'd be happy
Only if you wanted to

I'm wishing the bath water clean
She hides in the back and is unseen
I take off the mask, that surrounds me
Look me in the face
What do you see?
