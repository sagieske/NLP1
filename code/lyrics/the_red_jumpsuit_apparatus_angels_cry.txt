Song:

Well it's hard to explain but I'll try if you let me
Well it's hard to sustain
I'll cry if you let me
This doesn't change the way I feel about you or your place in my life
(please don't cry)
Can't you see I'm dying here?
A shot of broken heart that is chased with fear

Angels cry when stars collide
I can't eat and I can't breathe
I wouldn't want it any other way

Intentions that were pure have turned obscure
Seconds into hours
Minutes into years
Don't ask me why
(please don't cry)
I can't tell you lies

Angels cry when stars collide
I can't eat and I can't breathe
I wouldn't want it any other way.
[repeat]

My heart burns through
My chest to the floor
Tearing me silently although abruptly
Words can't hide as I'm taking you home
And I tried to see
Tried to understand your words as I'm taking you home

Angels cry when stars collide
I can't eat and I can't breathe
I wouldn't want it any other way
[repeat]
