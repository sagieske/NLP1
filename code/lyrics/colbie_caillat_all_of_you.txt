Song:

I know that I was wrong
When I read your letters
But I just had to know
If you still miss her

Cause' you feel far away
When I kiss you
And every word that you say
Sounds so confused

I don't wanna hold you
If you don't wanna stay

Tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beat in part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad

It's you I want
All of you~
You~
You~

No matter what I'm feeling
I won't hide it
You know that you can tell me
Every secret

Cause I'm no good at guessing
I just need to know

Tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beat in part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad

It's you I want
All of you~
All of you~
All of you~
All of you~

So tell me everything
Tell me every little thing
I won't run away
No matter what you say
I wanna hear your heart
Every single beat in part
The good and the bad
I swear I won't be mad

It's you I want
All of this
It's you I want
All of you~
You~
You~

You~
You~
You~

You~
You~
You~
