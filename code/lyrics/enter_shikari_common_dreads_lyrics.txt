Song:

A headless and harrowing future is developing for our generation and generations to come.

But as I walk the chartered street of this familiar oblivion, 
I recognise nothing but unyeilding unconsciousness; 
In which we have almost comfortably drowned.

It is madness
This abnormality is madness! 

We are clinging crippling constraints... 

We must no longer commute
Between brand laden homes
And quickly accepted, aimless roam
From our factories of slavery
To wars of illusive bravery

We must unite

And we must let the flood gates open

Here tonight, I clock a thousand heads
Here to unite, through common dreads
