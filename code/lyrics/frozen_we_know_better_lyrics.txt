Song:

Elsa: Hello little baby, you're princess just like me
Bet you're thinking maybe it's a pretty cool thing to be
But soon you'll see that everyone expects a lot from you
They'll say that there are things a princess should and shouldn't do
But you and me, we, we know better

Elsa and Anna: 1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crown together
Always be together, you and me

1, 2, 3 together, clap together, snap together
You and me together, knees together, freeze together
Up or down together, princess crown together
Always be together, you and me

Elsa: They say a princess is full of charm and grace
They say she always knows her place
They say a princess wears pink and frilly clothes
They say she never laughs and snorts milk out her nose
They say she's calm, they say she's kind
They say she never speaks her mind or freezes nanny's big behind

Both: But you and me, we, we know better

Nanny: You girls are in so much trouble, when I'm gonna tell your father!
Anna: How come you can do that and I can't?
Elsa: I don't know, I wish you could though...

Elsa: They say a princess is super duper sweet

Anna: She doesn't fight; she doesn't sweat

Both: And you never see her eat

Anna: They say a princess doesn't climb and scrape her knee

Elsa: They say a princess wouldn't freeze her tutor's tea

Anna: They say she's poised

Elsa: They say she's fair

Both: She never mentions underwear!

Anna: Or longs to see the world out there

Both: But you and me, we, have big ideas of our own
For the distant someday when we're grown

Elsa: When I'm queen

Anna: And I'm your right hand

Elsa: You'll get to travel

Both: Throughout the land

Anna: I'll tell them of my sister and the magic things she can do

Elsa: We'll take care of our people and they will love

Both: Me and you
No one can tell us what a princess should be
As long as we're together, you and me
