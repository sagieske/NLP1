Song:

Train whistle blowin',
Makes a sleepy noise;
Underneath their blankets
Go all the girls and boys.
Rockin', rollin', ridin',
Out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown,
Many miles away.

Driver at the engine,
Fireman rings the bell,
Sandman swings the lantern
To show that all is well.

Rockin', rollin', ridin',
Out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown,
Many miles away.

Maybe it is raining
Where our train will ride;
All the little travellers
Are warm and snug inside.

Rockin', rollin', ridin',
Out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown,
Many miles away.

Somewhere there is sunshine,
Somewhere there is day,
Somewhere there is Morningtown,
Many miles away.

Rockin', rollin', ridin',
Out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown,
Many miles away.

Rockin', rollin', ridin',
Out along the bay,
All bound for Morningtown,
Many miles away.
