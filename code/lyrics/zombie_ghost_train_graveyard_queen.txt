Song:

Lost my baby on a moonless night,
Our dreams were shattered of our teenage lives.
Her severed head sittin' on my knee,
The words she spoke now haunting me.

I love you, babe and I've been thinkin' all night,
You're arms around me in a bed satin white.
I wanna give it all to you,
Show my love is really true,
Time is right, my cherry's ripe.

In the morgue my baby lying naked no distress.
Her frozen body crying, "take me from this place."
Took my only girl from this lonely world,
To the graveyard she became...

My graveyard queen she's cold and mighty lean,
She's got that morbid sheen,
Yeah, she's my graveyard queen,
My baby is a graveyard queen.

Took my only girl from this lonely world,
To the graveyard she became...

At dark in the graveyard night
I made my girl my queen.
Lovers at last a final gasp,
A coffin set the scene.
Took my lonely life
With a carving knife,
To die beside my haunted dream.

My graveyard queen she's cold and mighty lean,
She's got that morbid sheen,
Yeah, she's my graveyard queen,
My baby is a graveyard queen.

My graveyard queen she's cold and mighty lean,
She's got that morbid sheen,
Yeah, she's my graveyard queen,
My baby is a graveyard queen.
Graveyard queen, graveyard queen, graveyard queen, graveyard queen.
