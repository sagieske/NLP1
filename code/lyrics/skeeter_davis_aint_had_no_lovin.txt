Song:

Ain't done one single thing this morning
Except for crying all alone
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home.

Nothin's been the same since you left me
Everything has gone from right to wrong
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home.

Smiles of yesterday now find me cryin'
The red and golden rainbow turned to blue
With every breath I take I think I'm dyin'
Life just ain't worth livin' when I ain't got you.

Each and every day I've spent without you
Is one more hurtin' lonely day too long
Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home.

Ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
And I ain't gonna get no lovin' till you come home...
