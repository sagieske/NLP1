Song:

24 hours of every day
I'd walk on glass just to hear you say
'Gettin' it on is like a drug to me
I want you baby, can't you see? '

I'm crashed, I'm crushed, and I'm stuck on you
I'd do anything that you want me to
I'd crawl on my knees just to get to you
I close my eyes and girl it's true

On a psychadelic space machine, galactic sugar high
Like a caffeinated satellite goin' way past 99
C'mon be my

21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious
21st century babe, you got solar fire
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer
21st century sha la la la girl

Kiss this, you're blowin' my mind
Never say never, but I'm takin' my time
Girl to the world from the a to the z
I fall for you so easily

Catch my breath 'cause I know too well
That I just can't control myself
Realize we synchronize
It's only when I close my eyes

On a psychadelic space machine, galactic sugar high
Like a caffeinated satellite goin' way past 99
C'mon be my

21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious
21st century babe, you got solar fire
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer
21st century, she's high on flying

Flying, flying
You take me up, you set me free
No time to breathe, just zero g
High, still flying, no gravity
She's flying

On a psychadelic space machine, galactic sugar high
Like a caffeinated satellite goin' way past 99
C'mon be my

21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious
21st century babe, you got solar fire
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer
21st century, high on flying
21st century, sha la la la girl
She's a 21st century, sha la la la girl
21st century, sha la la la girl
She's a 21st century sha la la la girl
