Song:

Ooh, your body, ooh your body's talking girl (X2)

Hit my like an earthquake when you walked in
I can feel my heart race, that's how it begins
You whisper in my ear that you don't want nothing to happen
Cus you got a boyfriend at home

Your triflin' cus you
Are dancin' so close that
I feel every part of you
You must be confused

Your sayin' you don't want it
But your body's talkin' girl
Saying what you wanna
So I, I'll put it on you girl
Who you think your foolin the way
The way your body's movin' let's me know
Cus your body's talking girl (X2)

Ooh, your body, ooh your body's talking girl (X2)

Such a violation you don't play fair
Pushing me away and then you want me here
Sending mixed signals in a nutshell
Girl I'm just a man, don't know what you take me for

It's really what you do
If you only know all the things
I wanna do to you
You wouldn't be confused

Your sayin' you don't want it
But your body's talkin' girl
Saying what you wanna
So I, I'll put it on you girl
Who you think your foolin the way
The way your body's movin' let's me know
Cus your body's talking girl (X2)

Ooh, your body, ooh your body's talking girl(X2)

Girl your body's talking to me
And you don't know what I'd do, I'd do to you
Your words don't mean nothing
Cus your stuck to me like glue, I'm all over you (X2)

Your sayin' you don't want it
But your body's talkin' girl
Saying what you wanna
So I, I'll put it on you girl
Who you think your foolin the way
The way your body's movin' let's me know
Cus your body's talking girl (X4)
