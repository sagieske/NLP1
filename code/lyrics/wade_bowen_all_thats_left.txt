Song:

Heading out, another night has fallen
These empty arms have got something to prove
'Cause they're all that's left of loving you

I washed this jacket half a hundred times
But your smell don't fade away like the blue
It's all that's left of loving you

I turn to sidewalks over memories
Walk these crowded streets 'til they're empty
I talk to strangers, lean on old friends
They hide the silence that comes creeping in the room
'Cause that's all that's left of loving you

This pair of boots you bought me for no reason
They’re looking ragged and the soles are worn clean
Through
They’re all that’s left of loving you

A man plays guitar on the corner
He must feel like me ‘cause all he plays are leaving
Tunes
And that’s all that’s left of loving you

I turn to sidewalks over memories
Walk these crowded streets ‘til they’re empty
I talk to strangers, lean on old friends
They hide the silence that comes creeping in the room
‘Cause that’s all that’s left of loving you

I turn to sidewalks over memories
Walk these crowded streets ‘til they’re empty
I talk to strangers, lean on old friends
They hide the silence that comes creeping in the room
‘Cause that’s all that’s left of loving you
That’s all that’s left of loving you

Closing time, stumble to the taxi
Tell the driver, Eldride Lane 1202
‘Cause that’s all that’s left of loving you
