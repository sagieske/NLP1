Song:

I was twenty one naive
Not cynical, I try to please
Her wit, her speech, her repartee
Impressed me almost instantly

She went all the way
All the way down
She went all the way, all the way

She showed me love a hundred ways
How she pimped and how she paid
All the daughters, all the sons
All were welcome, all would come

We went all the way
All the way down
We went all the way, all the way

I was King, Mr. Cool
Just a snobby little fool
(Like kids are now.)
I dreamed of reaching greater heights
I raved about it every night
Talk is cheap

She went all the way, all the way
All the way down, yeah
She went all the way
All the way all the way
All the way, all the way down

She's there when I close my eyes
There when I close my eyes
She's there when I close my eyes
There when I close my eyes

How the years they rush on by
Birthdays, kids and suicides
Still I play the fool and strut
Still you're a slut

Hey girl, she went all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way, all the way
All the way down

You give me back that time right now
I can see it if I close my eyes
Was every minute just a waste?
Was every hour a foolish chase?
I don't believe it

She went all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way all the way
All the way down
She went all the way
All the way all the way
All the way down
