Song:

Take my mind
And take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And take my past
And take my sense
Like an empty sail takes the wind
And heal, heal, heal, heal

And tell me somethings last,
And tell me somethings last

Take a heart
And take a hand
Like an ocean takes the dirty sand
And heal, heal, hell, heal

Take my mind
And take my pain
Like an empty bottle takes the rain
And heal, heal, hell, heal

And tell me somethings last,
And tell me somethings last,
And tell me somethings last,
And tell me somethings last
