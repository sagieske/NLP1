Song:

I heard a distant early warning
But I chose to ignore it
It came back and bit me
Seems like we're victims of bad timing
Cause you wanted more than I did
I can't give you what you need

She said "hold me, hold me, closely, closely"
That's when I should have ran
3. 2. 1, it's the final meltdown I want out now
I wish I would've known to doubt you
I'm better off alone without you
3. 2. 1, it's the same old story, love gets gory
Why'd we have to go and change things?
Now touching you is such a strange thing

I got so caught up in the moment
That I forgot what it all meant
But still I'd do it all again
You said, "no stings attached, I'm wild"
I didn't know you're in denial
And you became my ball and chain

She said, "hold me, hold me, closely, closely"
That's when I should have ran
3. 2. 1, it's the final meltdown I want out now
I wish I would've known to doubt you
I'm better off alone without you
3. 2. 1, it's the same old story, love gets gory
Why'd we have to go and change things?
Now touching you is such a strange thing

She said "hold me, hold me, closely, closely"
"hold me, hold me, closely, closely"
That's when I should have ran

3. 2. 1, it's the final meltdown I want out now
I wish I would've known to doubt you
I'm better off alone without you
3. 2. 1, it's the same old story, love gets gory
Why'd we have to go and change things?
Now touching you is such a strange thing

She's holding on while she can
Why'd we have to go and change things?
She's holding on while she can
Now touching you is such a strange thing
She's so out of hand
I'm dreading all the baggage and what it brings
She's so out of hand
But still I'd do it all again
