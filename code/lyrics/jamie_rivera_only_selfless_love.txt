Song:

Today in the world where life is born
There's a struggle that is fought
To be welcomed, to be cared for, to be at home

Today when all life seems bought and used
There's a struggled to belong
To be free and to be a gift to everyone

Refrain
We call all families
Rise up and raise your hands as one
Come show the world the love that binds all God's children into one
We call all families
Share the treasure that's in your hands
What can save us now, what can lead us now, what can make us all be one

Chorus
Only selfless love, Jesus show the world
That only selfless love can bring a hundred fold
Of fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, homes
Where peace and mercy reign
Where faith and hope remain
Where life begins and ends in God's embrace
Calling all families
Let's make it happen
Through only selfless love

Bridge
Like the Holy Family
With Jesus, Joseph and Mary
Home is where true love begins
Love rejoices, love embraces

[Repeat refrain]
[Repeat chorus except last line]

Calling all families
Let's make it happen
Through only selfless love
