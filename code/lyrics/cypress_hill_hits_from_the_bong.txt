Song:

Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

Pick it, pack it,
Fire it up, Come along,
And take a hit from the bong,
Put the blunt down just for a second,
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method,
Inhale, Exhale,
Just got a ounce in the mail,
I like a blunt or a big fat cone,
But my double barrel bong is gettin' me stoned,
I'm skill it, There's water inside don't spill it,
It smells like s**t on the carpet,
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit,
Of the skunky funky smelly green s**t,
Sing my song, puff all night long,
As I take Hits from the bong...

Hits from the bong y'all
Gonna get high,
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high,
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high,
Hits from the bong

Let's smoke that bowl, hit the bong,
And then take that finger off of that hole,
Plug it, unplug it,
Don't straaaain, I love you Mary Jane,
She never complains, when I hit Mary,
With that flame, I light up the cherry,
She's so good to me, when I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen,
Don't get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling water,
Is Makin' it pure so I got ta', take my hit and hold it,
Just like Chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it,
Get my four-footer and bring it on...
As I take Hits from the bong,

Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong
Gonna get high
Hits from the bong...
Gonna get high

Straighten your d**k out...
Gonna get high...
