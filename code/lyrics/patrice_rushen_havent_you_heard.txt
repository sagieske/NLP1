Song:

Have you heard that there's an ad
Listed in the classifieds
Kind of brief, it only says
"I'm lookin' for the perfect guy"
Don't you know that

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
Oh, I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}

A gentle touch, a tender heart
A smile to brighten up my day
I need warmth and a lot of love
With kindness spread along the way

Well, anyone can plainly tell
That love is what I want to feel
So my heart is reaching out
To one who's sensitive and real

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
Oh, I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}

{Haven't you heard}
{Haven't you heard}
{Haven't you heard}
{Haven't you heard}

{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you
{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you
{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you
{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you

{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you
{Haven't you heard}
{Haven't you heard} I'm lookin' for you
{Haven't you heard}

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (I'm lookin' for you)
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (Haven't you heard)
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (I need you, I need you)

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (Well, all you, I need you)
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (I'm lookin' for you, I'm lookin' for you)
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard}
(Mmm, caught my eye, you're the perfect guy, yeah)
I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...)

I've been lookin' for you {Haven't you heard} (I'm lookin', lookin' for you)
I've been lookin' for you
