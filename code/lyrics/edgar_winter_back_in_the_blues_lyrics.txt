Song:

I may not be your way back in the blues
But the blues is back in me
I may not be the same as you
But I'm the same as I can be

I may not walk the way I talk
But I get there just the same
Lord, I mean I play the same as You
Yet I don't play the game

I may not be the sound of blues
But I can live that sound
I may not be around the world
But I can make the world be round, yeah

I can't dig the sound of blues
I can't dig the sound
I can't make the world be round
Make the world be round
