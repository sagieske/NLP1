Song:

I've been there a thousand times
Felt the rain like a thousand knives
And it hurts
I know it hurts

I've been there like a fighter plane
Trying to fly my way through a hurricane
And it's hard
I know it's hard

Don't be afraid
You'll make it through
Just call out to me and I'll come running to you

[Chorus:]
And hold on
Hold on when the current pulls you under
And your heart beats like thunder
Just give me your hand and hold on
Hold on until the storm is over
And I'll be fighting for you
Just give me your hand and hold on

I'll give you hope, I'll give you faith
And if it's dark I'll light the way for you
For you

By your side until the end
Until you're standing tall again
I'm here
I'll always be here

And if the tide sweeps you out to sea
When your strength is gone
And it's hard to believe

And hold on
Hold on when the current pulls you under
And your heart beats like thunder
Just give me your hand and hold on
Hold on until the storm is over
And I'll be fighting for you
Just give me your hand

Hold on

So hold on when the current pulls you under
And your heart beats like thunder
Just give me your hand and hold on
Hold on until the storm is over
And I'll be fighting for you
Just give me your hand and hold on

Hold on
