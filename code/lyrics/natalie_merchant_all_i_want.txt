Song:

[ Joni Mitchell ]

I'm on a lonely road and I'm traveling,
Traveling, traveling, traveling,
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some,
Oh I love you, when I forget about me,
I wanna be strong, I wanna to laugh along,
I wanna belong to the living,
Alive, alive, I wanna get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some juke box dive

Do you want? Do you want?
Do you want to dance with me, baby?
Do you want to take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby?
Well, come on.

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you

I want to talk to you,
I want to shampoo you,
I want to renew you again and again,
Applause, Applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses,
My mind see-saws,
Do you see, do you see, do you see, how you hurt me, baby
So I hurt you too, and we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling, it's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be

I want to have fun,
I want to shine like the sun
I want to be the one that you want to see
I want to knit you a sweater,
I want to write you a love letter,
I want to make you feel better,
I want to make you feel free
Oh oh oh, I want to make you feel free,
I want to make you feel free
