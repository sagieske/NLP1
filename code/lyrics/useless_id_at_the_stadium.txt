Song:

Would I Worry If I Wouldn't Care At All
It Is 3 Am Here, Waiting For Your Call
Yet Another Day Has Gone By And I Haven't Heard From You
Thursday's Got Me So Confused

It Is Really Odd That Things Are Going Great
One Foot In The Worst, The Other For The Best
My Mind Has Signed A Petition That Is Going All To You
It Feels Like A Dream Although It's True

Wrong Turn Today, We Can't Find Our Destination
One Hour Late, Empty Beds And Still I'm Missing You

A Timing Questioned For This Brand New Start
But At The Stadium It All Came From The Heart
I Would Play You All The Tunes That I Know You Would Love To Hear
In Other Words, Won't You Be My Dear?
