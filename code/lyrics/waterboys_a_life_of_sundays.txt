Song:

Hold me!
Before I go under.
Hear me!
Before I drown.
Sharpen!
Your sense of wonder.
Listen!
To what I've found.

Here we are again,
Two old lovers,
Two old friends,
Just when you need them.

A devil was standing on my shoes
Somehow I know how to defeat him
Since Itumbled into you.

You taught me love and pain,
And the unsung King or Ireland
Says the same thing,
Wherever you find it.

(the whole world wide over)

The same thing from the same old cause.
The same thing - I cannot define it.
It is the same thing and it always was.

It struck me sad and strange,
All that ever stays the same
Is change...

... And I dreamed I wandered
Wayward as a restless wave.
Spanning from here to yonder
Most spectacularly saved.

Dream and life entwined,
The old day cracks and crumbles
And it's

Fine!
To be in your company.
Funny!
To be in your day.
A miracle!
Just to be with you.
Glad!
To be going your way.

Were these unfolding plans
Designed and drawn by mortal hands?
Never in a life of Sundays
Would I have seen me here.
