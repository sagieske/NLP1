Song:

Hello again - it's me, the fool on the hill
Life here aint so bad
My friends are tired - their lives are wasted
Just like their moms and their dads
And they don't know what I am talking about
And they may never know
I'm just fourteen - but I know where I stand
Behind these walls - life aint so easy
But it's turned me into a man
Sometimes I don't know what I am talking about
And I may never know
Far away - the cool taste of reality
Far away - perfect little family
Far away - the little boy I used to be
Look at my eyes - maybe they'll show you the truth
The truth I cannot see
Once in a while I catch a glimpse of it all
But it slips away from me
Someday I'll know what's going on in my head
For now, I'll just stay here
Far away - the cool taste of reality
Far away - perfect little family
Far away - the little boy I used to be
Far away
I hate it when they look right through you
It sends me into a rage
I know I aint crazy - and I don't need your proof
I just need out of this cage
Hello again - it's me, the fool on the hill
Life here aint so bad
