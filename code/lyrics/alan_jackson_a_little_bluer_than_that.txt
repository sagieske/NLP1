Song:

Well tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that

When you look out in the morning you might see
Clouds rolling by like memories
A big old sky above you lookin' back
You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that

Chorus
Where did we go wrong
I wish I knew
It haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and
Whatever I do
You're always on my mind

I can picture you in his arms tonight
But as for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
It may work for you
But I'm a little bluer than that

Chorus

So tonight if you turn your radio on
You might hear a sad, sad song
About someone who lost everything they had
It may sound like me
But I'm a little bluer than that

You may think of me
But I'm a little bluer than that
