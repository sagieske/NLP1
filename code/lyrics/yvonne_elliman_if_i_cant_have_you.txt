Song:

Don't know why
I'm survivin' ev'ry lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears, so far, are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

Chorus:

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you... Uh-huh, oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you... Uh-hoh

Oh... Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Oooh, oooh
Aahhhh! Aahhhh!

Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

[Chorus:]

Oh!

Aahhhh! Aahhhh!

Oh!

(Chorus X 2 with ad-libs, fade)
