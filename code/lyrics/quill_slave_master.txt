Song:

Who is the slave if I am the master?
Who is the fool if I am the sane?
Well whoґs the saddest soul around?
Whoґs the saddest soul around?

On some kind of verge, no parole for the holy
No rest for the sleepless, I got pills to spare

Who is the slave, yeah if I am the master?
Who is the future, if you say Iґm the past?

Well whoґs the saddest soul around?

Itґs killing me, well, yeah Iґm killing myself
All you morphine minds are winding up in hell
Whoґs the saddest soul around?
Well whoґs the saddest soul around?

Who is the devil if I am God?
Who is the sinner if I am the saint?

Whoґs the saddest soul around?
Whoґs the saddest soul around?
