Song:

I used to drink my whiskey, careless, fast and dark
Went good with lonely underneath the crooked stars
But that's a million miles away from where we are tonight
Tonight

Let's slow it down and put a timeless record on
'Round and 'round, girl, let's get tangled in a song
Let's pour a glass of what's been waitin' all along, baby
Ah, baby

Chorus:
Summer goes with sunsets like ragtops with Corvettes
Blue jeans and back roads just like your hand in mine, like
Shadows to the moonlight, cool breeze to a hot night
Like rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with wine

I wanna soak you up, breathe you in like air
Get lost within the sparks flying everywhere
Baby, I can't help it if I'm pouring out my soul
Let's lose ourselves and find ourselves
'Cause baby, don't you know that

Repeat Chorus

Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, ohh
Midnight and sweet dreams, love songs and six-strings
Baby, it's a good thing, I'm yours and you are mine, like
Shadows to the moonlight, cool breeze to a hot night
Like rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with
Rock to the roll, sun to the shine
Baby, you go good with wine

Good with wine (X3)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
(Good with wine gonna drink you up)
(Good with wine gonna fill my cup)
(Good with wine gonna drink you up)
(You go good with wine )
