Song:

Verse 1:
It's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here
Rhinestone suits and new shiney cars
We've been the same way for years
We need to change

Verse 2:
Somebody told me when I got to Nashville
Son you finally got it made
Old Hank made it here, we're ll sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
I don't think Hank done it this way

Verse 3:
Ten years down the road, making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time just so I understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way
Did Ol' Hank really do it this way?

Verse 4:
I've seen the world with a five piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done it this way
No I don't think Hank done it this way.
