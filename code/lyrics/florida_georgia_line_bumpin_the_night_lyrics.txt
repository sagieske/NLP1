Song:

The week was long but now it's gone, the drink is on
So fill your cup and turn the good time music on
And pick up that sweet somebody
Wrap your arms around this Friday night
And get a little lost in the party flow
Juke trouble like a champagne bubble sing
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah

Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night
Two crazy hearts looking in the dark
For a place to park it to the light
Find an old school A and B
And put a little shine on the vinyl seat, yeah
Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night

The night is young, the night is free and so are we
So let it out and let me step inside your dreams
Lipstick on long, sipping star, line on the window
Dripping down off in the distance, the lights of town
Can't you see it now?

Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night
Two crazy hearts looking in the dark
For a place to park it to the light
Find an old school A and B
And put a little shine on the vinyl seat, yeah
Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night

(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah

Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night
Two crazy hearts looking in the dark
For a place to park it to the light
Two shots of Patron, don't want to go home
Two AM in the morning, just you and I
Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night

(Yeah-eah-eah-eah) yeah-eah-eah-eah just bumping the night
(Yeah-eah-eah-eah)
Two bottles of Bud, two speakers in the trunk
Two people in love just bumping the night
