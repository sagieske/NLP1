Al-di-la means you are far above me very far
Al-di-la as distant as the lovely evening star
Where you walk flowers bloom when you smile all the gloom turn to sunshine
And my heart openes wide when you're gone it fades inside
And seems to have died.

Al-di-la I wonder as I drifted where you were
Al-di-la the fog around me lifted there you were
And the kiss that I gave was the love I have saved for the lifetime
Then I knew all of you was completely mine.

And the kiss that I gave was the love I have saved for the lifetime
Then I knew all of you was completely mine.

La la la la la la la la la la la la...
