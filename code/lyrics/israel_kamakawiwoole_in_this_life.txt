Song:

For all I've been blessed with in my life
There was an emptiness in me
I was imprisoned by the power of gold
With one kind touch you sent me free
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true
In this life I was loved by you
For every mountain I have climbed
Every raging river crossed
You were the treasure that I longed to find
Without your love I would be lost
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me love's not worth going through
If it all falls apart
I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true
In this life I was loved by you
I know that I won't live forever
But forever I'll be loving you
Let the world stop turning
Let the sun stop burning
Let them tell me loves not going through
If it all falls apart I will know deep in my heart
The only dream that mattered had come true
In this life I was loved by you
