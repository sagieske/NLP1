Song:

Smiling faces, sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within(can you dig it? )
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof
Oh Lord yeah...

Let me tell ya, The truth is in the eyes 'cause the eyes don't lie, amen
Remember, a smile is just A frown turned upside down, My friend
So hear me when I'm saying
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, Hey They don't tell the truth, Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies, and I got proof
Beware, beware of the handshake that hides the snake
I'm a telling you beware, Beware of the pat on the back, It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy) Misery (misery) Envy, (envy)
Until you can't see behind smiling faces, Smiling faces sometimes, hey, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces Tell lies and I got proof
Heyyy, your enemy won't do you no harm, 'cause you know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice I'm only tryin' to school ya
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces Tell lies and I got proof (Smiling faces)
