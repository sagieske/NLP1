Song:

They say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away
Forget the love I had for you

Guess I could find somebody new
But I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Before you leave, be sure you find
You want his love much more than mine
'Cause I'll just say we've never met
If I'm that easy to forget

They say you've found somebody new
But that won't stop my loving you
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?

Guess I could find somebody new
But I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?
