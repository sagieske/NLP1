Song:

The day I chose to give my life to You
Is the day that everything began to change
The problems that I faced
Were getting stronger
I thought when I got saved
My problems would go away
But the change I made
Began to really take a toll onme
And when I told my friends about You Lord
The laughed hysterically
But no matter what they say
Or what they choose to thinkof me
I'm gonna stay here strong
For You my Lord
No matter what the cost may be
I'm gonna serve You
Because I love You
I'm going with You
All the way
When friends forsake me
I won't let it break me
I'm going with You
All the way
All the way
Now the problems that I face are getting smaller
Because my faith in You
Is getting oh so strong
The peace and love from You
It keeps me standing
Through anything I go through
I know that I can't lose
'Cause the more I pray
The more I feel Your strength inside of me
And the more I seek Your face
I find You're all I really need
And this feeling that I feel
I've never felt since I've been free
I'm gonna stand here strong
For You my Lord
No matter what the cost may be
