Song:

When the little girl was two, her daddy went off to war, 
She didn't understand why, until she was four, 
She went to ask her mama, when is daddy coming home, 
Her mama looked down at her and said, soon I hope, 
And every night before this little girl goes to bed, 
She kneels and prays and this what she says, 

Daddy, please come back home
I miss you, and me and mama are all alone, 
Daddy, I don't need a letter, 
I need you to make things better
Daddy, please come back home

This little girl's hopes and dreams slowly disappear, 
Her Daddy's still not home, she's been waiting for over a year, 
She went to ask her mama, when is daddy coming home, 
Her mama looked down at her and said, soon I hope
And every night before this little girl goes to bed, 
She kneels and prays and this what she says, 

Daddy, please come back home, 
I miss you, and me mama are all alone, 
Daddy, I don't need a letter, 
I need you to make things better
Daddy, what's it like over there, 
Daddy, are you scared

Daddy, please come back home, 
I miss you and me and mama are all alone
