Song:

It's a big bright beautiful future
Thank you your lucky stars, you're alive
You've got someone special to talk to
A friend that you can trust for life

You've been on your own with no family ties
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind
Spending quality time
Together as father and son

Building model ships
Taking fishing trips
Warking hand in hand
Painting the palace and moving the sand
First ten to go, with your daddy-o
Once you break the ice
You can postulate palernal advice

It's a fine fantobulous future
I see fruitt on the family tree
You'll be great as the grumpy old grand-pa
Bouncing babies on your knee
You can fall asleep on the comfy couch
After playing one on one
Dreaming back to back
That you walloped the Shoq
Together as father and son

Maybe a bumpy ride
We'll make it side by side
Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Moreover, Laddie, Make room for Daddy Gotta
Whole new shoulder to cry on

Take a chance now give it a spin
You've had chums for palin' around with
But you've never had a friend like him

Put your checkered past behind you now
No more living on the run
Face the big bright beautiul future
Together as father and son
