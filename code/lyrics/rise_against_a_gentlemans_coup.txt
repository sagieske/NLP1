Song:

The pain, disorder
A cataclysmic dawn
We trusted but something has gone wrong
We bought it
But woke to find it gone
Impact in 5, 4, 3, 2

The place before
The radiation creeps
On cats' feet
We scatter in the streets
She asks me "do you think it's safe to breathe?"
It doesn't look that way to me

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoah... 
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough

Afraid, we cower
To interests not our own
The power to free or to control
We let it slip through
Our fingers to the floor
Watch as the bodies wash ashore
Whoah... 
Nobody lives here anymore

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoah... 
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough

And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
How long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall?

And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
And how long will we fall for this?
How long, how... ?

We storm the gates
Raise the flags
Just the same old story
We seize the throne, subjugate
We should have burned it to the ground
Whoah... 
Some might say we've lost our way
But I believe we've not gone far enough
