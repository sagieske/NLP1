Song:

By Tom Petty

Rickey and Dickey
Standing in the sun
Out there on that highway and the dog wouldn't run
Rickey rolled a number
Dickey raised the hood
Time we hit Daytona I was feeling pretty good

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out

Karaoke Katie drove the crowd wild
Every time she'd sing they'd come in for miles
Curtain came up
Katie came on
Drinking like a lumberjack
And singing Delta Dawn

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out

Yeah, I hit town hard last night
Abraham and Moses
Some other friends of mine
Moses started drinkin' he got a little rude
We woke up in the bushes
Beat to Hell and nude

Oh, mama I'm about to give out
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm Davey Crockett in a coonskin town
Oh, mama, I'm about to give out
I'm Roy Rogers in a one horse town
Oh, mama I'm about to give out
I'm about to give out
