Song:

Believe in your heart
No matter what the people may say
The chance you take could take you to the top

Listen up
You know you gotta throw fear away
Together we can make it
Shake it up baby

Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies
I can see eternity, is in your eyes
Come on everybody there's a party to go to
There holding out for you
With every chance you take
A change you make
The start of something new

All around the world they're singing
Calling out a new beginning
Celebrate our love
People with imagination
Every where a celebration
Celebrate our love

Good to be free
Living out our own destiny
The beat will last forever
Never stop

Gotta move
You know we gotta groove into the light
Tonight will be the night that
We're breaking it up
Break it down baby

Hear the voices rock the nation
A calling to the skies
I can see eternity, is in your eyes
Come on everybody there's a party to go to
There holding out for you
With every chance you take
A change you make
The start of something new

All around the world they're singing
Calling out a new beginning
Celebrate our love
People with imagination
Every where a celebration
Celebrate our love

Let the rhythm take control
Feel the fire burn within your soul
There's a magic in your eyes
Forever we can take the
Music through the night
