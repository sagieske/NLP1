Song:

If you're feeling lonely
And think you're the only
One left
That's alone in a bar
If need somebody
With shoulders to cry on
Well baby I'm not very far

Chorus:
Just look for my name on a jukebox
When you're tired and feeling alone
Put in a dime
And I'll take the time
To sing you
A sad country song

If you started drinking
Still can't stop thinking
About all those long nights alone
If tear drops start falling
And you keep on calling
To find out there's nobody home

Chorus:
Just look for my name on a jukebox
When you're tired and feeling alone
Put in a dime
And I'll take the time
To sing you
A sad country song
