Song:

Hey there fear...
I've seen you here before
You keep coming back
And knocking on my door
For so long, so long
I've been trying to soar
With my hands tied up and my feet held to the floor

But I'm feelin' like a breakthrough is comin'
I can see that a breakthrough is comin', comin' for me
'Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough

You used to have me stumblin'
Yeah, trippin' again and again
But I've been studyin' you
And now I know you like the back of my hand
You can't keep me here
I've cried too many tears
Yeah, I've had enough
Now I'm gonna call your bluff
You made your bet, but the stage is set get ready
'Cuz I'm lightin' the fuse

But I'm feelin' like a breakthrough is comin'
I can see that a breakthrough is comin', comin' for me
'Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough

I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'
I can feel a breakthrough comin'

A breakthrough is comin'
I can see that a breakthrough is comin', comin' for me
'Cause my heart, it was made to fly
Destiny can't be denied
I'm tired of waiting
I am overdue for a breakthrough
