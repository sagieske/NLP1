Song:

When we were growing up
You always looked
Like you
Were having such fun
You always were
And you always
Will be the taller
And the prettier one
People seem to love you
They gravitate towards you
That's why I started
To hate you so much
And I just completely
Ignored you

I don't know
Why I felt the need
To keep it up for oh so long
It's all my fault I'm sorry you
Did absolutely nothing wrong
I don't know why I felt the need
To drag it out for all these years
All the pain I've caused you
The constant flow of all the tears
Believe me when I say
That I cannot apologise enough
When all you ever wanted from me
Was a token of my love
And if it's not too late
Could you please find it deep
Within your heart
To try and go back
Go back to the start
Go back to the start

I've been so evil
With my constant invasions
But you made it so easy for me
You always rise to the occasion
I'll always pull you up
On every stupid thing that you say
But I found it so entertaining
Messing around with your head

I don't know why
I felt the need
To keep it up for oh so long
It's all my fault I'm sorry you
Did absolutely nothing wrong
I don't know why
I felt the need to drag it out
For all these years
All the pain I've caused you
The constant flow of all the tears
Believe me when I say
That I cannot apologise enough
When all you ever wanted from me
Was a token of my love
And if it's not too late
Could you please find it deep
Within your heart
To try and go back
Go back to the start
Go back to the start
Go back to the start
Go back to the start

This is not just a song
I intend to put
These words into action
I hope
That it sums up the way
That I feel
To your satisfaction

I don't know why I felt
The need to keep it up
For oh so long
It's all my fault
I'm sorry
You did absolutely
Nothing wrong
I don't know
Why I felt the need
To drag it out
For all these years
All the pain
I've caused you
The constant flow
Of all the tears
Believe me when I say
That I cannot
Apologise enough
When all you ever
Wanted from me
Was a token of my love
And if it's not too late
Could you please
Find it deep
Within your heart
To try and go back
Go back to the start
Go back to the start
