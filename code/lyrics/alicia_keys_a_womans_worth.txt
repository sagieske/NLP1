Song:

Alicia Keys
A Woman's Worth

[Verse:]
You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby, you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candles
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last, and last
Baby, you know I'm worth it

[Bridge:]
Wanna' please; wanna' keep; wanna' treat your
Woman right?
Not just dough, or a show, let her know she's
Worth your time
You will lose, if you choose, to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth!
Mmmmmmmmm

[Chorus:]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he
Sees her (when he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man
Ain't 'fraid to please her (please her)
And a real woman knows a real man always
Comes first (first)
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth

Mmmmmm hmmmmm (x1), Mmmmmm hmmmmm (x1), Mmmmmm hmmmmm (x1), Mmm

(Hold up)

[Verse 2:]
'Cause If you treat me fairly
I'll give you all my goods...
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby, I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I'll hold you down when s**t gets rough
'Cause baby, I know you're worth it

(Bridge 2)
She walks the mile; makes you smile, all the while
Being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has
For you
You will lose, if you choose, to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows
Her worth!
... Oh!

[Chorus:]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he
Sees her (when he sees her)
And a real woman knows a real man
Ain't 'fraid to please her (please me)
And a real woman knows a real man always
Comes first (first, baby)
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth

[Breakdown]
No need to read between the lines
Spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Just hear this song
'Cause you can't go wrong when you value(Better value...)
A woman's, woman's, woman's, woman's Worth! (yeah)

[Chorus (x2)]
'Cause a real man knows a real woman when he
Sees her (when he sees her[1st time]) (nothin' like a woman's worth [2nd time])
And a real woman knows a real man
Ain't 'fraid to please her (please me [1st time]) (ohhh, ooh [2nd time])
And a real woman knows a real man always
Comes first (first, baby [1st time]) (comes first [2nd time])
And a real man just can't deny
A woman's worth (a woman's worth)

Mmmmn hmmn
