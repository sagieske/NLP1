Song:

I kick the music so hard
People get injuries
Step to me, be a big stitch mc
Lyrics I chop, kick skills like jacky chan
Many props, loot, gladly pay the tax man
Flex plans, leave bodybags full o' men
Kick a tune like a can
Scratch heads with stray cat
I'm steady shapin' on these apes
Plus the squad took some time off, with the wild funk
So what?
You figure, you bigger when you fill the void
I got the stacks to check yo head
Like the beasty boys
I heard your airplay 'n tracks,
Bullshit 'n flack, men on stage,
Pamper trainers lacked,
Droppin' voodoo on doo doo
I'm mad defiant cuttin' armchairs with knives
Airplay keep tryin', foolin' the flock,
What up?, I'm straight up sleepin' skeletons
With microphones, who's grimreapin'

It's the demagogue
It's the demagogue
Hear the demagogue, funky demagogue
Look and learn with the demagogue

Six six six clone take a pick,
Snail bits, fail as dish
I eat galactic, poltergeist plus heist,
Plus I rip s**t
Weak minds say rhymes combined with crucifix
Chairs go up, hair go up, fleas fall over
Ego puffed?, watch me go off!
Doper with flair, deliver trauma 'n nightmare
You duck with hunchback as I punch back
With rap bat dust
'n bust off antique metaphore
Jurassic park raw, I'm carnivore,
You omnivore, I flow fat on tracks,
Like kids called fat joe
Lyrics on diet, when you tried on wax so bogus
I focus, play hocus-pocus,
Yo homes, I plague domes like locust,
Mc's cup ear, better hear some authority
Lyrical gestapo, introducin' tha majority

Wanna see a joke, check a look-a-like
Wanna see a joke, check a look-a-like
Wanna see a joke, check a look-a-like

Lyrical mass I bash 'n flex it
Perfect bionic atomic,
When germs hit styles not really matched up
In atmosphere rags pushed 'n dressed up
Shoot missiles that sizzle, carve scars on yo
Rhymes take off like planes from la guardia
I stand solid on bedrock, called new york,
You gotz beef? I eat it with knife 'n fork
Foul like a pig on a bum
Beggin' for some knight stick to lyric
Billy-clubbin' 'em, now oh' what look up!
See what yo took up!
Weak raps make no bail, you keep booked up
Mc's learn quick, the kid wears no badge
Stupid brain, restrain, with plasters 'n padge
Now give me room, watch me bloom like kurt cobain
Attract a million ears, make 'em all insane
