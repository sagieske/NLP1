Song:

I see no, hear no evil,
Black writings on the wall,
Unleashed a million faces,
And one by one they fall,

Black hearted evil,
Brave hearted hero,
I am all, I am all, I am,

(I... I... I...)

I am,

Here we go buddy,
Here we go buddy,
Here we go,
Here we go buddy,
Here we go,

Go ahead and try to see through me,
Do it if you dare,
One step forward, two steps back,
I'm here (One step forward, two steps back)

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mysteries?
Step inside and hold on for dear life,
Do you remember me?
Capture you, or set you free?
I am all, I am all of me
(I am all, I am all of me)

I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,

I see and feel the evil,
My hands will crush'em all,
You think you have the answer,
I laugh and watch you fall,

Black hearted evil,
Brave hearted hero,
I am all, I am all I am,

(I... I... I...)

I am,

Here we go buddy,
Here we go buddy,
Here we go,
Here we go buddy,
Here we go,

Go ahead and try to see through me,
Do it if you dare,
One step forward two steps back,
I'm here, (One step forward, two steps back)

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mysteries?
Step inside and hold on for dear life,
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free?
I am all, I am all of me,
(I am, I am all of me)

I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,

(Here We Go...)

I am...
I am everyone, everywhere, anyhow, any way, any will, any day...
I am...
I am everyone, everywhere, anyhow, any way, any will, any day...
I am! I am! I am!
I am! I am! I am!

I am!

Do it... Do it... Do it... Do it...

Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mysteries?
Step inside and hold on for dear life.
Do you remember me?
Capture you, or set you free?
I am all, I am all of me.
(I am, I am all of me!)

I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,
I am... I am, I'm all of me,

(Here We Go...)

I am, I am, I'm all of me
