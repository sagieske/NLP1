Song:

The sun shown bright and clear that day
We all left Washington
To lick the Rebel boys in grey
At the Battle of Bull Run
They came from Pennsylvania and some from Maryland
To see the Rebel boys get spanked by Honest Abe's broad hand

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

The ladies wore their brightest shawls
The gentlemen were g**
They came to see their Yankee boys whip old Virginia
I held my momma's hand and skipped
When a soldier said to me
Would you rather have Jeff Davis' hat or the sword of Bobbie Lee

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

And then the general doffed his hat and said let's rest a spell
And for the first time we all heard that awful rebel yell
The waters of manassas creek became a ruby red
And many a Reb and Yankee boy lay in the willows dead

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia

A fight locked in the chest of time too horrible to tell
Virginny's true green countryside became a lake of hell
Don't count your chicks before they're hatched
Or you'll work until it's done
Remember yes remember long the Battle of Bull Run

We said we'll run 'em to Atlanta and to Galveston Bay
But they ran us back to Washington and Philadelphia
And Philadelphia
