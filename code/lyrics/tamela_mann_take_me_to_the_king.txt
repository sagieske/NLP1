Song:

Chorus:
Take Me To The King
I don't have much to bring
My heart is torn in pieces
It's my offering
Take Me To The King

Verse 1:
Truth is I'm tired
Options are few
I'm trying to pray
But where are you?
I'm all churched out
Hurt and abused
I can't fake
What's left to do?

Truth is I'm weak
No strength to fight
No tears to cry
Even if I tried
But still my soul
Refuses to die
One touch-will change-my life

Chorus:
Take Me To The King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn into pieces
It's my offering

Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And sing to You this song
Please Take Me To The King

Verse 2:
Truth is it's time
To stop playing these games
We need a word
For the people's pain

So Lord speak right now
Let it fall like rain
We're desperate
We're chasing after you

Bridge:
No rules, no religion
I've made my decision
To run to You
The healer that I need

Chorus:
Take Me To The King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn to pieces
It's my offering

Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And to sing to You this song

Take Me To The

Lord we're in the way
We keep making mistakes
Glory is not for us
It's all for You

Chorus
Take Me To The King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn to pieces
It's my offering

Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And sing to You this song
