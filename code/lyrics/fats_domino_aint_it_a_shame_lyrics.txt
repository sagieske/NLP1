You made me cry
When you said good-bye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh well, good-bye
Although, I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

(instrumental & alto sax solo)

You made me cry
When you said, good-bye
Ain't that a shame?
M tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Oh well, good-bye
Although, I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame.
