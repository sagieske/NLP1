The Youth:

We're living in a f****d up world
Where our leaders don't give a f**k.

Tobacco focussed just on teens,
The alcohol consumes your green.

How the f**k can you sleep at night
When the numbers of Injured are insanely high

Corruption and selfish thoughts control your mind,
The youth just follows you blind!

We're living in a f****d up world
Where our leaders don't give a f**k.

Tobacco focussed just on teens,
The alcohol consumes your green.

How the f**k can you sleep at night
When the numbers of Injured are insanely high

Corruption and selfish thoughts control your mind,
The youth just follows you blind!

You can't control me!
