Song:

I know a man from Galilee
If you're in sin He'll set you free
Oh, do you know Him

Son of David, seed of Abraham
Stone hued out of the mountain
He's a meek and humble Lamb
Oh, do you know Him

Billows roll breakers dash
I don't sway He holds me fast
Dark clouds dim the sky
But that's alright
Jesus is nigh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Do you know Him
Do you know Jesus
Do you know Him
Do you know Jesus

Do, do you know
Do you
Do you know Jesus

Know the Man who set me free from sin, Jesus

Know the Man who was born in Bethlehem, Jesus

I wanna know

Do, do you know
Do you
Do you know Jesus
