Song:

Crumpled sheets of paper
With written songs for you
My hands shiver, this heart beating
This love might be true.
So close, yet so distant
I don't know why never have I imagined, 
I'd fall for you.

Let the dawn gather all our doubts
That would infect this perfect heart
For no reason than I'm here
I know of nothing more complete.

Each day, my love grows deeper
Deeper like never before
Love is not easy but I'm holding on to this
So don't give up
And fill my heart
Nothing else matters, 
But you and me.

We're drifting apart
My only greatest fear
I thought I could live without you
Shouldn't drown in tears.
To you my all I surrender
I've been waiting patiently
You'd never leave, 
You promised be my man, 
I love you freely.

Each day, my love grows deeper
Deeper like never before
Love is not easy but I'm holding on to this
So don't give up
And fill my heart
Nothing else matters, 
But you and me.

Without a doubt you hold my heart
Close your eyes and feel my love
Take a breath, hold it dreaming
My heart is yours I'll be waiting

Each day, my love grows deeper
Deeper like never before
Love is not easy but I'm holding on to this
So don't give up
And fill my heart
Nothing else matters, 
But you and me.
