Song:

I grew up with a lot of green
Nice things round me, I was safe, I was fine
Grew up with a lot of dreams
Plans who to be
None of them that were mine
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And me

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****

I can be the perfect one, but I make you come
And I'm locked in your mind
You can say I don't belong
That I'm so wrong
I can tell, tell you lie

I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
I love freaks, I don't care if you're a wild one
And me

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****

Rough around the edges, memories and baggage
You know me
Never play a safe card, when I go, I go hard
And now you know

I, I'm not the prettiest you've ever seen
But I have my moments, I have my moments
Not the flawless one I've never been
But I have my moments, I have my moments
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****
I can get a little drunk, I get into all the don't's
But on good days I am charming as ****
