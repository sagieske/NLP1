Song:

The sun is out, the sky is blue, there's not a cloud to spoil the view but it's raining, raining in my heart
The weather man says clear today, he doesn't know you've gone away and it's raining, raining in my heart
Oh, misery, misery, what's gonna become of me?
I tell my blues they mustn't show but soon these tears are bound to flow, 'cause it's raining, raining in my heart

But it's raining, raining in my heart

And it's raining, raining in my heart
Oh, misery, misery, what's gonna become of me?
I tell my blues they mustn't show but soon these tears are bound to flow, 'cause it's raining, raining in my heart
Raining in my heart, raining in my heart
