Song:

We tell ourselves another season
We turn away and find the reason
We close our eyes to what we see
But love is stronger far than we

When we are close, the world is singin'
And when we touch, the moonlight is wingin'
And there's no way to disagree
For love is stronger far than we

When hearts are meant for caring,
And lives are meant for sharing,
Then we are joined by destiny
For love is stronger far than we

So we may say another season
May say goodbye and find the reason
But love decides how things must be
For love is stronger far than we

When hearts are meant for caring,
And lives are meant for sharing,
Then we are joined by destiny
For love is stronger far than we

So we may say another season
May say goodbye and find the reason
But love decides how things must be
For love is stronger far than we

So we may say another season
May say goodbye and find the reason
But love decides how things must be
For love is stronger far than we
Ha haa, ha haa
