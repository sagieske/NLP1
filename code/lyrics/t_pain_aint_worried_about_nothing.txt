[Hook:]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse:]
Pain, I be putting in work
I'mma never let them beat me
Got a couple b*****s in the club with me
I pop with em, gonna get freaky
I ain't got no problem spendin all of my money
N****s already know what I do
But in case you forgot some
I'mma hit you in the face with it kinda like I drop some
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Hook:]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse:]
N****s all want my share
Lamborghinis all in my yard
I gotta protect myself
N***a I've been workin too hard
So that gun rack got that sk
And that ak and I love everyone of them chicks
But I got too many goons so I ain't gotta shoot none of them s***s
People keep sayin I'm broke
Like I ain't connected to s**t
I got checks coming in,
I can stay at home in the bed stretchin and s**t
Put the game on rock, somebody invest in this kid
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Hook:]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

[Verse:]
Still getting texts from n****s out
Still getting checks from kiss kiss
Still getting checks from them
And while you pour drink I still make yo flip
Still getting checks from Budweiser
Still getting checks from Wallmart
He got that auto tune mic, he just doin what he ought to do
Right? Knock it out that ball park
Man I'm still all up in music dog
You ain't gotta worry bout me
I'm better, better than ever
N***a you can ask Tyrese
F**k yo swag, I put on that top hat
N****s said I dressed like a kid
But how many n****s you know that can dress like that and still do all that s**t I did?
Got your girl twerking on Twitter
I'm still in love with that stripper
So all three of us are gunna hit the bar
Then go holla at the bartender
Y'all keep on hatin' on me
You know I don't give a f**k
‘Cause when I step up in the building…(I ain't got to say it)
I ain't worried about nothing

[Hook:]
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
N***a, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
