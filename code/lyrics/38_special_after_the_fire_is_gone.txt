Song:

You never know what the moment means till it's finally gone
You burned so fast, you put out the flame, tell me, what went wrong?
How do you get back to the heat of yesterday?
How do you live feelin' like you're dying more each day?
After the Fire Is Gone
After the Fire is Gone

You had the whole world at your feet and you stood so tall
You played the game one too many times, now you've lost it all
What got you started now is a million miles away
You wake up only to find that you're a little bit too late
After the Fire is Gone
After the Fire is Gone

[Bridge:]
World keeps turnin', life keeps burnin'
After the Fire is Gone
World keeps rollin' on and on and on and on and on.....
After the Fire is Gone

It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone.....
After the Fire is Gone.

(Repeat)
