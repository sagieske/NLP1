[Lil Chuckee]
Nothing make a man feel better than his lady
Cause girl I got you

[Chorus:]
I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'ma buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa...
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)

[Lil Twist]
As I was walking by
I seen you standing there with a smile
Lookin shy caught my eye
Thought you wanna hang a while
I15 on the beat and I ain't cruisin highways
So baby let's get away
Save the troubles for another day haa...
Jammin Escapade in the lot
Wit Escalade on the back
Ya homies wack I promise that
It ain't trickin if you got it
Might as well spend a stack
I hit the mall and ball down
Call me young Steven Jackson
And I'm the one
And I won with no games played
Never have to work in our life day we got it made
Every day's a vacae M. I. Ami like Dade
And we ain't ever clean up
Cause baby I got maids haa...
Young money we so paid
And if you ever get hurt baby I'm ya band-aid ha...
While I'm lookin at you
Never worry bout nothing cause girl I got you

[Lil Chuckee]
I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'ma buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa...
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cuz girl I got you)

[Lil Chuckee]
Shawty I'm here any time that you need me
Fa sheezy I'm here to make ya life... Easy
They say to every good dude there's a good lady
And I have mine already
Ain't no need to keep lookin
And when I'm on the road you go to my house
And walk my bulldog and help my mums out
And play with my sister you know I love that
That's why whatever you want I'ma cop that
I'm your Rashaad, you my Nu-Nu
I'm ya Will Smith, baby you my Jada Pooh
And when I'm in the studio you come chill wit me
Play around with my hair
You keep me motivated
If we had a team
I'd be Reggie Bush you'd be Kim Kardashian
Your body so amazing
And when I'm not witcha
I'm on my ipod Bumpin 'Forever My Lady' I love ya

[Lil Chuckee]
I know I'm always gone and I'm hardly never home Don't worry bout nothing (baby girl I got you)
When I touch back down I'ma buy you everything
You ain't gotta work for nothing (cause girl I got you)
Don't worry what your friends say
Cause they be hatin anyway
They mad when I tell ya (baby girl I got you) haa...
It's just me and you against the world
Baby girl I know you got my back (cause girl I got you)
