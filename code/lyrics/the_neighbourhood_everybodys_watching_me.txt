Song:

I told you I would tell you, everything you want to know
You want me to tell you now.
You question me to shout it, need to hear about it
Think that I would count you out

I let you find it on your own, then I found myself alone

Uh oh where can I go everybody's watching me x2
Ooh ooh what can I do, if you're not here to tell you
Uh oh where can I go, everybody's watching me

I go through all the trouble keeping it in within my walls
Try to be as subtle as I can
Soon enough it eats me
All I've done defeats me
Looks like you were right again, and again

I let you find it on your own, then I found myself alone

Uh oh where can I go, everybody's watching me x2
Ooh ooh what can I do, if you're not here to tell you
Uh oh where can I go, everybody's watching me

The more I want in, the more I want in
The less I know, the less I know
But I've forgotten, yeah I've forgotten
Ill be alone, ill be alone
Be alone, with everybody watching me

Uh oh where can I go, everybody's watching me x2
Ooh ooh what can I do if you're not here to tell you
Uh oh where can I go if everybody's watching me
