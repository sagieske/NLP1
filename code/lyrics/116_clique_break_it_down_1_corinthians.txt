[Verse 1:]
Yea let me let me tell you bout my homeboy Corey
This the first verse of the very first story
Call it the first letter you can call it what eva
Long as you hear the truth and laeve surely neva
Corey's a new believer actin like he's in a gang(in a gang)
Runnin round sayin his church is the greatest thang(yea)
Won't check a sermon unless it's his bishops name
It seem he forgot to keep Jesus the main thang
Cause bishop ain't raise up after three days
Uhh he ain't take a case up offerin you his grace
Uhh but stay divided all of the time
Not Christ but a man that he's standin behind

[Hook:]
I got this little letter
I'm tryin to break it down(break it down)
So you can hear the truth in the sound(in the sound)
Division a whole lot of sin I can't forget the problem
Of people livin within [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I got this little letter I'm tryin to break it down(break it down)
But let me tell you corey backround
He started off crazy party's full of shawtys
Religious ceremonies where people was gettin naughty
But all that changed the truth of God reign
The Gospel spread within em like viruses in his veins
But mayne even though his heart rearranged
He found himself caught up in some of his old ways
He layin up with women and sinnin was gettin strange
Thought the more he sinned the more Jesus was pleased to saved
He thought cause he accepted his brother touching his mother
That he was spiritual cause he let em get with each other
And corey had beef with another in the face instead of workin through it
Then opened a court case a slap to the face in the God who gives grace
Now corey's outta place tryin to carry his own weight

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Now corey got married but everywhere he turned he sees lust burn
And women waitin to serve em yea and corey's learned
That Satan wishes to turn em away from his wife to satisfy all his yearnins, Divorce ain't legitimate these folk are a generit
But God put together let nobody put a spit in it
See that ain't the end of it he sought his own benefit
He would do the things that his friends saw as the bit in it
Dog you ain't no sin in it his homies they were ignorant they were made weak Cause his liberty was the hinderence unlike an apostle
No concern for the gospel no denying his rights
Now homie wasn't that thoughtful (thoughtful)
