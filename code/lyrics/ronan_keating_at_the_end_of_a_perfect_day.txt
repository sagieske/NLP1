Song:

It's all in a perfect way
Just a part of the perfect way
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down
At the end of a perfect day

I wake to greet another morning
And feel the cold beneath my feet
I rise to hear my future calling
It's calling to me

I watch the people through my window
Then turn the radio up loud
And then I sit and watch the sun go
And I know as the rain's coming down

It's all in a perfect way
Just a part of the perfect way
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down
At the end of a perfect day

Everybody needs some highs and lows
I guess we're lucky to be here
And I don't care which way the wind blows
Cos I know through the laughter and the tears

It's all in a perfect way
Just a part of the perfect way
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down
At the end of a perfect day

Just a part of the perfect way
And as long as the world goes around
I will pray as I lay me down
At the end of a perfect
At the end of a perfect
At the end of a perfect day
