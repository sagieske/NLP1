Song:

Now lay me down on market street
I'm lookin for some spare change
A coast guard ship has been lookin for me
And I might have to change my name
Here comes uncle sam again with the same old bag of beans
The local chiefs on the radio
Hes got some hungry mouths to feed
Goin back to alcatraz

Lay me back down here on the highway
One hundred and one ways to go
Solitary is so confinin
To the legend of geronimo
Oh I know I could bring the rain
Used to dance for abc
And all the braves down on death row
Are pretending to be free
Back home in alcatraz

In the land of the great white father
My american blood runs cold
I left my home in oklahoma
To the everglades I go
Its just the wings on the silver cars
And I'm allowed to plow a field
Its not the life for a nineteen seventy
(what's an)indian boy to do
Goin back to alcatraz
Lay me down on market street
I'm lookin for some spare change
A coast guard ship has been lookin for me
Might have to change my name
Here comes uncle sam again with the same old bag of beans
Local chiefs on the radio
Hes got some hungry mouths to feed
Goin back to alcatraz
Here comes uncle sam again with the same old bag of beans
Local chiefs on the radio
Hes got some hungry mouths to feed
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
Goin back to alcatraz
