Song:

Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

*Chorus*
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's so brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
two to two we need no words at all

Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

*Chorus*
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's so brand new, you'll feel it in my kiss (2x)
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know its true
I never wanted anyone like this its so brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you

When you know it's true you know im crazy for you
And its so brand new, you know im crazy for you
When you know its true, I'm crazy crazy for you oohh
I'm crazy for you!
