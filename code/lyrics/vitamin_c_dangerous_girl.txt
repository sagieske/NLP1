Song:

How can I say goodbye?
When you saw underneath my skin?
Please be mine, all the time
I would halfway around the world
I used to be daddy's little girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

Your baggy jeans, you conquer me
You got my name tattooed on your thigh
So hardcore, I'm down for more
You touch me and left me in this world
You turned me back to daddy's little girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

You are my eye candy
You are my fat daddy
Yeah you are the only one who makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl

Like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

I was just on the plane
Next to you just to landing
Your? Car with the face turned to brown?
Cruising at speeds that the law would never allow

I know all you see is a innocent girl
Around you I'm free like a bird who has just left the ground
In a [?]

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl

You are my eye candy
You are my fat daddy
Yeah you are the only one who makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl

You were my hip-hopper
You were my heart-stopper
Yeah you're the only one that makes me feel
You make me feel like a dangerous girl
Like a dangerous girl
