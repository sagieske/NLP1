Song:

I've been down - I've been beat
I've been so tired - that I could not speak
I've been so lost that I could not see
I wanted things that were out of reach
Then I found you and you helped me through
Yeah you showed me what to do
And that's why I'm comin' back to you... Yeah

Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
That's how your love will take me home back to you
And if I wish upon that star - someday I'll be where you are
I know that day is coming soon - yeah, I'm coming back to you.

You've been alone, but ya did not show it
You've been in pain, but I did not know it
Let me do what I needed to - you were there when I needed you
Mighta let you down, mighta messed you round
But ya never changed your point of view
And that's why I'm comin' back to you... Yeah

Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
That's how your love will take me home back to you
And if I wish upon that star - someday I'll be where you are
I know that day is coming soon - yeah, I'm coming back to you.

Mighta let you down, mighta messed you round
But ya never changed your point of view
And that's why I'm comin' back to you... Yeah

Like a star that guides a ship across the ocean
That's how your love will take me home back to you
And if I wish upon that star - someday I'll be where you are
And I know that day is coming soon - oooh, I'm coming back to you.

I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
I'm coming back to you
That day is coming soon

I'm coming back to you....... Yeah
