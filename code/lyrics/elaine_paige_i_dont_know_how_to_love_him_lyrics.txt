Song:

I Don't Know How To Love Him
I don't know how to love him
What to do how to move him
I've been changed yes really changed
In these past few days
When I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways, he's just one more
Should I bring him down?
Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought it would come to this
What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position?
I'm the one who's always been
So calm so cool no lovers fool
Running every show
He scares me so
Yet if he said he loved me
I'd be lost I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him so
