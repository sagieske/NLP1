Song:

When the morning came, I was up before first light
And your bed was made, you must'a cut out sometime last night
My heart beat started pounding out riddle in my brain
Voice from deep inside said "you've got to be insane"
Everyone knows how this old story goes
So, I got in that taxi... Drank my conscience away

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up
Must be the good life

I went to your friends house, begged you to open the door
With your hands on your hips, you spoke while I sat down on that floor
Two dishes in the kitchen sink, the way you treat me when you drink
Don't look so superior when you give your opinion
Don't think I don't know how you act on your own
And just who are those names on your cell phone anyway?

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up
Must be the good life,

You're a cool breeze in the setting sun
New Year's, the 4th, wrapped into one
You make me want to be someone that you could look up to

If you're gonna be there, be there
If you're gonna stay, stay tonight
Start livin, out with the old, I'm on the up
Must be the good life

Come on get love
Come on and try
Come on now, what are you waiting for?
(Repeat 4x)

When the morning came, I was up before first light
