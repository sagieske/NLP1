Song:

Am I the kind of man
That lives by his heart
Who believes in God almighty
Not fearin' the devil or the dark
Always there when you need me to be
Hold your hand, say I love you
In those hours of need
Wish you could close your eyes
Truthfully one day say them things to me

Am I the kind of man
That thinks he's strong
To stand up in a crowd
And admit when he's wrong
When you're in trouble
To no one else you'll ever plead
Knock on my door, say honey
You're the man I needed to see
Wish you could close your eyes
Truthfully one day say them things to me

I know I ain't been much
But I'm tryin'
Things have been rough lately
I'm not denyin'
But I'm gonna try somehow
To be a better man
'Cause my heart and soul
Is tryin' as hard as it can

Am I the kind of man
Who believes in peace
Who'll stand up and fight in a minute
Over something that he believes
Loves all his brothers
Treats his elders with respect
Never heard me say that I don't give a damn
What the hell, who gives a heck

Wish you could close your eyes
Truthfully one day say them things to me
'Cause you're the only woman alive
That can make that kind of man out of me
