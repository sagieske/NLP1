Song:

I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you.

[Verse]
I'd be lost like a ship at sea that took a wrong turn in the dark
Could put a pen to the story of my life but never know where to start
I'd be skipping days and slipping through the nights without feeling a thing
If you weren't here putting me right what would my life mean.

[Chorus:]
I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you,
Caught in a fire so hot without the rain to make it stop,
They would paint me a fool in a world so cruel, would be hell to go through without an angel like you.

[Verse]
All I need is a shot of your smile to chase the blues away
And anybody else woulda give it up your the kind of love that stays
All of that time I was looking for you I knew there had to be a plan
And I get everything I everything I ever wanted in life when you tell me I'm a good man

[Chorus:]
I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you,
Caught in a fire so hot without the rain to make it stop,
They would paint me a fool in a world so cruel, would be hell to go through without an angel like you.

[Chorus:]
I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you,
Caught in a fire so hot without the rain to make it stop,
They would paint me a fool in a world so cruel, would be hell to go through without an angel like you.

I don't know what on earth I'd do without an angel like you.
