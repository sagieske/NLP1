Song:

Burn up the interstate
Got somewhere you need to be, you're
Not gonna let nobody slow you down
Turn off the radio and
Turn up your telephone
You don't have the time to smell the roses now

But take a second maybe
Before it gets too loud
Breathe before your breath runs out

[Chorus:]
Don't try so hard
To move past the moment
These days go by
And they're gone before you know it
So come on, open your window
Let the light shine in
This is life don't miss it

What if you took the time
To really soak it in
'Cause someday you're gonna wish you did
Like a September morning
Like snow without a warning
Like how the summer feels upon your skin

Take a minute maybe
Before the sun goes down
Breathe before your breath runs out

[Chorus:]
Don't try so hard
To move past the moment
These days go by
And they're gone before you know it
So come on, open your window
Let the light shine in
This is life don't miss it

Just take a second maybe
Before the sun goes down
Breathe before your breath runs out

[Chorus:]
Don't try so hard
To move past the moment
These days go by
And they're gone before you know it
So come on, open your window
Let the light shine in
This is life don't miss it
