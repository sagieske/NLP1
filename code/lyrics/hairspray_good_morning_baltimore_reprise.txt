Song:

Tracy
Oh, oh, oh
I'm all alone
My heart has grown
But it's broken, too

This morning
Life was a Baltimore fairy tale
Now I can't make bail!

My mother's in shock
My father's in hock
I much prefer link's arms
To jailhouse cells

So link, please rescue me now
'Cause I love you
And this prison smells.
Link, hear the bells!

And get ready, Baltimore
There's a bright, brand-new
Day in store
Let me out so this dream's
Unfurled
I'll eat some breakfast,
Then change the world!
And I promise Baltimore
Once I cha-cha right out of
That door
The world's gonna wake up
And see
Link's in love with me!
