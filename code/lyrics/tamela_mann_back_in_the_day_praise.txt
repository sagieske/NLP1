Song:

Is there anybody out there remember (remember)
How we used to go to the midnight musical.
We would praise his name in song all night long.
Oh the old tent revival singing wade in the water as the praise goes higher

Chorus
I want to give Him a back in the day praise, oooooh
I want to give Him a back in the day praise, can you help me sing
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
The kind of crazy praise I live for,
It's the kind of praise this thing was built on.

Don't you remember, the conventions all the praying and preaching and allnight shut-ins. The Holy Ghost road in when the doors of the church were open. When pleasing god was pleasing you. Church was all we knew. Oooh,

Chorus
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
Don't you remember back in the day
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
The kind of praise we used to give
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
When we get down on our knees and pray,
The kind of crazy praise I live for,
It's the kind of praise this thing was built on.

Do you remember, when we used to have prison night, don't you'll remember, When we used to have singing like this, wade in the water,
What a friend we have in Jesus, I'll fly away o glory, precious lord take my hand, lord lift me up cause I want to go higher

Chorus
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
The way that we used to praise him
I want to give Him a back in the day praise, ooooooohhhhh

The kind of crazy praise I live for, (take me back)
It's the kind of praise this thing was built on.

Chorus

I'm gonna praise him, I'm gonna praise him,
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
I want to give Him a back in the day praise
Praise, paise, clap your hands, stomp your feet,

I want to give Him a back in the day praise,
Ooooooohhhhh He's worthy, he's worthy, to be praised

The kind of crazy praise I live for, it's the kind of praise this thing was built on.
