Song:

[Verse:]
It won't be in vain
To swallow all your pain
And learn to love what burns
And gather courage to return

[Hook x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 2:]
The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain

[Hook x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 3:]
They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient

[Hook x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
