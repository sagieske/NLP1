Song:

I'm comin' home, baby now
I'm comin' home now, right away
I'm comin' home, baby now
I'm sorry now I ever went away
Every night and day, I'm gone stay

I'm comin' home, baby
(Come on home)
Comin' home baby, now
(You know I'm waitin' here for you)
I'm comin' home now, real soon
(You've been gone)

Comin' home baby, now
(You don't know what I'm goin' through)

I'm comin' home I know I'm overdue
(Since you went away)
Expect me any day, now real soon

I'm comin' home
(Come on home)
Comin' home baby, now
(You know I'm prayin' every night)
And everything is gonna be fine
(Please come home)

Comin' home baby, now
(I want to feel you hold me tight)
Expect to see me now, anytime
