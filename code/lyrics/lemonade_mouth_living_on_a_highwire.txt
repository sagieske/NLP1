Song:

[Verse:]
This is the story on how we lived
The glory of what we did
It started when we were kids
When music was up in our heads
She said
I've been out on the edge
Breathing a little bit of fresh air
Big dreams
I took a chance
Held out for everything I've got here
I've been feeling this life's a circus
Hanging on without a fear

[Chorus:]
Living on a high wire
Running through a wildfire
You can't shake me
I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net
High hopes
Step back
I'm gonna make it over

Na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire
Na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire

[Verse 2:]
This is the story on how we lived
The glory of what we did
It started when we were kids
When music was up in our heads
She said
Big top turning around
No clowns
I'm running as I hit the ground
Front row
Big show is sold out
So I'm ready for the crowd roar
Lets go
I've been feeling this life's a circus
Hanging on without fear
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Living on a high wire
Running through a wildfire
You can't shake me
I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net
High hopes
Step back
I'm gonna make it over

Na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire
Na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire

[Bridge:]
When it comes to the beat
Seeing that the hands are moving
Move off your seat
Achievements what we're really doing
Freedom of speech
I'm in it just to win it
I'm springing it
I can see it
In the end that you can be it
'Cause it's patience
It's statements
Famous greatness
Moving till you make it through
And baby you can make it too

[Chorus:]
Living on a high wire
Running through a wildfire
You can't shake me
I'm not going nowhere
Walking on a tight rope
No net
High hopes
Step back
I'm gonna make it over

Na na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire
Na na na na na na na na na
Living on a high wire
