Song:

Do you know why Im here?
I cant take it anymore.
Ive got a blanket for two,
All we need is the moon.

Be careful and hold my hand,
You can put your trust in me.
I never want this to end,
So kiss me once again.

Come with me,
Far away.
Well let the stars,
Guide our way.

The grass seems greener,
Since you came along.
And I cant get you out of my head,
Youve been there all day long.

Come with me,
Far away.
Well let the stars,
Guide our way
