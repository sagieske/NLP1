Brock -)
We're angels of life, we're angels of death
We're born to blaze a nuclear way through space
A way out of the waste that held the human race
We're angels of life, we're angels of death
We are the dead who are never led
We are the warriors at the edge of time
We lurk inside your brain, hide inside your minds
We're angels of life, we're angels of death
We stalk the city streets to kill all we meet
Nostrils flare awhile, it makes you want to smile
We're born to erase, all of your days
