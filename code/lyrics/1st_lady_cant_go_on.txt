Song:

I can't go on living without you
I can't go on without seeing you smiling baby
I can't go on living without you
I can't go on without holding you in my arms

Sometimes people make mistakes in their lives..
But why do we have to end things this way..
I guess I'm trying to say..
That I really miss your loving..
And I really miss your hugging..
Everything.. Everything.. Everyday..
I sit awake every night..
Wondering if I'll ever find..
Mr. Right..
I know that we fight..
But then I try to see my self..
With someone else..
But I always see myself..
Running back to you.. Baby..

Can't go on living with out you..
All the times I said that I doubt you..
Be there.. I swear..
And you mean everything..
You mean everything..
To me when your close to me..
I get chills cause it feels so real..
I can't resist boy I need your kiss..
I just can't go on like this..

I'm trying to fight my fears..
Holding back after all these years..
I'll lose myself..
And walk away from me again..
Cause I give you my heart..
And not just a piece of it..
I love you form the very start..
And my love will never go away..
I miss you everyday..
Your gone..
Since you went away..
I been lost..
And when my phone rings..
I hope it's your call..
But I'll jus keep wishing...
Things that just don't come true..
And all it does is make me sad.. It don't help..
And then I end up getting mad.. Myself..
Tell me baby.. Why you wanna make me feel like that..

Can't go on living with out you..
All the times I said that I doubt you..
Be there.. I swear..
And you mean everything..
You mean everything..
To me when your close to me..
I get chills cause it feels so real..
I can't resist boy I need your kiss..
I just can't go on like this..

After all the times that passed..
I still want you in my life..
You were my first love..
And I want you to be my last..
I still remember..
All of those mornings..
We lay in bed together and laughed..
I wish that would last forever..
But until you come back to me..
All I have are old memoriies..
Days of you and me..
Wishing you'd just come back to me..
Come everysecond your gone..
And I'm sitting alone everynite..
Writing these two love songs..
Baby come back to me..

I know that things have changed..
And I know your in a different state now..
I'm willing to change to see.. My place..
You're the only man I've ever loved..
Before you, I never knew love..
How can you walk away and never look back..
Never look back..

Can't go on living with out you..
All the times I said that I doubt you..
Be there.. I swear..
And you mean everything..
You mean everything..
To me when your close to me..
I get chills cause it feels so real..
I can't resist boy I need your kiss..
I just can't go on like this..

I can't go on living without you
I can't go on without seeing you smiling..
I can't go on living without you
I can't go on without seeing you smiling baby..

Can go on living with out..
All the times I said that I doubt you..
Be there.. I swear..
And you mean everything..
You mean everything
To me when your close to me..
I get chills cause it feels so real..
I can't resist boy I need your kiss..
I just can go on like this..
