Song:

You - with your brown eyes - deep like a deep Forest in motion
Your hair - golden as the sunrise in the east

(I) take a look at your neck - charming and clear like the snow
Your breasts are looking like the crown of (all) creation

Sensitive as the skin of a babyto taste them is sweeter then the sweetest honey

Ref.:
My sweet blonde
You're taking my breath
You're above my head
You're the best I've ever had
I'm head over heals in Love - My sweet blonde

2ndFirst time our eyes met - I've known it from the start
First time we touched - I thought I was in Heaven

It happened during the game of all games
My hands are trembling if I only think of

When our lips felt each other - I was so sure -
I wanna hold you to the rest of my life

Ref.:
My sweet blonde
You're taking my breath
You're above my head
You're the best I've ever had
I'm head over heals in Love -My sweet blonde

Solo

Zwischenteil:

Babe - I'll walk the wire for you
There's nothing like the run of the mill

I wanna touch you -
Kiss you -
Hold you -
Feel you -

Ref.:
My sweet blonde
You're taking my breath
You're above my head
You're the best I've ever had
I'm head over heals in Love - My sweet blonde

Ref.:
My sweet blonde
You're taking my breath
You're above my head
You're the best I've ever had
I'm head over heals in Love - My sweet blonde
