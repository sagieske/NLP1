Song:

Oh, oh, hey, oh ooh, ooh
Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Ooh oh, baby
Are you listening?
Oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

Baby, can ya hear me when I'm crying out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me I feel like I'm standing with an army
A man armed with weapons
Hey, oh

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me were meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing when he led me to you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
When you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
