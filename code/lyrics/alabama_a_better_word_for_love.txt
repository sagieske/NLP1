Song:

A Better Word For Love
(Al Anderson / Gary Nicholson)

Here's another morning
Soon she'll be waking up
I watched her and wonder
If there's a better word for love

So many times I've told her
It never seems enough
So I keep searching
For a better word for love

Moaning, stumbling, wondering
When I find a way
'Cos I know she knows
There's nothing more to say

Tonight when I'm out walking
I'll asked the stars above
If out there somewhere
There's a better word for love

Moaning, stumbling, wondering
When I find a way
'Cos I know she knows
There's nothing more to say

So here's another morning
Soon she'll be waking up
I guess I'll just hold her tight
'Til there's a better word for love
I guess I'll just hold her tight
'Til there's a better word for love
