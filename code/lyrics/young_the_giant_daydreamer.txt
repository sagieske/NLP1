Song:

It's a full moon at midnight
Running fast out of time
It's a feeling you can't describe
Floating past the pale skylight

And you look reflective
But you're so disconnected
Just think about it
What's really on your mind

For you I would steal time
Suspicion, suspicion 

You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of the life
You'll forget, you'll forget

It's so affected
That color corrected night
But you're falling fast
Through plastic skies
And you look reflective
So disconnected

It's not real life
Open your eyes and breathe
Everything's in it's right place
When nothing go can stay
Just tell me you know my face

You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of the life
You'll forget, you'll forget

When the moon was high
You couldn't describe
A lucid sky
We just might die
But we feel so alive

You're a daydreamer, oh
And it's the same thing over and over
We're running for our lives
In a slipstream, oh
You'll wake up someday
And realize
You were dreaming of the life
You'll forget
