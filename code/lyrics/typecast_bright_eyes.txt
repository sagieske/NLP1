Song:

I know that you can't hear
My mind is screaming your name
Your smiles that crushes my chest with the waves of
With the waves my dreams
I curse myself for looking your way
With the waves of
With the waves my dreams
I curse myself for looking your way
I can never tell if our eyes are meeting
My heart is racing, what are we avoiding
I must be dreaming
I can never tell
Lying face to face
Your bright eyes cradles me and I'm
Wishing you're here when I wake up
Is this too much to ask? Or is this enough
If this is a dream then I don't want to wake up
