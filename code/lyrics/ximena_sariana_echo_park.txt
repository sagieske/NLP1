Song:

I am bent on a craving
Time to change out of date and
There is always someone else
In the making

I will go if you let me
For the ones who'll impress me
I can fail in and out of love very quickly.

I though he was ready
To mend my broken heart
I fell when he told me
He liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive, 
Give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
Knows his way 'round casually.
Till someone remind me that
He was fond the Godard

I am known to be fooled by
Simple ones covered in lies
The know how yo hypnotize
With their dull eyes.

I though he was ready
To mend my broken heart
I fell when he told me
He liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive, 
Give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
Knows his way 'round casually.
Till someone remind me that
He knew about modern art.

I though he was ready
To mend my broken heart
I fell when he told me
He liked to play guitar
I know I can be naive, 
Give myself entirely
For a man who looks like he
Knows his way 'round casually.
Till someone remind me that
He lived in Echo Park
