Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work, work, work, work,
Work, work, work, work

Diamonds all in my brain, n-gga
Gold watches, gold chain, n-gga
Hundred dollar champagne, n-gga
Yeah, my money insane n-gga
Yeah, I'm making it rain n-gga
But I was just on a plane, n-gga
Buying gear, flying here
F-ck The Smurfs, it's my time of year
Uh, if I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up, so I get love from that
The n-gga stole my swag, but I don't want it back, my n-gga
I was on this, but now I'm on to that
You see them in my closet, for a song to write
Was in duran white, now I'm going back my n-gga
I got so much money I should start bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to take
Pop so many bottles, it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still growing up, and my family here
And they rolling up, so I'm

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work, work, work, work,
Work, work, work, work

Have your pretty a** up in this f-ck-ng car
B-tch I'm not this broke, or you know I'm a star
Used to barrels, but now we're by the bar
Last year they had to ask, now they know who we are
Bullsh-t, walk in the building, I own sh-t
You tell by who I'm on the phone with
And n-gga talk about grown sh-t
N-gga too busy jacking my swag
Need to f-ck around, get your own sh-t
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own b-tch
You ain't ripping my game, get your own click

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

Go hard, make sure you do it everyday
It's what you gotta do
That's your job
And n-gga's gone hate, but that's no prob
So hey, f-ck 'em, don't need nothing from 'em
So n-ggas talking, but the sh-t they claiming
Don't mean nothing
Straight from cali, that's what's in my joint
That's what I'm puffin, og
And been one since I was young
Enough to now the airy vibe was gonna know me
Most n-gga don't see

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
Cuz my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why where I come from
The only thing we know is

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
