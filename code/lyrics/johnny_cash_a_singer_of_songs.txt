Song:

I'm not a savior, and I'm not a saint.
The man with the answers I certainly aint.
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong.
I'm just a singer of songs.

But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream.
I can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams.
I can help you hear a babys laugh and feel the joy it brings.
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing.
I'm not a prophet, and I'm not a priest.
I'm not a wise man whos come from the East.
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong.
I'm just a singer of songs.

But I can take you to a city where a man was crucified.
I can tell you how He lived, and I can tell you why He died.
I can help proclaim the glory of this mighty king of kings.
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing.
I'm not a great man. I don't claim to be.
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me,
I wont hang my head. Ill stand proud and strong
And say, I was a singer. Lord, I was a singer.
Yes, I was a singer of songs.?
