Song:

Alligators and Acrobats, Antelopes and Alleycats,
Those are words that begin with... The "A" sound!
Animals living in the zoo, the Alphabet, and an Apple too,
Those are words that begin with... The "A" sound!

And if by chance, it happens your name is Alice...
Or Ann, or Albert,
Then you can say...
To everybody

"My name is Alice, Ann, or Al-bert,
And my name begins with the sound of the letter 'a'! "

(conversation with Ant named Ambercrombe)

And if by chance it happens your name is Alice...
Or Ann or Albert,
Than you can say...
To everybody

"My name is Alice, Ann, or Al-bert,
And my name begins with the sound of the letter 'a'! "
The letter "A"
The letter "A!"
