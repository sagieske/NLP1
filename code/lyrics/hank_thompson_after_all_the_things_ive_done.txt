Song:

I know I broke your heart and made you cry
Once again I'm sorry so here am I
Asking for forgiveness one more time
After all the things I've done
Just another chance at loving you
All the little things I never thought to do
Can you just forgive me one more time
After all the things I've done
I've headed down the road of sorrow lured by carefree fun
There's only a dark tomorrow I'll be worth of things I've done
If you can believe me just once more though I have drifted far from shore
I'll try to untangle the web I spun after all the things I've done
I've headed down the road...
