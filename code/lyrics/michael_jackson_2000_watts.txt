Song:

Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I'm real
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal

[Chorus:]
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload

3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when I reach I can go 'til I hit my peak
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me

[Chorus:]

[Ad libs]

[Chorus out]
