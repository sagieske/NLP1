Ooh, Donna, ooh, Donna
Ooh, Donna, ooh, Donna

I had a girl, Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl, Donna
Where can you be?
Where can you be?

Now that you're gone
I'm left all alone
All by myself, to wander and roam
'Cause I love my girl
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

Well, darlin', now that you're gone
I don't know what I'll do
Ooh, 'cause I've had all my love
For-or you-ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-woo-mmm

I had a girl, Donna was her name
Since she left me
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl,
Donna, where can you be?
Where can you be?

Ooh, Donna, ooh, Donna
Ooh, Donna, ooh, Donna

Fades-

Ooh.
