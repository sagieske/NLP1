Song:

Please help this is my mayday
I'm out of reach I got lost on the way
I know what you say is true
I'm going anywhere but here with you
I know that I can be wrong
I always listen to the same sad songs

Please give me the chance to live
Forgetting something I still don't believe
I tried yes I jumped around
I ended up falling on the ground
I know that I can die soon
So use a fork to stick me not a spoon

Just break it out
Just break it out today
I'm gonna pretend that you never went away
Just break it out
Just break it out today
I'm losing my mind

Please help us this is my mayday
I'm out of reach I got lost on the way
I tried yes I jumped around
I ended up falling on the ground
I know that I can be wrong
I always listen to the same sad songs
