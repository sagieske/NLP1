Verse 1
What's wrong with me and what's happening to us'
Tell me am I being replaced, because I fell things are not the same'
Like they use to be, when we use to be in love
And now you wanna stay out all night
Coming home at the break of daylight
Hook
(Who is she) who's taking my place'
(Who is she), you can't even look at my face
(Who is she), she's stealing your heart and tearing my whole world apart
Chorus
I've been with you for so long and now you wanna leave me
I've always been your backbone and now you wanna hurt me
This time I gotta move on, it's time to say goodbye
This time I'm going to be strong, and I'm going to be alright
Verse 2
I know in time that this pain is going to end
But I can't forget about our past and how I tried so hard to make it last
Ooh but until then, my faith just has to be strong
Because my love for you has died and now it's time for my heart to move on
Hook
(Who is she) who's taking my place'
(Who is she), you can't even look at my face
(Who is she), she's stealing your heart and tearing my whole world apart
Chorus
I've been with you for so long and now you wanna leave me
I've always been your backbone and now you wanna hurt me
This time I gotta move on, it's time to say goodbye
This time I'm going to be strong, and I'm going to be alright
