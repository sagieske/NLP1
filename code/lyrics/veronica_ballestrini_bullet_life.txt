Song:

Just when I thought I could be who I am, I am not me
Just when I thought I could play in my world, it's not where I'll be
Everything moves so fast, screaming as it goes past
I woke up one day, and suddenly

I'm standing still, as the world ignites, watching cars and people
Go shooting by my head, the sky is light, and the sky is dark
And the buildings rise and they fall apart again
It's a flash of light, it's a razor knife, when you're holding on
To a bullet life

I guess that I thought I would have more time to look through my dreams
Maybe I don't have to grow up right now, but that's how it feels
The way that life's speeding by, if I looked at my arms I'd fly
Somebody tell me what this means

I'm standing still, as the world ignites, watching cars and people
Go shooting by my head, the sky is light, and the sky is dark
And the buildings rise and they fall apart again
It's a flash of light, it's a razor knife, when you're holding on
To a bullet life

Everything moves so fast, screaming as it goes past
I woke up one day, and suddenly, 

I'm standing still, as the world ignites, watching cars and people
Go shooting by my head, the sky is light, and the sky is dark
And the building rise and they fall apart again
It's a flash of light, it's a razor knife, when you're holding on
To a bullet life
