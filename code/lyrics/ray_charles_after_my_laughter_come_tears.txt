Song:

1) I laughed the day I saw you leave, I laughed and
said Id never grieve
but now after my laughter came tears (after my
laughter came tears)
2) I told my friends, I didn't care, I laughed about
a whole affair
but say now after my laughter came tears
* my cryin helped me from showin them that I was blue
(listen)
by myself youÁ£çl never know what I've been through (
just what I'm goin through)
3) my lips conceal a hurtin pain, I make believe but
all in vain
I said now after
my.....................................
(solo piano)
* repeat
3) repeat
