Tell me your secret
I don't wanna know about just any secret
I wanna know about that special secret {Oh}
Because tonight I want you to learn all about the
Secrets
In your garden

I wanna read your mind, know you deepest feelings
I wanna make it right for you
Baby, show me
Let me share the mystery, oh
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Listen to your heart tonight
(Come on, come on, come on)
Make it alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on, come out tonight)

I know a melody that we could sing together
I've got the secret key to you, baby
Let's make music
Harmonizin' ecstasy
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, sing it to me

Here in the garden
Where temptation feels so right
Passion can make you fall for what you feel
In the garden {Ooh... }
We can make it come alive { We can make it come
Alive}
Every night, oh, woman {Every single night}
Your secret garden, hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... 

Oh, baby
I need to be with you, let me lay beside you
Do what you want me too all night
Gonna hold you
Ooh, baby, can I touch you there
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I can keep you satisfied, baby
(Come on, come on, come on)
Ooh, ooh-wee, ooh-wee, baby
Please, baby, oh, darlin'
(Come on, come out tonight)

Yeah, baby
I'll take good care of you
That's what a man is supposed to do
And I'll be there for you all the time
Let you hair down
Let me get you in the mood
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
Come on, take me, take me with you

Into the garden
Where temptation feels so right
Passion can make you fall for what you feel
In the garden
We can make it come alive
Every night, oh, woman
Here in the secret garden, hoo... hoo... hoo... hoo... 

And I never wanted anyone
(Woo... ooh... ooh... woo...)
I never wanted anyone as much as I, as much as I want
You
I want you to show me, I want you to tell me how you
Feel
(Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, baby) All the secrets

If you think I am gonna take care of you
If you think I have got what you need
Sho' you right [And I want to take our time because
We
Have all night]
If you think I am gonna be good to you
If you think I like what you do
Sho' you right (Oh, I'm gon' be so good to you, baby, 
Ooh-wee, ooh-wee, baby)

If you think I am gonna take care of you (Hey...)
If you think I have got what you need
Sho' you right [Let me know your secrets]
If you think I am gonna be good to you
If you think I like what you do
Sho' you right [Sho' you right, baby, you don't know
Me]

If you think I am gonna take care of you {Ooh... }
If you think I have got what you need
Sho' you right [How does that feel]
If you think I am gonna be good to you (I'm gonna be
Good to you)
If you think I like what you do (Oh...)
Sho' you right (Oh...)

If you think I am gonna take care of you
If you think I have got what you need
Sho' you right (Turn the lights down low)
If you think I am gonna be good to you
