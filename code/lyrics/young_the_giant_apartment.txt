Song:

After leaving my apartment
I feel this cold inside me
It howls all through the market
It calls your name

On my way to your apartment
I write for fear of silence
You carved a boat to sell my shadow
Now I walk alone

I hit the sidewalk and this is how it starts
Hide in a raincoat when things are falling apart

After leaving your apartment
I hear the coast by nightfall
So sure to keep you dreaming
You understood
Oh, I know you understood
Yes sir, it shows I was no good

I hit the sidewalk and this is how it starts
Hide in a raincoat when things are falling apart
Cause sooner or later this is bound to stop
Come on, let's savor what we're falling over

After leaving your apartment
I hear the coast...
