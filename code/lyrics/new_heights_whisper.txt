Song:

You and I ignite like all the stars are in between us
And even though I've run into you
In my life I've yet to see

Further than I've ever gone I'm feeling something real
And there's no one else who takes your place
The pull of something real

So I'll fly over endless skies
Fly until the end of time
Because I don't want you to be let down at all you see
I just wanna have you whisper into me

You and I ignite like all the stars are in between us
And even though I've run into you
In my life I've yet to see

Further than I've ever gone I'm feeling something real
And there's no one else who takes your place
The pull of something real

So I'll fly over endless skies
Fly until the end of time
Because I don't want you to be let down at all you see
I just wanna have you whisper

Into me
Into me
Into me

I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you
I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you

Because I don't want you to be let down at all you see
I just wanna have you whisper

I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you
I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you

I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you
I'm finding my way, finding my way
Finding my way back to you
