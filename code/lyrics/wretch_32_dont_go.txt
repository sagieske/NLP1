(Ft. Josh Kumra)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Don't go
I don't know where you come from
But you're everywhere I go
I don't know why you chose me, why me
But as long as you're here I don't need to know
So don't' go

Yeah, when I got introduced to you I knew I'd be true to you
Everyone wanted a place you whisper to me that sweet guys like me you love
And I feel it in my soul
It's like you're always with me on the road
Phone in my hand while I listen to you moan
And everybody in the car want to try and get involved
Yeah, then you make a silly tone puppy love now like give a dog a bone
Shut me up how I can breathe when I'm a frown
Our loves concrete we should lead a setting stone
Yeah and whenever I'm in doubt you forever calm me down
And sometimes I'm a dummie and I know would of crashed if you never was around

Chorus:
So don't go
Don't leave
Please stay
With me
You are the only thing I need to get by, get by

Yeah I spend a little change on you
But you always give it back
'Cause I know you ain't here for the money
You just wanna see me be the man
So I earnt my respect like a true gentleman
All the rumors were capital irrelevant
We should get those two emblems
And I give my life to you that's a street settlement
Yeah I feeling ever so emotional
'Cause I never had nothing when approaching you
Sitting with a straight face on a poker man
That's why a song like this has been over due
Due over time, time over
Love drunk you and I would die sober
I'm in this for forever and a day
That's why where ever I go, they've got to put you on a plane

Chorus:
So don't go
Don't leave
Please stay
With me
You are the only thing I need to get by, 
To get by, to get by, to get by.

Uhh... I swear I ain't ever seen a sky so clear
Together we're gon' make history
Why would you wanna be elsewhere?
See I swear, I ain't ever seen a sky so clear
Together we're gon' make history
Why would you wanna be elsewhere?

Don't go leave me now
Don't go leave me
Stay right here till my dark days in to light years I'ma shine yeah
Don't go leave me now
Don't go leave me
Loosing you is one of my fears
But I ain't selfish I share if I have to

[2 x Chorus:]
