Song:

All along the street
They're holding signs that say
That I am lost
And that I do not know the way
I asked the rock
Sitting in a shade of grey
I asked the rock
He didn't have a thing to say

But you are the only light I see
You are the only light I need
When everybody else is sleeping
You come along and help me breathe

When I was a stone
No one knew that I was there
I'd sing my song and
No one ever really cared
I went to the mountain
Face all covered in tears
I wept but
Mountain didn't seem to hear

So you are the only light I see
You are the only light I need
When everybody else is sleeping
You come along and help me breathe

You are the only light I see (x2)

I love you
'Till the mountain starts to cry
I love you
If I don't know the reason why
I love you
Until I do not know my name
I ask you
Wouldn't you have done the same

Oh you are the only light I see
You are the only light I need
When everybody else is sleeping
You come along and help me breathe

You are the only light I see
You are the only light I need
When everybody else is sleeping
You bring the magic over me

You are the only light I see (x4)
