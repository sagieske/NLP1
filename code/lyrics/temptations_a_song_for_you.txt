A SONG FOR YOU
WRITER LEON RUSSELL
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone yea and I'm singin' this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly many times,but baby can't you see

There's no one more important to me (baby)
Baby,baby can't you please see through me 'cause we're alone now andI'm singin' this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding (but you have nothing to hide)
And now I'm so much better and if my words they don't come together
Listen to the melody (listen to the melody)
Cause my love Oo babycause my love,cause my love (Oo,Oo) is in there hiding Oo Baby
I love you in a place (in a place,3x) where there's no space or time (baby ,I love you 2X)
I love you for my life, you became a friend of mine And when my life is all over, remember when we were together
We were alone , baby
And,I was singin' this song for you
For only you ,only you O,O,O,O,O,O,OOO I was singin' my song,for nobody, but you.Â
