Song:

If you've never seen a quaint old Southern city
Just think of New, think of New Orleans

If you've never seen that town, boy, it's a pity
There's nothing like, nothing like New Orleans

It will remind you old fashioned lace
A glass of wine will greet your smiling face

And if you ever see a black-eyed gal like mine, boy
Oh, then you're right in it, right in New Orleans
