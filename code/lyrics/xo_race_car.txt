Song:

There is not one single person in the world that I owe more than you,
If I could turn back the time, wed play I Spy literally all the time,
Cause I remember your racecar, and milkshakes with fries after the doctor,
We had tales of vampires, Frankenstein, and haunted rocking chairs and theres no way your leaving just yet.

Ill give back everything I have,
If it means youll stay.
Cause my life is simply incomplete,
If its any other way

And this is so hard to have to see you like this,
I know we named you broke but I really want you fixed,
But all we can do is sit and wait here patiently,
Until I can see your face smiling up at me.
Cause I remember your racecar, and milkshakes with fries after the doctor,
And I just need you to know that in my heart youll always be with me.

Ill give back everything I have,
If it means youll stay.
Cause my life is simply incomplete,
If its any other way
And I wont give up on you I swear,
You can test me every way,
But when we finally say goodbye,
I know Ill see you again some day
