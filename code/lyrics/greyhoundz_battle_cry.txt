Verse 1:
I'll be back later before the sun sets my dear
I won't keep you waiting, I promise
We'll have candles lit over supper, by the garden where we used to... you know
Cause tomorrow will be another struggle, another battle only harder, you know this is madness

So always watch your back, watch your steps, I can't always be there to catch them bullets

Verse 2:
I can't do this on my own,
Can't stand alone against these foes, I need you to hold on
Do we stay down, drown in mud
Accept this is fate, have we gone faithless?
Do we just die, run away from crisis, have we gone hopeless?
I Can't do this on my own,
Can't stand alone against these foes, I need you to hold on, I need you to hold...

Chorus:
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
Give them what they want,
Let's give them war

Verse 3:
We chose our downfall. The once great bellato circle crumbled, now we need a miracle, we need a miracle

(Back up vocals: We end this today!)
I am your karma, your justice
Your strength has become your weakness;
I am your capital punishment, Death awaits you in a minute,
I am your karma, your justice,
I bow down to no enemy, I submit not to tyranny,
I am freedom, I am free

Chorus:
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
One by one we'll take you down
Hold your line, stand your ground
Give them what they want,
Let's give them war

Outro:
Ha! It's a shame that you have built your empire around sand.
I am the water that runs these paths, the life, the cleansing of this land
It's a shame that you have built your empire around sand.
I am the water that runs the cleansing of this land!
