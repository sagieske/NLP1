Song:

Well, there's something about my baby
I'm not really sure
But it makes other people
Stop and look at her
It's not the way she walks
It's not the clothes she wears
My baby's got big hair
She says it's her religion
When I asked her what that was
She says the higher the hair
The closer to God
Well, I guess there'll always be some things
We ain't gonna share
My baby's got big hair
The other day she's running up on Miller Ridge
She didn't check the sign
She got stuck beneath the bridge
It took the cops an hour
To get her out of there
My baby's got big hair
Well, when I take her picture
Just to get her in
I turn the camera sideways
Use a wild angle lens
It makes people laugh
But she don't seem to care
My baby's got big hair
My baby's got big hair
My baby's got big hair
