Song:

Chorus
I spend my life for you,
It's all used up,
You took it all with you,
There's nothing left,
Everywhere I go I think of you,
No matter what I do,
You're always on my mind

Walking down these empty streets,
Where are you and now I'm feeling down,
'Cause half of me has gone
I'm feeling all these tears from you
Now that I am alone they are streaming out
How can I go on?

Chorus

Everything I give to you
You have taken it all
Oh everything I give to you
You have taken it all

You have taken it all
That's why you're always in my mind

Chorus

You always on my mind..
