Song:

Here I go again
Slipping further away
Letting go again
Of what keeps me in place

I like it here
But it scares me to death
There is nothing here

The light is beautiful
But I’m darker than light
And you are wonderful
But this moment is mine

All of this dust, all of this past
All of this over and gone
And never coming back
All of this forgotten, not by me

I find comfort here
Cause I know what is lost
Hope is always fear
For the pain it may cost

And I have searched for
The reason to go on
I’ve tried and I’ve tried
But it’s taking me so long

I might be better off
Closing my eyes
And God will come looking for me
In time

All of this dust, all of this past
All of this over and gone
And never coming back
All of this forgotten, not by me

All of this dust, all of this past
All of this over and gone
And never coming back
All of this forgotten, not by me

I can see myself
I look peaceful and pale
But underneath
I can barely inhale

I can hear myself
Singing that song
Over and over
Until it belongs to me
