Song:

Louis:
The end of the night
We should say goodbye
But we carry on
While everyone's gone

Zayn:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

Liam:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine

Liam & Zayn:
Won't gooo oh oh (2x)

Liam:
So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind

Lean in when you laugh
We take photographs
There's no music on
But we dance along

Harry:
Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

Zayn:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine

Won't gooo oh oh (2x)

So baby if you say you don't want me to stay
Stay for the night
I'll change my mind

-interlude-

Zayn:
I'll change my mind

Niall:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind

All:
But baby if you say you want me to stay
I'll change my mind
Cuz I don't wanna know I'm walking away
If you'll be mine

Won't gooo oh oh (2x)

So baby if you say you want me to stay
Stay for the night

Zayn:
I'll change my mind
