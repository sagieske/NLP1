Song:

[Verse 1]
She's been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all cause she is the one
Her mom calls me love, her dad calls me son, alright, alright
I know, I know, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na (oh yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na

She belongs to me

[Verse 2]
Kisses that queen, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright
I don't exist if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright
But I know, I know, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na (oh yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)

[Bridge]
She knows, she knows
That I never let her down before
She knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let them take her love away from me now

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one cause she belongs to me

Na na na na na na (oh yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na

She belongs to me

Na na na na na na (oh yeah)
Na na na na na na (alright)
Na na na na na na

She belongs to me
