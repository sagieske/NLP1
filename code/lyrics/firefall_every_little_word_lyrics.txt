Song:

I never really came to life
'Til I held you for the first time
Please don't let it be the last time
You give yourself to me
And I want to spend all my time
Making it just like the first time
Keep you happy for a lifetime
Won't you open your arms to me?

Every little word that you say to me
Takes it's toll deep within my heart
Every little word always fills a need
Like no other love
Every little word never fades away
I just want to give my love to you
And do you want it too? Only you can say
Every little word

It's alright, just the way we feel tonight
Holding each other for the first time
Fall in love and let a star shine
For every dream we share
And life is a bittersweet paradise
To believe in each other for the first time
Keep us going for a long time
Won't you open your heart to me?

Every little word that you say to me
Takes it's toll deep within my heart
Every little word always fills a need
Like no other love
Every little word never fades away
I just want to give my love to you
And do you want it too? Only you can say
Every little word

Every little word that you say to me
Takes it's toll deep within my heart
Every little word always fills a need
Like no other love
Every little word never fades away
I just want to give my love to you
And do you want it too? Only you can say
Every little word

Every little word
Every little word
Every little word
Every little word
Every little word
