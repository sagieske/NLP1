Song:

She's tripping and flipping, flying and crying
Trying to remember her name
She's moping and groping, rope-a-dope
Washing her hair in the rain
Judy, she don't work here any more
I don't know, she might be working over at the other store
I haven't seen her in a whole month
Are you a friend of hers or what?
You stared at me till your eyeballs smoked
Was it anger or love or the caffeine in your coke
I searched my soul for the words to soothe you
But nothing that I did ever seemed to move you
Was it something that I did or didn't say?
Are you okay? I wanna know, are you okay?
Yeah, you know Judy, she could always hide but she can't run
She never knew the meaning of fun
Once she had a car, you know, her uncle gave her
But that got totalled, that's Judy
You spoke in tongues till your voice gave out
You were friendly with your demons
Of this there's little doubt
You scratched my soul with a monkey's paw
You've broken every rule, every earthly law
Was it something that I did or didn't say?
Are you okay? I wanna know, are you okay?
You caught my head in a catcher's glove
Did I somehow offend you or is this what you call love
You dropped me off at the laundromat
You gave me all your clothes but you never came back
Was it something that I did or didn't say?
Are you okay? I wanna know, are you okay
