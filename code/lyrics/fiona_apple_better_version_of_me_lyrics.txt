Song:

The nickel dropped
When I was on
My way beyond
The rubicon
What did I do

And the games that I could handle
None are ones worth a candle
What should I do

I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do

Oooh, after all the folding, rolling, hauling over cold stops
What will I do

Can't take a good day without a bad one
Don't feel just to smile until I had one
Where did I learn

I make a fuss about a little thing
Rhyme is losing to the riddling
Where's the turn

I don't want a home
I grow when that home is
Where my habits have a habitat
Why give it term

Oooh, after all the folding, rolling, hauling over cold stops
What did I learn

I am likely to miss the main event
If I stop to cry and complain again
So I will keep a deliberate pace
Let the damn breeze dry my face

Ooooh mister wait until you see
What I'm gonna be

I've got a plan, a demand and it just began
And if you're right, you'll agree

Here's coming a better version of me
Here it comes a better version of me
Here it comes a better version of me
