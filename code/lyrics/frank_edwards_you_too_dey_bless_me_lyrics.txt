Song:

Papa God you too much
The way you bless me
I never see such
I cannot deny this
The love you shower on me
Is so much
Can someone explain this?
You love me, you died for me
Even before I exist
So I can't resist all you place me
Your love for me is not to trust you
Now I know you and I love you
Cos you first love me and you chose me

Papa God you too much
I Can't keep it in
Cos I want to say it out

Verse 1

Na wetin I do
Wey make you love me so
(Wetin I do wey make you love me so)
You died on the cross just because of me(you died on the cross because of me)
You she'd your blood
Just because of me (because of me)
You are bigger than
What people say (yes you are)
And forever you will be my God

CHORUS:
You too dey bless me Ooh
Na so you love me Ooh
You too dey bless me X3

Rap 2
He died on the cross
Wasn't a joke
He rose from dead
Cos He broke the yoke
Now I'm free, I'm free indeed
This is my victory
I'm living in it
See, I'm not the one
I use to be
God's loving me
Has set me free
The chains are broken
The storm is over
Now I can lift my hands
And praise Jehovah
It's been a long time coming
God's love the source of my money
God is big
He can do anything
If He did it for Joseph
He can do it for you
Come on

You too dey bless me Ooh
Na so you love me Ooh
You too dey bless me X4

Verse 2

I look at myself
Your love is all I see
Great is thy faithfulness
Oh God, I can't deny
Your love for me
Almighty God

CHORUS
You too dey bless me Ooh
Na so you love me Ooh
You too dey bless me X4

Bridge:
My life is not the same again
Na wetin I go give you papa oh
You she'd your blood
On the cross for me
Na wetin I go give you papa oh
Oooh, Iye! 

You too dey bless me Ooh
Na so you love me Ooh
You too dey bless me X4
Idima, idima, idima, idima
Idima, idima, idima, idima 2X
Na so you love me
Na so you love me X2
