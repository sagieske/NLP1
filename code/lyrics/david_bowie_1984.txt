Song:

Someday they wont let you, now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
Youve read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on tv
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you wont care
Youll be shooting up on anything, tomorrows never there
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(mor-or-or-or-ore)

Im looking for a vehicle, Im looking for a ride
Im looking for a party, Im looking for a side
Im looking for the treason that I knew in 65
Beware the savage jaw
Of 1984

Come see, come see, remember me?
We played out an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(mor-or-or-or-ore)
