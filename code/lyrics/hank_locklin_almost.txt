Song:

Almost you fell in love with me almost you were my bride to be
But each promise that was made you have broken and betrayed
And left me with a faded memory
Almost my precious dreams came true almost you whispered dear I do
But someone new came by and you left me here to cry oh how close we were almost
Almost I heard the church bells ring almost I heard the choir sing
But I hear now instead all those unkind words you said I remember every little thing
Almost your heart I did possess almost you brought me happiness
My dreams just won't come true and there's nothing I can do
Oh how close we were almost oh how close we were almost
