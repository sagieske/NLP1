Song:

Dashing through the snow
On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tails ring,
Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it's to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

[x6]
Santa Claus is coming to town!

Frosty the snowman was a merry happy soul,
With a smokey pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal.
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day.

Thumpity, thump, thump
Thump, thump
Thumpity, thump,
Look at Frosty go
Thumpity, thump, thump
Thumpity, thump, thump
Over the hills of snow.

Santa Claus is coming to town!...

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Oh by golly, jolly have a holly,
Christmas this year.
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Oh by golly, jolly have a holly,
Christmas this year.

[x8]
Santa Claus is coming to town!...

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Don we now our g** apparel.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

[x8]
Santa Claus is coming to town!...

[x2]
Here comes Santa Claus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
There he goes, there he goes, go Santa
