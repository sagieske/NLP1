Mitchie:
We're done, but it's not over, we'll start it again
After the end of the day, it keeps getting better
Don't be afraid we'll do it together

Come on, come on, you know
It's your time to move, it's my time to move
Come on, come on, let go
Leave it all behind, your past and mine

Mitchie + Tess + Peggy + Ella + Lola:
Gone are the days of summer
We couldn't change it if we tried
Why would we want to, let's go where we got to
Our paths will cross again in time
It's never the same tomorrow
And tomorrow is never clear
So come on, come on, you know
Our time, our time is here

Mitchie:
We know, but were not certian
How can we be, how can we see what's ahead
The road keeps on turning
And all we can do, is travel each day to the next

Come on, come on, you know
It's your time to move, it's my time to move
Come on, come on, let go
Leave it all behind, your past and mine

Mitchie + Tess + Peggy + Ella + Lola:
Gone are the days of summer
We couldn't change it if we tried
Why would we want to, let's go where we got to
Our paths will cross again in time
It's never the same tomorrow
And tomorrow is never clear
So come on, come on, you know
Our time, our time is here

Mitchie:
Yeah
Tess + Peggy + Ella + Lola:
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Mitchie:
Come on, come on, come our time is here
Tess + Peggy + Ella + Lola:
Ho, ho, ho, ho

Mitchie:
Gone are the days of summer
Mitchie + Tess + Peggy + Ella + Lola:
We couldn't change it if we tried
(If we tried)
So come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
So come on, come on, you know
Our time, our time is here
(Yeah oh, yeah, oh)
