Song:

Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
I been up all night, and no suicide clock the works

Seemed to be, seemed to be, seemed to be no calm privacy
Seemed to be, seemed to be, seemed to be no calm privacy
Lucifer cried
Don't shake me Lucifer
You are all I receive

Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
I been up all night, and no suicide clock the works

They're shakin 'em down left, they're friskin 'em up right
They're shakin 'em down left, and they're friskin 'em up right
Lucifer cried
Don't shake me Lucifer
With the devil's hell's fire

Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
I been up all night, and no suicide clock works

Now the world was shakin, looking like it'd shake to bits
Now the world was shakin, looking like it'd shake to bits
Lucifer cried
Don't shake me Lucifer
I've had enough of it

Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
Don't shake me, don't shake me Lucifer
I been up all night, and no suicide clock the works
