Song:

Life it seems, slips away
Just like any dream
All I want is all I need
Still I ask for more

Say, say why is it so
Wait, wait don't let me know

Everytime I see you
My life turns upside down
Everytime I see you I know

Love it seems, slips away
Just like any dream
I failed to see this memory
Means so much to me

Say, say why is it so
Wait, wait don't let me know

Everytime I see you
My life turns upside down
Tried so hard to find out
How to make you come back
But even if I told you
I can't hold you again
Everytime I see you I know

Everytime I see you
My life turns upside down
I tried so hard to find out
How to make you come back
But even if I told you
I can't hold you again
Everytime I see you I know

Everytime I see you
My life turns upside down
Everytime I see you I know
