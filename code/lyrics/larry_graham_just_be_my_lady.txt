Just Be My Lady
And everything will be alright
Just Be My Lady
I will love you every day and night
Just Be My Lady
I promise you everything will be alright
Just Be My Lady
That's really what you alto do
Just Be My Lady
This love I have was meant for you
Just Be My Lady
Everything you ask of me sweet heart I'll do for you

My Promise to you is I'll always be true
No matter what No One, No One trys to do
To death do us part you can have my heart forever
And that's a Long, Long time

Just Be My Lady
I'm saying all I'm gonna say
Just Be My Lady
Just take my hand and I'll lead the way
Just Be My Lady
There's no never time to start the today, today

Just Be My Lady
Of Mine
Just Be My Lady

Just Be My Lady
Of Mine
Just Be My Lady
