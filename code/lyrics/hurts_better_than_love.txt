Song:

Every second is a lifetime
And every minute more brings you closer to God
And you see nothing but the red lights
You let your body burn like never before

And it feels better than love
Yeah it feels better than love

Every second is a lifetime
And every minute more brings you closer to God
And you see nothing but the red lights
You let your body burn like never before

And it feels better than love
Yeah it feels better than love

Turn away, turn away, close your eyes
You can runaway
It's not enough

Another second in the sunshine,
A decade in the dark taking part in a dream
Have you forgotten what she looks like?
Or do you only see what you want to believe?

Does it feel better than love?
Does it feel better than love?

Turn away, turn away, close your eyes
You can runaway.
It's not enough

I see the lights through the rain, oh tonight
But they never change
So what is love?

Does it feel better than love?
Does it feel better than love?

Turn away, turn away, close your eyes
You can runaway.
It's not enough

I see the lights through the rain, oh tonight
But they never change
So what is love
