Song:

You will never know how it feels
You will never know how it takes
You will never know what it brings
To me

But itґs nothing for me

Days will never reach nor ever end
And you will never preach nor ever sin
Forever, honey, is dying

And itґs nothing for me

You will never know whatґs the price
ґcause you could not ever have
Money enough nor charm enough
Forever, honey, is dying

But itґs nothing for me

I donґt deserve any last hope
If you need me

You will never fall from your grace
You could never stand all the weight
All the lead in my brain, all my pain
Itґs heavy enough and sweet enough

But itґs nothing for me

I donґt deserve any last hope
If you need me
