Song:

And... I stand all alone in a world of darkness All
sanctity is washed away By
crimson storm of false promises Of
human decay We

have betrayed our god Now
we worship the iron sword We
have forsaken the truth Mislaid
by a single word Told

by unseized hunger For
blood flesh, control, They
have burnt our eyes They
have burnt our soul Merciless

beaten, by fear Cruel
lies No... saviours in here I!

have walked to the battle under hot steaming sun I,
have lost my life I, have buried my sons I've,
believed in their words I, believed in their lies I've
walked through the bloodshed now, my cold blood cries Turn!

my blood into wine And
they will pour it into a glass They'll
take a sip Yet
will never know how painful it tasted Turn

my eyes blind I
will wander through time We
were given holy earth Now
it is defiled The!

Terror unleashed The
horror is pure Pain
deep underneath Hidden
obscure, The

Terror unleashed The
horror is pure Pain
deep underneath Hidden
obscure, We

are nothing but ashes And
cold graves of stone As
we keep on wandering In
darkness All, Alone We

are nothing but ashes And
cold graves of stone As
we keep on wandering In
darkness All, Alone
