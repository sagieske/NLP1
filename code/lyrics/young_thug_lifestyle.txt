Real hommie

[Hook - Young Thug:]
I've done did a lot of s**t just to live this here lifestyle
We came straight from the bottom to the top, my lifestyle
N***a livin' life like a beginner and this only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and n****s still beginnin'

[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]
Million 5 on a Visa card
Hundred bands still look like the fu***n' tires
N***a servin' great white like I'm feedin' sharks
I won't do nothin' with the b***h, she can't even get me high
Somethin' wrong with the p***y
Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'm a still make sure that she Gucci it
'Cause with me and my rally, only caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J
(Who said money?)
Hop up in my bed full of forty b*****s and yawnin'
Hey, think this a show b***h you performin'
I do this s**t for my daughters and all my sons, b***h
I'm a run up them bands, I'll take out their funds, b***h
I got a moms b***h, she got a moms b***h
I got sisters and brothers to feed
I ain't goin' out like no idiot, I'm a og

[Hook - Young Thug:]

N***a livin' life like a beginner and this only the beginnin'
I'm on the top of the mountain, puffin' on clouds and n****s still beginnin'

[Verse 2 - Young Thug:]
Still screamin' "Fuck the otherside"
I'm a ride for my n***a, aye
And I'm a die for my n***a, aye
Ain't gonna be latching on my n****s aye
N***a couldn't see me if they had a genie
I'm a live my life like Bennie, R.I.P. My brother Bennie
I stack my racks to the ceiling, now these n****s can't beat me
I just might wake up when Chanel and these b*****s can't see me
I'm in a whole 'nother league
I ain't got aids but I swear to God I would bleed 'til I D. I. E.
28 floors up I feel like I could F. L. Y. E. E.
Pee on top of these b*****s
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me
I'm in that coffin with baby mommy gettin' sloppy toppy
I'm bleedin' red like a devil, I see these b*****s plotting
They wanna know how I got M's and I didn't finish college

[Verse 3 - Rich Homie Quan:]
I do it for my daddy, I do it for my mama
Them long nights, I swear to God I do it for the come up
I'm Willie B beating on my chest, in the jungle, aye
Money on money, I got commas in every bank
Sunday through Monday I've been grindin' with no sleep
Talkin' 'bout takin' somethin' from me, like no way
Thugger Thugger, that's my brother, brother
You don't want no trouble trouble or you can get these fists, knuckle knuckle
Buckle up like a seatbelt or I'll shoot yah
Punchin' on the gas, too fast, and I lose yah
Give me a bed, I'll do her, I want a head, Medusa
I swear a n***a gone cause this strong I'm blowin' super
Grindin' for a new day
I'm skatin', like that n***a Lupe
Hey, I'm on the top just like toupee
Hey, I'm in her mouth just like toothpaste

[Hook - Young Thug:]

N***a livin' life like a beginner and this only the beginnin'
