Song:

This is for you (this is for you).
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.

Lets sneak out the back, so we can see
What it took to bring us here and be here.
So reminded of better days,
When we were both happy.

This is for you (this is for you).
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.

This is for you (this is for you).
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.

Words can't express,
The impact you've made on me,
In my entire life.
And all I can say is that I love you,
For everything it serves out.

This is for you (this is for you).
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.

This is for you (this is for you).
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.

Cause I try,
So hard to make this right (right).

You've got my back on the wall.

After all you've put me through,
My friends still stay true.

After all you've put me through,
My friends still stay true.

Your reign is over,
Why couldn't you prove me wrong.

Your reign is over,
Why couldn't you prove me wrong.
