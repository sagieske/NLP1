Song:

Hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by, hardly a day goes by

All the candles are still burning
Like they were the final day,
And I know the world will turn until tomorrow
Will the candles be burning then, if it's still today?

Hardly a day goes by, or night falls
All the seconds in the universe collide,
If you could read my mind, from your world (if you could read my mind)
All the scenes I'm left to dream, I walk alone

Hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by

Feel the fire through the darkness
Should I turn and walk away?
I believe the time will come for our tomorrow,
And I dream of eternity, but it's still today

Hardly a day goes by, or night falls
All the seconds in the universe collide,
If you could read my mind, (if you could read my mind) from your world
All the scenes I'm left to dream, I walk alone

Hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by, hardly a day goes by

Hardly a day goes by
I've been lost inside a moment for too long
Hardly a day goes by, or night fall
I've been lost inside a moment for too long

Hardly a day goes by
