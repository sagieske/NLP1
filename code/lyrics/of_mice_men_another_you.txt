Song:

Words wear off, nervous paces.
Something's off, see it in their faces.

[Chorus:]
Say anything, say anything,
Say anything that could make this all okay.
Take it away, take it away,
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
'Cause I will never find another you.

Another you, another you.

I still hear you in this house (whispering).
I still feel you in my bones (in these veins).
And like the portraits in the halls (can't help but think),
I wish you were staring back at me (but you're gone).

[Chorus:]
Say anything, say anything,
Say anything that could make this all okay.
Take it away, take it away.
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
'Cause I will never find another (I may never find myself)
I will never find another you

So I'll carry you with me in my dreams, my memory.
So I'll carry you with me (you'll always be with me) in my dreams, my memory.
So I'll carry you with me, you'll always be my memory.

[Chorus:]
Say anything, say anything,
Say anything that could make this all okay.
Take it away, take it away.
Take away all of this emptiness I feel
'Cause I will never find another (I may never find myself)
And I will never find another you
