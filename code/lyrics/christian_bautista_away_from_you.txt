Song:

[Intro:]
There were times that I just wanna cry with all the strain
There were moments of uncertainty and pain
But when you are there to help and care, I smile again
But here am I so alone away from you
[Chorus:]
Everyday I can only pray for your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you
I have searched throughout the world a lot of things I've seen
I have pondered many possibilities
Then you come along, you make me strong so stay with me
Why am I on my own without you
[Chorus:]
On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you
[Chorus:]
Everyday I can only pray for your warm, lovin' arms
To take me away from all the emptiness, despair
Why do I have to be away from you
Please don't let me be
[Chorus:]
On my own so far away I long from your warm lovin' arms
Into the cold, dark emptiness of hurt, despair
I don't wanna be away from you
