Song:

What if I could change the world
One day at a time?
I'd go back and stay
Too much is gone to even try
Shallow in depth
So I see everything so clearly
I would take it back again
I'd take it blind (take you blind)

You say, I don't
But oh, would you come
And take me
Away
Away from here
You say, I won't
But love, won't you come
And take me
Away
Away from here

This is in reversal
Everyone is hurt here
Fell from you so high
Beat me like a drum
Now you finally have won
I'm wounded again

I say,
What if I could change your world
One day at a time?
I'd be waiting for someone
To change my mind
Change my mind

You say, away
Oh love, won't you come
And take me
Away
Away from here
You stay away
Oh love, won't you come
And take me
Away
Away from here
(Oooh)

What if I could change your world
One day at a time?
