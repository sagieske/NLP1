Song:

I know what it's like to be forgotten
Left alone with your simple dreams
Even they are fading fast
No one to turn to, no one to hold at night
And waking up to another day that'll soon be over
And if you think time has forgotten you
Well just look into my eyes and see the love we share

Don't hold back your love, 'cause I know it's here-ere
I wanna see it come to life before my eye-eye-eyes

Don't be mistaken, there's still work to do
Gotta get up every single day and face the judge and jury
No one will notice, they've got their own lives
We got somethin' they ain't got
Someday it'll be there surprise
And if you think there is no place to ru-un
Just hold on to my hand and face the melti-ing sun

Don't hold back your love, 'cause I know it's here-ere
I wanna see it come to life before my eye-eye-eyes
Don't hold back your lo-o-ove, show me your hear-ear-eart
And I will aways be here by your side...

One more chance to find the middle ground
One more chance before the sun goes down
One more night to hold you in my ar-arms again

Don't hold back your love, 'cause I know it's here-ere
I wanna see it come to life before my eye-eye-eyes
Don't hold back your lo-o-ove, show me your hear-eart
And I will always be here by your side
Don't hold back your love
Don't hold back your love, show me your hear-eart
And I will always be here by your side
Don't hold back your love
Don't hold back your love, show me your hear-eart
I wanna see it come to life before my eyes...
Don't hold back your love, don't hold back your love

Don't hold back your love, don't hold back your lo-ove
Don't hold b
