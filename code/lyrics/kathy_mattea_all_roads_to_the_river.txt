Song:

A thousand stars in the sky like the stars in your eyes
They say to me that therell never be
No other love like you-oo for me-e-e
A thousand stars in the sky make me realize
You are the one love that I'll adore
Tell me you love me
Tell me you're mine once more (once more, once mo-o-ore)
Each night I count the stars in the sky
Hoping that you aren't telling me lies
Youre with me tonight, I'm captured by your charms
Oh, pretty baby, wont you hold me in your arms?
A thousand stars in the sky make me realize
You are the one love that I'll adore
Tell me you love me
Tell me you're mine once more (once more, once mo-o-ore)
Each night I count the stars in the sky
Hoping that you aren't telling me lies
Youre with me tonight, I'm captured by your charms
Oh, pretty baby, wont you hold me in your arms?
A thousand stars in the sky make me realize
You are the one love that I'll adore
Tell me you love me
Tell me you're mine once mo-o-re (I-I-I'm yours)
