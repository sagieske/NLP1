Introduction

Qg (Innerstate Ike)

Ya know
(Rose Gold)
Hey man you gotta enjoy life
(Innerstate Ike)
Atleast that's while you can that is. You know the funny part about this s**t each and everyday we getting older and older,
(I feel you) but a lot of times we forgetting that we getting older.
You can't live in the moment man cause its non existent!

Chorus

Now we gonna party hard,
And watch us get it crunk!
Ain't stopping til the morning,
Just watch us live it up!
Ain't got no time to waste,
You only do it once!
So pop another bottle,
And tell em drink up!

Now watch us live it up
Watch us live it up
You gotta enjoy it man you only live once!
(repeat x2)

Q. G verse

Hey watch us live it up,
And we not leaving out this m**********are til we drunk!
Higher than the sky, on cloud nine,
And death ain't on my mind,
Cause I'm living my life,
A drug cannot replace this,
Ballin operation, told me it took patience,
I just gotta pace it,
But I ain't sitting waiting, I'm just tryna go,
Party til I can't and let my money triple fold!
And hey the night is looking young man, where we bout to go?
And you can call the hoes,
And Imma call my bros,
Yeah I'll let them know,
Where we about to be,
And if they got some weed,
Then tell them they can match with me,
& hey we hiding past time as the world spin,
Gotta get it quick up in this whirlwind,
I promise imma shine before the world end,
Get it for my children and my girl man!
Yeah..

Chorus

Now we gonna party hard,
And watch us get it crunk!
Ain't stopping til the morning,
Just watch us live it up!
Ain't got no time to waste,
You only do it once!
So pop another bottle,
And tell em drink up!

Now watch us live it up
Watch us live it up
You gotta enjoy it man you only live once!
(repeat x2)

Innerstate Ike verse

Imma light the dro,
Sometimes I hear the devil,
He be knocking at my door,
They ain't chasing dreams,
Cause they probably scared!
Like a bee -beautiful,
Call it Halle Berry,
Watch out for these haters,
The sky is the limit!
We ridin' with a gun that's the size of a midget!
My momma told me get it,
So imma go and chase it!
I came from the bottom,
I'm talking bout the basement!
Me and motivation is the best of friends,
Told them that success is the best revenge!
Got a date with faith, riding with destiny!
I'm living it up! Getting moneys my specialty!
You might fall so you gotta keep cushion,
So like a skateboard, imma keep pushing!
Yeah I came from rags to riches,
Bellside n****s f**k the baddest b*****s.

Chorus

Now we gonna party hard,
And watch us get it crunk!
Ain't stopping til the morning,
Just watch us live it up!
Ain't got no time to waste,
You only do it once!
So pop another bottle,
And tell em drink up!

Now watch us live it up
Watch us live it up
You gotta enjoy it man you only live once!
(repeat x2)
