Song:

Tell me you're mine
Tell me you're mine to break the ice
Does he make you smile?
Does he fully embrace the way?
Does he lead you to the fight that you like?

Who is this guy?
This twee neophyte
Does he know that I'll wait for all time?
Does he make you right?

Does he say that he'd like to know you?
Does he say that he wants to know?
All of the ways you will make it up, make it up for me?

Tell me you're fine
Tell me it's hard to fake it time after time
Tell me who is this guy

Does he say that he'd like to know you?
Does he say that he wants to know?
All of the ways you will make it up, make it up for me?

Make it up for me
All of the ways you will make it up, make it up for me?
Make it up for me

I know the way you will make it up, make it up for me
I know the way you will make it up, make it up for me
I know the way you will make it up, make it up for me
I know the way you will make it up, make it up for me
