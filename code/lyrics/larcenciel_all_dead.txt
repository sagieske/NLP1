Song:

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you're gone
I wish you're all dead
Undying love

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you're gone
I wish you're all dead

I want to give him
The same scars, the same pain
I want to give him
A nightmare from which he can't escape
Maddening fear again and again
Unchanging love

Say so long!

You stole my freedom
This pain never lessens
Tell me, how long will it last?
Tell me you're haunted
By this murderous intent that never lessens

It's time to fall
It's time to say goodbye
I wish you're gone
I wish you're all dead
All dead
All dead
