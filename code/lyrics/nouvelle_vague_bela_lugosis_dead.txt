Song:

White on white translucent black capes
Back on the rack

Bela Lugosi's dead
The bats have left the bell tower
The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines, the black box

Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead

The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room, the count

Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead, undead, undead

Undead, undead, undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead, undead, undead
