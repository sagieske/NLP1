You lavish your love on a thousand generations
You search the horizon and you run to the thirsty 
I can feel your heart beating for your people
You sing and dance rejoicing over us

I'm gonna dance in your love, oh
I'm gonna sing in your love, oh
I'm gonna shout in  your love, oh
In your love

You lavish your love on a thousand generations
You search the horizons and you run to the thirsty
I can feel your heart beating for your people 
You sing and dance rejoicing over us

Chorus:
I'm Getting lost in your love, oh
I'm getting found In your love, oh
I'm coming alive in your love, oh
In your love

Let your hope rise, let your bride shine,
Let your glory be revealed through your sons and daughters (2x)

Your love means everything to me (3x)
(Oh lord, your love means everything)

I'm getting lost In your love, oh
I'm getting found in your love, oh
I'm coming alive in your love, oh
In your love
