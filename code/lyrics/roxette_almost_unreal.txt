Song:

Babe, come in from the cold and put that coat to rest.
Step inside, take a deep breath, and do what you do best.
Yes, kick off them shoes and leave those city streets.
I do believe love came our way, and fate did arrange for us to meet.

I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.

Hey, we can't stop the rain, let's find a place by the fire.
Sometimes I feel, strange as it seems,
You've been in my dreams all my life.

I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.

It's a crazy world out there. It's a crazy...
Let's hope our prayers are in good hands tonight.

Oh, I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal.
It's almost unreal, so unreal.

Yea come on and do the hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal, yea.

It's almost unreal. Do the hocus pocus to me. Do the hocus pocus...
