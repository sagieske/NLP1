Song:

Your warm embrace has been replaced by cold
And those defiant eyes have fallen
Broken by the Floor
Another rain-streaked face
Left alone to drown in malice
And your bleeding heart can only heal so much
We can't weather this storm of longer
And water cannot cleanse the blood from our past
Can you hear your crying wish?
Because your prayers remain... Answerer less
Your prayers remain
In sweet decay
Your prayers remain
In this sweet decay
Your Love failed me
Broken hearts and shattered dreams could never carry your fractured world
So just throw it all away
Your love is lost on us
Just throw is all away
Your love is lost on us
