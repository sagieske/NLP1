[Intro:]

Oooh, now you are one lucky n***a
You gotta listen to your boss white boy
Oh I’m gonna walk in the middle of the night with you
You wanna hold my hand?

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they a** in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord
Black coffins! (I need a hundred…)

[Verse:]
I seen a hundred n****s die;
I put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn’t tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block, look like I’m Big Daddy Kane
Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back, get tattoes all around
Hundred dead b*****s, hundred black coffins
Money on his head, b***h, I’m trying to make a fortune

[Hook:]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they a** in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord
Black coffins! (I need a hundred…)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I seen a hundred women burn, as they stood firm
Treat a n***a like a germ, what did she do to deserve?
Put me on the farm
Pigs’ feet in a jar; serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang ‘em, better pray for Jack Django
Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!)
On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, b***h cause I’m coming
Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!)
Hundred dead b*****s, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)
12th gate, short gun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom)

[Hook:]
I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves so I can lay they a** in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (oh, Lord
Black coffins! (I need a hundred…)
