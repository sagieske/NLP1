Song:

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that carried me
The sigh that blew me forward

'Cause it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

And my running feet could fly
Each breath screaming
We are all too young to die

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine it crept

Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine it crept

'Cause it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs

Gone are all the days of begging
The days of theft
No more gasping for a breath
The air filled me head to toe
And I can see the ground far below
I have this breathe and I hold it tight
And I keep it in my chest with all my might
I pray to god this breath will last
As it pushes past my lips as I...
Gasp (x3)
