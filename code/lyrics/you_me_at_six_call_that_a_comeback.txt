Song:

I've got a bad feeling,
That I went and got dirt on your name,
And you swear you heard them say.
That is the guy who makes the biggest mistakes oh,
He said, she said, that I'm a joke.
The kind of hoax that leaves a lump in your throat,
From what I hear I still maintain some class.
And if you let me be your first,
I swear I'll be your last.
And all the rumors that you may have heard,
Have left a mark and striped you of your worth.

And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.
And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.

You've got a god feeling that,
I went and got dirt on your name and,
You swear you heard them say.
That giving up will be your biggest mistake,
I've got a spot for blondes and green eyes.
I am falling faster and it frames no surprise,
Shallow is as shallow does.
And if you let me have my way,
I swear I'll tear you apart.
All I've got is what I bare in these arms,
The saddest part is that is not enough.

And everybody knows.

And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.
And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.

And all I've got is what you don't,
Wanna know where I will go,
The saddest part is I am not with you.

And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.
And I never meant to go,
I'm leaving you the only way I know.

You're a champ,
Itching for comeback,
But you're an inch, an inch away,
You're a champ itching for a comeback so stay.
