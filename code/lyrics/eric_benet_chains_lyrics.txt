Song:

Break the chain


Tracy is a good girl
Sweet 16
Her daddy's in her bedroom
Makes her feel unclean
She's slave to a secret
That her dad and she keep together


Nathan is a genius
Or at least he was
Nat traded future for a glass-pipe-buzz
Nat lives on the streets now
For $20 bills he'll do whatever


Chorus:
Don't stop breaking the chains
Don't stop breakin' away
Don't be afraid of breaking the chains
It's up to no one else
You've got to free yourself


Rosie is a waitress at the airport lounge
She gave up on her dreams
Her self esteem's broke down
Now she stares out the window
Watching people fly around forever


Chorus


Make a change don't you be afraid, go on
Free your mind from the fear inside
And you won't be chained anymore


Look here I'm a black man
And they say I'm free
Seems like somebody s'til got chains on me


Well we got brothers killing brothers
Leaving young mothers to raise a family
We gotta stay together to make it better


Chorus out
