Song:

The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
So act all innocent, Even though iv seen your true face
Stop lying to yourself; you're nothing but a f*****g disgrace
You're a f*****g disgrace
How can you trust anyone when you can't even trust your friends?
A masquerade of lies will kill us all in the end
The worst part of it all is I'm exactly the same
I'm looking around the room
I'll be the first one to blame
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
Take another look inside of yourself[
Look at the mess you've made
Take another look inside yourself
You're living in a masquerade
You're just a two-faced piece of s**t
I'll make sure all you cowards quit
So hide yourself behind a mask
In a room of double faces
You can never hide what's in your past
Nothing changes at all, I'm still exactly the same
I'm looking around the room
I'll be the first to blame
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
We dance in a spell of lust, those eyes of yours I cannot trust
The scent of lies is in the air tonight
Those eyes, those eyes
To everyone who's held me up and everyone who's brought me down
I will never forget your faces, your voices
Wink and smile for a while behind a mask
In a room of double faces you can never hide what's in your past
