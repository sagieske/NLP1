Song:

Even if a day feels to long
You feel like you can wait another one
And you've slowly given up on everything
Love is gonna find you again
Love is gonna find you, you better be ready then
Well you been kneeling in the dark for far too long
You've been waiting for that spark but it hasn't come
I'm calling to you please get off the floor
A good heart will find you again
A good heart will find you just be ready then
Tethered to a bird of sorrow
A voice that's buried in the hollow
You've given over to self-deceiving
You prostrate bow but not believing
You've squandered more than you could borrow
You bet your joy on all tomorrows for the hope of some returning
While everything around you is burning
Come on we gotta get out get out of this mess we've made
And still for all our talk we're both so afraid
But will we leave this up to chance like we do everything
Love is gonna find us again
Love is gonna find us you gotta be ready then
Tethered to a bird of sorrow
A voice that's buried in the hollow
You've given over the self- deceiving
You prostrate bow but not believing
You've squandered more than you could borrow
You bet your joy on all tomorrows for the hope of some returning
While everything around you is burning
But I'm not leaving yet
I'm not leaving yet
I'm not leaving yet
I'm not leaving yet
Yeah I'm not leaving
I'm not leaving yet
Yeah I'm hanging on
I'm hanging on
Oh what's gonna come
Oh I'm hangin on
Hangin on hangin on hangin on hanging on hanging on hanging on
And the fateful with the faithful I'm hanging on
What's gonna come oh, what's gonna come
Hanging on hanging on with the faithful the faithful
