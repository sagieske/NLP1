Song:

[Chorus:]

I don't like the work but true I need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
Peolpe all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you

Time after time I say to myself
Working all my life isn't good for my health
Get old, get tired, get put on the shelf
I do all the work, someone else gets all the wealth
Wish I was on an island in the sun
Where I woouldn't have to worry how to get things done

[Chorus:]

I don't like the work but true I need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
Peolpe all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you

Day after day becomes more of a grind
Bills pile up, moneys harder to find
Trying to get ahead money's harder to find
If I don't give it up i'm gonna lose my mind
Wish I was on an island in the sun
Where I wouldn't have to worry how to get things done

[Chorus:]

I don't like the work but true I need the money
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny
Peolpe all around, telling me what to do
And all I want to do is stay at home with you
