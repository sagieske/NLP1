Song:

Watching you walk out the door
I think I've seen it all before
But this time's different
This time's not the same
All those memories of us are gone
How could all this be wrong?
This time's different
You won't be back again
Those war winning loves they fade so fast
I hoped this one was meant to last
Maybe just maybe, maybe, baby

Can't leave love in the Sun like that
A heart may die it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To memor these words baby
Can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive baby
Memor these words for better or worse

We can only go back in time
Maybe we can see the reason why
But this time's different
This time's not the same
All those awful things I've shouldn't of said
Why can we just forgive and forget
Thinking this time's different
You won't be back again
Those war winning loves they fade so fast
I hoped this one was meant to last
Maybe just maybe, maybe, baby

Can't leave love in the Sun like that
A heart may die it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To memor these words baby
Can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive baby
Memor these words for better or worse

From the moment you come I has to feel your touch
You already broke my heart
One reason is not enough baby please

Those war winning loves they fade so fast
I hoped this one was meant to last
Maybe just maybe, maybe, baby

Can't leave love in the Sun like that
A heart may die it's a matter of fact
And it's up to us
To memor these words baby
Can't keep that heartbreak trapped inside
We gotta let it go to keep our love alive baby
Memor these words for better or worse
For better our worse
Memor these words for better or worse
