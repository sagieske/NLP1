[Intro:]
Eightball-
Ah yeah! Eightball & mjg in the mothaf*%kin house,
And we came here today to talk to you about this thang called pimpin.
It has been misunderstood over the years, so now, we come to set the record straight. N****s don't do this sh*i right it takes a special kinda n***a, knowatimsayn'? Yeah!

Eightball-
It takes a n***a that's hard from the start, you gotta have heart,
To meet a b*ich, mack her then rip her apart.
It's all in the game, a n***a can't change,
If you don't break a b*thc then your game is lame mane.
See I'm from Tennessee, with curls and gold teeth, so everywhere I go b*thces strike up conversations with me.
About the way I talk, about the way I dress,
About how my gold teeth look so fresh.
See how I bait 'em in soon as a n***a speak,
That G's voice just make a b*tch knees weak.
I'm in my caddilac, chillin like a fat mac,
Smokin on a fat sac, drinkin on a pint of 'yac.
I pick up my car phone 'cause a freak beeped,
It's my n****s baby mama but some times I creep.
That's just the way it is n****s have to take a chance,
When you ain't around anybody could be in that a**.
But I'm just a young n***a tryin to make a dolla,
And the way I live, to some it's hard to swallow.
See living down south ain't what you think it be,
Nine times outta ten n****s like me, pimps.
(yeah, that's right, tryin to teach all these lames
How to do this sh*t, 'cause it's really a hard job.
But them lame n****s, they make me get so high)

Course-(Woman/eightball)
And I just can't stand to get my feet off the ground
(i get so high)
And I just can't stand to get my feet off the ground
(i get so high)

Mjg-
Now let me explain a pimp a n***a about the m-o-n-e-y
See a hoe break a hoe, and try to influence the b*tch
To turn a trick for the n***a who, presuaded her to sell a**
Like a hoe is supposed to
Now how the f*ck you think as pimp is slippin?
Surrounded by all these hoes that's going and giving me money
It's funny how a hoe could make you thinks she's wit 'cha
When all the time she's just another n****s gold digger
Mjg got a b*tch for a rich trick, take of your business,
Bring me my money, yeah this sh*t is thick
Hoe don't violate, b*itch you know I taught you better,
Take all his cash, grab on his a**, write that trick a love letter.
Train your woman to break a man, man meaning another n***a
Just some sh*t in the game same 'ol same to make your pimpin bigger
Slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the b*tch,
mjg is rich, I'm coo-coo for these tricks, I'm a pimp.
(yeah that's right baby, I'm pimpin so what you need to do is
Set that a** out and uh, right about now I'm finna fire up one of these spliffs, and get so high)

Course-(Woman/Mjg)

Eightball-
Part two, it's all the same g,
Trying to school fools on this P-I-M-P
Lesson 1- first you should, pull a b*tch f*ck her good
The next time tell her no, but the next time take her dough.
Oh! You gotta watch your back too mane
'cause there's a lot of b*tches in the world with much game
Lesson 2 watch that hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
Never let a b*tch know how you make your cash flow
Lesson 3- if you don't tell that how who is boss,
B*tches like to run sh*t but end up gettin smacked in the mouth
See a real n***a believe in beatin them hoes down
Push her head into the wall til you hear the crackin sound
Drown in the tub, rub-a-dub dub
Some n****s get pu*sy whipped then fall into a love bug
Buyin hoes this, buyin hoes that, then braggin to your friends
How you f*ck her from the back
Never how you took they cash, never how you beat they a**
Never how you pull hoes, f*ck 'em then drop 'em fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
You should be around n****s like me pimps
(yeah man these n****s a trip knowatimsayin?
But n****s like me, I have to smoke them spliffs to keep my mind off that sh*t, but when I smoke, I get so high)

Course-(Woman/eightball)

Mjg-
Where ever there's a hoe there's bound to be a pimp
The pimp supplies his b*tches with some tricks that they can attempt
A sucker will spend all his money 'til he ain't got nothing left
Instead of blaming a b*tch he needs to blame it on himself
It wouldn't be a hoe if it wasn't for the trick
But I suggest we keep 'em so a pimp can keep his b*tch
It needs to understood, there wouldn't be one without the other
So why in the hell these folks tryin to sweat a mother f*cka
Jealous sucka just maaad they can't hang wit the pimp thang
Looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimps game
How in the f*ck do you figure that pimpin is dead
When n***a you know it's alive pimpin been misunderstood
By those who can't that's why they said it died
Others tried pimpin but was only making chump-change
One track minded n****s never run a m-train
Re-arrange sh*t that they done seen in a movie script
Damn aint that a b*tch (echo)
n****s like me, a pimp
(Mj f*ckin G, P-I-M-P, stand down on this pimpin
About these hoes, but some n****s f*cks it up for real n****s
And that sh*t just makes me get so high)

Course-(until fades out)
