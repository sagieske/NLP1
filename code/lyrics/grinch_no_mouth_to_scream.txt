Song:

I just had no head, it had no wings
And when I woke that bird was me
They came and ripped my tongue from me
They came and stripped the flesh from me
They came and ripped my tongue from me
I have no mouth and I must scream
Probing my brain to see what scares me
What horrors there could be
Unconscious, nowhere left to hide
Trapped: Dreaming inside
Programmed for abject misery
The subject's changed radically
Laughing contorted faces leer and scream
No way to stop them coming
There are no more tears to cry
They look into mirrored eyes
Torment in the images I reflect
Fear is just a concept
I just had another dream
Saw a bird fly upon mended wings
It flew so high if flew so free
If I closed my eyes I could hear it sing
