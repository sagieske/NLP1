Song:

Biscuits for breakfast, cup of tea for the man
4 more years of this s**t and i'll be on 16 grand
Pushing the trolley, doing the rounds
4 more years of this s**t and i'll be one of these clowns

In my office
On the fifth floor
Biscuits for breakfast
Biscuits for breakfast

Biscuits for breakfast, cup of tea for the man
4 years on in this game and I'm on 16 grand
I want chocolate, gimme some cake
Gimme so much more than I think I can take

In my office
On the fifth floor
Biscuits for breakfast
Biscuits for breakfast

Over a barrel, or over my trolley
Over the desk it's all the same
Pushing the message don't hate the player hate the game
S'all the same

In my office
On the fifth floor
I can see the world go round beneath me
Biscuits for breakfast
I can see my world pan out before me

I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
I can see my world pan out before me
