Song:

There must be some kinda way way out of here
Oh said the joker to the thief
I want to tell you now
You know theres just too much confusion
And I cant no I cant get no relief
Ah these businessmen they all they drink our wine
And the plowman well he dig my earth
And you know that ah none of them along the line
Can show me what any of this is worth
You know we wanted to see it now didnt we
Didnt we

There aint no reason to get excited
Ah the thief you know he kindly spoke
Well now there are those among us right here right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
But you and I we have been through that
I tell you that this this is not our fate no no no
Now let us all not talk falsely now
You know the hour well its getting late

I said all along the watchtower
The princes they kept the view
While the women the women
They came and then they went
And barefoot servants too
Thats me thats you
But outside theres a cold distance
Listen for the wildcats
Here them growl
Two riders were approaching
As the wind began to howl
I said now shelter me

Oh there are those among us right here right now
Who still see life as some kind of a joke
All along the watchtower
I said all along this watchtower
Those of you who still have eyes to see
Ears hear me
You will be saved by grace in the end
Saved by time if you dont understand
That your hatred is rooted in your fear
And your paranoia and insecurities
Well they dont belong here
You got to take someones hand
You got to learn to make your stand
And its one two three four
Look at the sky you can open the door
And take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Ah dont you want to touch
Dont you want to feel
Dont you know that this is real
I said shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me
Shelter me
And save yourself
Save yourself
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save your
Save
And you
You
And you are a part of the world
You you are a part of the world
You gotta learn to touch to feel
And know that you are real
I said learn learn
You are a part of the world
