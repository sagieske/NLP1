Song:

For Lack There of I Can't Define
Is There Another Way
I've Had Enough I've Paid The Price
To Keep The Beast At Bay

Feel The Undertow of Words Unspoken
Hear The Blunders of The Masses Broken

You Have My Sympathy

Now Take It Away

Unleash The Whores Unlock The Doors
Emotion I'll Bask In
Let's Break The Glass Containing Past
Don't Look Back Again

Feel The Undertow of Words Unspoken
Hear The Blunders of The Masses Broken

You Have My Sympathy

Come On Take It All Away
Come On Take It All Away Now
Come On Take It All Away
Come On Take It All Away Now

Come On Take It All Away
Come On Take It All Away Now
Come On Take It All Away
Come On Take It All Away Now

Now Take It Away
Come On Take It Away
Come On Take It Away
Take It Away
