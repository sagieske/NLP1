Song:

[Intro: B. O. B]
I want everything I see
I wanna go in every mall in every state in every country and buy s**t
Whether I can afford it or not ni**a,
I want b*****s, I want cars, I don't give a f**k, I want it all
That's what the f**k we're here for

[Bridge: B. O. B]
Say enough about a dream n***a
I'm just tryna keep it real n***a

It's just so many woman
It's just so many chains
It's just so many watches
It's just too many things
I want!

It's just so many trips
It's just so many bottles
It's just too many whips
It's just too many models
I want!

[Hook: B. O. B]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
That's all I want
Big faced honey
Honey, honey, honey
That's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want

[Verse 1: B. O. B]
Not a day's goes by
It ain't on my mind
I ain't gon front
I ain't gon lie
I'd rather have an em
Than an empty pocket
If honeys ain't in them
Them jeans ain't mine, I
I swear I won m*******a
I'll never be a bum m*******a
We talking about like it ain't about the money
We just sound like a dumb m*******a

A house on the hill by the lake
All real n****s can relate
You tryna book me for free?
But my rent is due on today
I better life is what we're after
'cause every dream I gotta capture
I always knew that I would blow up one day
Like a nuclear reactor

[Hook: B. O. B]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
That's all I want
Big faced honey
Honey, honey, honey
That's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want

[Verse 2: B. O. B]
From the cradle to a label
From the cater to the majors to papers, no more neighbors
I used to say I never cared about the money until I put food on my momma's table
Follow the trail
Could've been in jail
The way that I live
Could have been fatal
Must have had an angel
It's funny how I'm always on the screen
But as a teen I never had cable
But now I won it all
The world, the ladies, the whips
I took a fantasy and made it exist
No one ever handed a s**t
We took what we had and made it this s**t
That's transforming dust to this to luxury
Being off in the cut, the cutlery
That's the jist that's the summary
So if you feel how I'm feeling then f**k with me!

[Hook and Bridge: B. O. B]
All I want is money
Money, money, money
That's all I want
Big faced honey
Honey, honey, honey
That's all I want, that's all I want
That's all I want, that's all I want

Say enough about a dream n***a
I'm just tryna keep it real n***a

It's just so many woman
It's just so many chains
It's just so many watches
It's just too many things
I want!

It's just so many trips
It's just so many bottles
It's just too many whips
It's just too many models
I want!
