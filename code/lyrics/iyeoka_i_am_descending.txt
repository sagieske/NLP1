Song:

I am descending
I am binding time
I'm trying to hold on to
Our sweetest memories

I can still feel you
Your lips on all of me
Your skin in between the silk
Still moving me

You are

You are validating
That my search for love
Is closer to you to me
Souls separated by six degrees

You are the fire inside of me
The blue sky in a sea of dreams
You are the ripples in ecstasy
That pales all fantasies

You are my tomorrow
You are my every yesterday
I am trying to hold on to
These words we used to say
I love you...

But where are we now
Where are we now

Until tomorrow comes
I wait for all of your love
I am trying to hold on to
These words we used to say

I am descending
You are still my rising sun
We are, we are the in between of love
The never failing... The hallelujah of love
We are, You are, You are
I am trying to hold on to
These words we used to say

I love you
