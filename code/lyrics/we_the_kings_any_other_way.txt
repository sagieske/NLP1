Song:

I am wide awake
And I'm standing tall
Up against the world
Up against the wall
Between the love and hate
They can hardly wait
To watch their hero fall

You could give me hell
You could give me death
Break before I bend
I will have revenge
Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way

Feel the poison now
Slipping through my skin
I'm not giving up
But I'm giving in
To my darker side
To my every sin
So I can fight again

You could give me hell
You could give me death
Break before I bend
I will have revenge
Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
Any other way

Woah oh oh ohh oh oh
Any other way
Woah oh oh ohh oh oh

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way
I will never go down
Any other way

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way
I will never go down
Any other way

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way
Any other way

Woah oh oh ohh oh oh...
