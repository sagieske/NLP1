Song:

Yeah, I represent loyalty, I am loyalty
I am the definition of loyalty
I represent the G's, Beanie Sigel
We the best

All the bullshit stops here, let's get this clear
Shoot rear fresh off the top tier
What I'm about to do for you is not fair
I'm not answering questions for you that are not clear

What up to State Prop the crew, were they not there?
The moment that they heard it the verdict
When it was declared, ya boy had to sit a year
Did they really disappear, did Jay really not visit there?

Dame and Bean's are they tight as it seems
Or is it all fabricated from that same fabric
That ripped the Roc marriage straight from the scenes
Things ain't what it seems but in time do tell the truth shall prevail

Until then you dudes bite y'all nails in anticipation
Before I know you hate it
Why I got you waiting, I too am waiting
Gotta see a couple faces when I make them face it

Truth that is that your boy ain't have patience
As a matter of fact it's wearing thin
But I tell you this though when the new year begins
Pussy's ain't got nuts because I'm going all in

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

Now let's not get this misconstrued
To say that in this record I don't diss my dudes
Out of respect I couldn't check my once fist tight crew
Never in front of you, I couldn't get that rude

And I don't give a fuck but I couldn't get that cruel
It's knowing what I do I could get like, ooh
You wanna know what I do, don't ya?
Ya love it if I told you old fuckers, won't ya?

Uh, uh, scrap got to pay for this one
I'm sorry youngin', got to wait on this one
The Solution soon in stores
Date to be posted until then I'm on pause

Here's to DJ Khaled aka we the best
Beanie Sigel
(What? It ain't no more to it)
Give 'em more man, more

Well, fuck it I don't wanna stop
But you forgot the gunner pop, tell me who you wanna rock
It's crew love Rocafella 'til I die
Nigga keep it moving, don't get caught up in this drive-by

The breaks over, your boy about to take over
If that number one spot open, give it here
Give my ground, dust off my chair
And y'all niggas can kiss my ass before I sit it there

Back from the dead fresh off the prison tier
Daddy here to put the kids to bed
By the way the war's on you can't call it off
It's too late plus the boss involved

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

We are listening
Plead for attention
But it ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait

I'm the plot in every movie
Yet my theory stays the same
It ain't good if you don't wait
It ain't good if you don't wait, no

In life there's real niggas and there's fuck niggas
See we the best
I worked my whole life to show these niggas
DJ Khaled, Bennie Sigel, we the best

And all you fuck niggas, tryin' divide and conquer crews
Nigga we the realist, we the best
DJ Khaled, beatin' over Kane on this one
Thank you for taking time and listenin' to the real

Lenny S, what it does, nigga?
Gary, what it does? We the best
I'm starvin', I ain't never gonna stop
Beanie Mack, I see you on the solution
