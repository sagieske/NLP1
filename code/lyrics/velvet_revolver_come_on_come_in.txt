Song:

I am just a stranger
Might lead to just a little danger
Come child I'm gonna take ya
To a place inside of me that's aching
Always take ya to the limit
One fool hanging off a precipice
Come on it's the escalation
Come in feel the stimulation
I'm a man who's got his secrets
Keep it comin' yeah, keep it comin' yeah
I've beat the rest
Keep it comin' yeah, keep it comin' yeah

Yeah, now won't you, save me?
'Cause I have been through all the rest
Keep it comin', keep it comin' yeah

My mind has been a racing
Got somethin' inside of me that wakin'
Come girl come inside I know ya
There's a fire inside of ya that's growin'
Always took ya to the limit
One man falling off a precipice
Come on feel regeneration
Come in feel the elevation
I'm a man who's got his secrets
Keep it comin' yeah, keep it comin' yeah
I've beat the rest
Keep it comin' yeah, keep it comin' yeah

Yeah, now wont you, save me?
'Cause I have been through all the rest
Keep it comin', keep it comin'

I've gotta find a way, gotta find a way
Time is running late
I've gotta find a way, gotta find a way
I think my souls at stake
I've gotta find a way, gotta find a way

(Solo)

Keep it comin', keep it comin' yeah
Keep it comin', keep it comin' yeah

Yeah, now wont you, save me?
'Cause I have been through all the rest
Keep it comin' yeah, now keep it comin'

Yeah, now wont you, save me?
'Cause I have been through all the rest
Keep it comin' now, just keep it comin'

Yeah, now wont you, save me
'Cause I have been through all the rest
Keep it comin, Keep it comin' yeah
