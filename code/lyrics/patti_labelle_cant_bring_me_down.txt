Song:

Don't tell me you still love me
Don't make me feel this way
Don't tell me you're thinking of me
You know it's late to change

You were the one to leave
You said you did not love me
Now you're coming back right on track
Just like you always do

You can't bring me down
I have come too far this time around
You know I'll always love you

Can't bring me down
I have finally reached a higher ground
And you know I'll always love you

I know you don't mean to hurt me
Just can't make up your mind
You've got to understand me
I've wasted so much time

You are my shining light
I get that you are sacrificed
Now I'm moving on, it's time to be strong
There's better days ahead

You can't bring me down
I have come too far this time around
And you know I'll always love you

Can't bring me down
I have finally reached a higher ground
And you know I'll never forget you

Can't bring me down
No no no no

(Can't bring me down)
Can't bring me down
I have finally reached a higher ground
You know I'll always love you

(Can't bring me down)
I have come too far this time around
You know I'll always love you

Don't tell me you still love me
