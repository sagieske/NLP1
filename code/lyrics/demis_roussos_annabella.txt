Song:

When the stars begin to shine
The wind is flowing through my mind
Flocking waves the sea arise again
A vision calling from the sea
I see a clogging-up to me
I feel a strange force
Pulling me off of you

Annabella
Annabella it's you

And when we dance again
Up in the velvet sky
The moon is rise and high
We have to say goodbye

Ahhh yeah .....

The dawn is rising from the east
And seabirds call me back to be
Alone without your memories once more

The sand is warm beneath my feet
To stay again and I must live the time
The time I am forced to spent without you

Annabella
Annabella
Without you

And now you're gonna dream
I kissed and touched your hair
And that our love is shared
Before we say goodbye

Ahhh yeah

When the sun has gone to sleep
And seabirds rest their weary wings
Fairy nights with candle light and stars

Melt the skies, a deeper blue
I am here, but where are you ?
Can't you hear me calling you on the sea ?

Annabella
Annabella
Come to me
