Song:

La la la la, La la la la, La la la la, La la la
La la la la, La la la la, La la la la la

Eat, sleep, breathe it you're full of the stuff
Go bag it, tie it up tight
Wheat, meat, dairy-free, t-total, happy-clappy
High on life, you should try it, you know
Go on while no one's looking

Aha! Gotcha now!
Caught red handed in the biscuit tin
Cost you to keep me quiet

Golden boy boots, pocket pedal stool
Picking sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper separator
Busy bee wave, wave save the planet flag
But sneaky in suburbia

Aha! Candid camera!
Hook, line and sinker for the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet! (keep me quiet!)

Nicest, sweetest, up-most in everythingest
So charming, very charming
Well read, can play the fool
No one's I'll at ease and put their
Deepest Swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming

Aaaha! Aaaaaaha! Aaaaaaaaaaha!
You killed a man
Cost you to keep me quiet

Oi!
