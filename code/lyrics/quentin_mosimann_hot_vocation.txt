Song:

Hey boys, I've got a problem and you know it's, it's too easy
There are too many girls and it's too much hard, too much good, hot!
There are too many girls and it's too much hard, too much good, hot!

S** is my vocation, I can't fight these drugs
S** is my vocation and I can't struggle
S** is my vocation and I can't fight these drugs
And you know how, and you know what, this is my vocation like you

And my problem, I told you that something is very easy, I can't struggle!
Hey guys, it doesn't matter! It's just some pleasure so take her

S** is my vocation and I can't fight these drugs
And you know how, and you know what, this is my vocation like you

Ladies and gentlemen, on the turntables, mister John Revox!
For the voices and songs, mister John Louly, proper!
