Song:

Name me one thing that you have ever stayed true to besides the trends.
You change, you switch you go with the motherfucking seasons.
So tell me just why should I ever trust you
When I know you're not true. When I know just what friendship
Meant to you... Nothing

The cooler crowd walked on by you dropped me like a bad habit
So all your talk of brotherhood proves you're a lying sack of s**t
I think you've got things confused I'm not your f*****g latter
For you to gain some higher ground. Especially when good will
Isn't even abound.

Your f*****g tune, it's old as time
So don't feed me that bullshit line
I see our friendship. What's it for?
I'm cutting you off because I've seen friends like you before

You scum, you f**k, f*****g scum

Don't call yourself my friend
And then leave me in the dust
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?
Your intentions aren't true
What's wrong? What the fuck's wrong with you?
It's every f*****g thing you do
Don't sing to me
