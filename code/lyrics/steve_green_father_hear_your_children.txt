Song:

Father hear Your children call
Humbly at Your feet we fall
Prodigals confessing all

To the cross we bring our blame
All our life long sin and shame
And penitent, we breathe Your name
Penitent, we breathe Your name

By Your love, by Your grace
By the blood of Jesus wash our sins away
Make us new today and hear us as we pray

We're blind but pray for eyes to see
Where we're bound Lord, make us free
Stained, we plead for purity

Where we're sick, apply Your cure
Take our guilt and make us pure
For Your mercy Lord is sure
For Your mercy Lord is sure

By Your love, by Your grace
By the blood of Jesus wash our sins away
Make us new today and hear us as we pray

Lord, we have no other place to go
Only You can heal the wound of our soul
So let forgiveness flow, let forgiveness flow

Father hear Your children call
Humbly at Your feet we fall
Prodigals confessing all

To the cross we bring our blame
All our life long sin and shame
And penitent we breathe Your name
Penitent, we breathe Your name
Penitent, we breathe Your name

Father, hear Your children call
