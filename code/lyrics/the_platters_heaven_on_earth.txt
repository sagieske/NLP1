Song:

Heaven on earth
That's what you've made
For me since the day we met
Heaven on earth
It's all been so thrilling
I never can forget, uh-oh

Heaven on earth
Alone with an angel
Is living in dreams come true
Heaven on earth
I know that it happens only when I'm with you

Paradise seemed so far
Like a star, it twinkled high above me
Now I'm wise paradise
Isn't far at all when you're around to love me
Love me

Oh, heaven on earth
No need in waiting
Waiting until I die
Heaven on earth
That's what you've made
A heaven for you and I

A heaven for you and I
(For you and I)
