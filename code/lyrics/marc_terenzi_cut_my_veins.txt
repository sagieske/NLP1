Song:

You got the power
To make me feel good
Need every hour
The words you say cause

You let me see my whole world
I've never seen before

CHORUS:
Cut my veins
Open up my new way
I never felt the story
You
You give me more than i can say

Cut my veins
You helped me find a reason
It's the time to follow you
Cause you found a way to touch my soul
Cut my veins
Cut my veins

You light my fire
And let it always burn
No more desire
Yes that's the way of

You let me see my whole world
I've never seen before

Chorus

Cut my veins, cut my veins

Oh no

You let me see my whole world
I've never seen before

Cut my veins
Open up my new way

Chorus

Cut my veins
You helped me find a reason

Cut my veins, cut my veins
