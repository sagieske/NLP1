Song:

October, in the wind
November, in the skies
Winter is just around the corner
Wearing an old man’s disguise

His thoughts they are barren
His language is poor
Soon he’ll come knocking
At your door

Leaves shy from the trees
Geese fly to the moon
Winter is starving in shirt sleeves
Wrapping a can with his spool

His clothes they are ragged
His feet they are bare
But soon he will prosper
He’ll have his share

I can’t keep you from the rainfall
I can’t keep you from the snow
I can’t keep you warm in the storm
Where the wintry winds do blow

And I have no wools to bring you love
I have no cloak to share
And I only came to sing you love
A poem I wrote for your hair
