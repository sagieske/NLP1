Song:

Slow time, peak to all the hearing, blinded to the seeing, nothings so revealing
Somedays might leave here, I'll get what's comin' to me one day
These days my eyes are empty
Hard times for the son of a b***h

Self inflicted - I'm gonna fall flat
Unpredicted - That's where I'm at
So addicted - Dog tired in the fast lane

Break down, devistate to kneeling
Suffering to bleeding, all the chance of feeling
Someday I might destroy here
I'm gonna get what's coming to me one day
These days my life is empty
Hard times for the son of a b***h

Self inflicted - I'm gonna fall flat
Unpredicted - That's where I'm at
So addicted - Dog tired in the fast lane
