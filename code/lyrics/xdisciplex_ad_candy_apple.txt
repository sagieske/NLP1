Song:

Torn from the only thing
I know broken off struggling
To hold on burn me rip me tear me apart
Scalpel cuts and stabs digs in my lungs
My face piece by piece limb by limb
You refuse to listen today's society bends
And tears the truth misinformed public

Abides with closed eyes ignorance bleeds
Through my short sold life I was flesh
I was blood I had hands I had feet eyes
That would see no more supply but deny
Whose right to kill whose right to murder
My eyes begin to close open your eyes
