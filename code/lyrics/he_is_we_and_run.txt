Song:

Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh x4

Kinda wish I had the courage a bit of bravery so tired of waiting on a man to come and save me
Wishing I had everything or something really
Hard to admit it but now I'm thinking freely

I'm going to open my mind to all these
New found exciting possibilities

Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
I'm making all my own plans
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
Throwing my old one's away
Gotta grow up be someone
Draw a map, find a path take a breath and run
And run

Feeling my head with words to encourage me
Gotta get my act up straight so I can truly believe
That what I'm waiting for is really worth the wait
Stop bring myself down I gotta know what makes me great

I'm going to open my mind to all these
New found exciting possibilities

Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah
I'm making all my own plans
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah
Throwing all my old one's away
Gotta grow up be someone
Draw a map, find a path take a breath and run

I'm trying to get pass this being better than I want
Tired of waiting on someone else...
I'm trying to get pass this being better than I once was
Tired of waiting on someone else I can fix it by myself

Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh 0h
I'm finally taking a stand
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
I've learned from all my mistakes
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
I'm making all my own plans
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
Throwing all my old one's away
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
Gotta grow up be someone
Draw a map, find a path take a breath and run
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh
Run Run Run Run Run Run Run Run
Oh ah Oh ah Oh ah Oh Oh x3
