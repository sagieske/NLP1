Song:

Tell me how far you want this to go
I'm touching the places no one needs to know
I can feel your heart is beating fast
How can we make it last
Give it to me slowly
Give me your heart and soul
Give me your everything baby just let it go
When we make love forfeeling our fantasies
I can feel this is happening

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
I gave you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Tonight I gave you all my love
All my love

I can feel your body's shivering love so tasty
Baby when I'm holding you
Feel so good I can't resist those s*** lips
Baby when I'm kissing you
Give it to me slowly
Give me your heart and soul
Give me your everything baby just let it go
When we make love sharing our fantasies
I can't believe this is happening

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love

Baby don't stop just stay right there
Fast or slow only way to go
Baby take me there
I love the way you're holding me and the way that you're kissing me
Baby hold on, I'm about to give, give it all to you

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Tonight I gave you all my love

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
Tonight I'm giving you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Give you all my love

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love

All my love we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there?
Baby when we touch love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love

All my love
