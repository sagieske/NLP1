Song:

Joe lives with his folks at home
Smokes little plants he grows
Cool 4 a kids but 2day is the big 3 0
Got lost in habitual fiends
Now he is crying tears of
It seems all his hopes and dreams
What have could have been
He is saying why oh why does my life pass by

You shoulda said how
Could it have been that all this time saying why

30 candles you are blowin none of
The only music you'v been playin
Which deserve a light
Is the anthem of why
Always dreamin never doin so they
Never did take flight
Still the music that your playin

Is the anthem of why oh oh ohh
Suddenlly when she turned 15
Stacey dreamt of becoming a pop queen
Everything changed
She found out she had 1 on the way
So she, took all the posters of britney
Mariah, beyonce and whitney and
With her dreams

She threw them all away
She was saying why oh why if not 4 that night
You shoulda said how
Could it all this time saying why
So the song that you are singin
All the hopin all the wishin girl
You traded 4 a night
Is the anthem of why
Now your feelin all your dreamin
So the song that's your singin
Was just a waste of time
Is the anthem of why
Oh ohh oh
Always saying why oh why does my life pass by

Could it have been that all this time saying why
You shoulda said how

Know they should have never died
All the hopin all the prayin
But they faded when you traded how
4 the anthem of why
You gotta dream it gotta feel it if
Never sing it never play it
You ever wanna fly
Its the anthem of why
