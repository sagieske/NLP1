Song:

Your love's like a rope that ties
A ship down to the dock
Your love never seems to stop
And I've been sailing since you've been here
Your love's like a life line
That's been thrown to a drowning man
You just held out your hand
And you saved me, yes, you saved me

And everything's gonna be alright
Nothing left, but love's in sight
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Your love's like a waterfall
That goes flowing soft and free
Just look what you've done to me
I was falling, I was falling
Your love's like an autumn wind
That goes blowing 'cross the field
Your love always seems to build
It's gettin' stronger, it's gettin' stronger

And everything's gonna be alright
Nothing left, but love's in sight
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright

Everything's gonna be alright
Nothing left, but love's in sight
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright now (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be alright now (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be alright now (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be alright now (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be alright now
