Song:

You shoot me down in flames
You put me down a lot
I'm giving you my heart
Go on take it
Please be careful not to break it
Just remember it's the only one I've got
It's the only one I've
Chorus
Don't break my heart
You make me laugh a lot
And buy me silly things
And I'd rather be with you than anyone else
But if you make me mad
But if you make me mad
You'll wish that you had not
You'll wish that you had not
Chorus
Don't break my heart
Where are the roses and whispered silences
Where are the compliments and sleepless nights
It doesn't matter you see
I know your love
Basically never dies
Chorus
Don't break my heart
