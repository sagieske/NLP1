Song:

Little girl don't you understand
I wanna be your lovin' man
All by myself, all by myself
I don't need no-one to love you
Gonna love you all by myself

Well meet me in a hurry behind the barn
Don't be afraid I'll do you no harm
All by myself, all by myself
I don't need no-one to love you
Gonna love you all by myself

Well I got a girl who's six feet tall
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
All by myself, all by myself
I don't need no-one to love her
Gonna love her all by myself

Well I got a girl who lives on the hill
She won't love you but her sister will
All by herself, all by herself
I don't need no-one to love you
Gonna love you all by herself
