Song:

I've been making a mess of everything in my life
It all made sense in my head, now it just don't seem right
I've been pushing away all the ones that mean the most to me

I thought leaving that town would help me find who I am
But I'm trapped and I'm more lost than I've ever been
Everywhere that I turn, the devil tries to take me down

But I can't stop now, there's only one way out

And this road ain't easy, so don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
I fall to pieces, every time I see, you lose faith in me
You're the only reason I ever believed
So don't give up on me

There was a time when I believed I could do anything
Now I'm standing alone second guessing
But that's exactly what the enemy wants me to do
And I keep having this dream that I finally made it there
But it's not what I expected I'm waking up scared
I hear the thunder, but I do see the light, anymore

But I can't stop now and I won't let you down...

And this road ain't easy, so don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
I fall to pieces, every time I see, you lose faith in me
You're the only reason I ever believed
So don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Tonight's the revolution, I found my solutions
Nothings gonna poison my mind
If you stay by my side, I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright...

But this road ain't easy, so don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
I fall to pieces, every time I see, you lose faith in me
You're the only reason I ever believed
So don't give up on me

Don't give up on me
Mama don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Mama don't give up on me
