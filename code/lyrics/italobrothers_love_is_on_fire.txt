Song:

I can see us in your eyes
No need to think it twice
Like it was always meant to be
You and me
And there are times when every thing is a mess
But nothing is to confess
Like when two stars collide

Love is on fire
A burning heart
Because we have known it from the start
It was love at first sight
No matter of time
That I will make you mine

Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
That I will make you mine
Love is on fire! 

I got nothing more to miss
Never needed more than this
Just like a miracle
Sensational
And days will come when anything is wrong
But it keeps us going on
So come whatever may

Love is on fire
Tap-dah-de-doe... 
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
It was love at first sight, a matter of time
That I would make you mine

Love is on fire
A burning heart
Because we have known it from the start
It was love at first sight
No matter of time
Then I will make you mine

Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
That I would make you mine
Love is on fire

Love is on fire
A burning heart
Because we have known it from the start
It was love at first sight
No matter of time
That I will make you mine

Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
That I would make you mine
Love is on fire

Tap-dah-de-doe
Yeah! Tap-dah-de-doe
It was love at first sight, a matter of time
That I would make you mine
Love is on fire!
