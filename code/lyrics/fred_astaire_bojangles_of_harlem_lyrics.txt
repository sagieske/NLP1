Song:

Ask anyone up Harlem way
Who that guy Bojangles is
They may not know who's president
But ask 'em who Bojangles is

He's in the most entrancin' business
It's what they call the "Dancin' business"
When there's a beat, up on the street
Brother, you go and bet all your dough
Sister, you know that ain't no one but 'Bo'

Oh! Bojangles of Harlem, you dance such hot stuff
Young folks love you in Harlem, they say you've got stuff
Tough guys rumba out of poolrooms
And kids start truckin' out of schoolrooms

Oh! Bojangles of Harlem, the whole town's at your heels
Leaving their flats, missing their meals
Running like rats, going astray
Throw those long legs away
