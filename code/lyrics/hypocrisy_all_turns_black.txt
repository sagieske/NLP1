Song:

[Verse:]
I've been searching for the peace in my mind
It's nowhere to be found.
Your soul with me
Resting under my skin.

I see no point of living the life I lead
It hurts me too much.
Can you feel what I feel?

It must go deep.
My own soul is my enemy.

[Chorus:]
It seems like everything I do just drags us down.
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head.
I can't see the future, it all turns black.

[Verse 2:]
What's the point of being here
When this whole life is dragging me down?
Is this how we'll be?
I don't want to be part of it.

It must go deep.
My own soul is my enemy.

[Chorus:]
It seems like everything I do just drags us down.
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head.
I can't see the future, it all turns black.

[Verse 3:]
If there's another way
You can live another day
Then you'll know just when pressure's getting stronger.
I can hear voices calling my name
I guess they are over my head.

[Chorus:] x2
It seems like everything I do just drags us down.
It leaves an open scar that I know will never heal.
Broken promises now run through my head.
