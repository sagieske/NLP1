Song:

You put me under your skin
And I need you right now
Told me before you'd never put me down
But you lied to me
Now you're runnin' around
You got me under your skin
And I need you right now

Girl, please don't tease me
Girl, please don't tease me
Girl, please don't tease me

You got me under your skin
And I need you right now
Told me before you'll never put me down
But you lied to me
Now you're runnin' around
You got me under your skin
And I need you right now

Girl, please don't tease me
Girl, please don't tease me
Girl, please don't tease me

You got me under your skin
And I need you right now
You told me once before you'd never put me down
But you lied to me
Now you're runnin' around
You put me under your skin
And I need you right now

Girl, please don't tease me now
Girl, please don't tease me
Said leave me alone
