Song:

Come on over here, lay down next to me
Let me tell you something that I've been meaning to say for a long time, oohh
Baby it's been some time since we first met
And everyday with you is like no other

All this love you've given me
I know just what to do
I'll take this love you've given me
And give my love to you

You give your love so freely and you give it so abundantly
I just want to be able to give it back to you

Come on baby let me tell you tell you all the things I feel
Cause if it wasn't for your love, oh yeah
I don't think I would know what's real

All this love you've given me
I know just what to do
I'll take this love you've given me
And give my love to you

You got me singing
La la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
(Repeat)

All this love you've given me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you, oh oh
All this love you've given me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you, oh oh

All this love you've given me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you, oh oh
All this love you've given me
I wanna give, just let me give it back to you
