Song:

I can scratch the surface
And find out where you hide
I can find a reason
For all those holes inside
Covered in oppression
For all your wasted time
To wallow in depression
Just what you've left behind
Be... Hind

I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
That I can't hear you no more
I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
I can't take no more
I'll die
I'll die

Even though I hate you (Hate you)
I still love you anyway
I can not forsake you
And I can't run away
Now I try to stand up
Only to fall down
Fall down
(Oh God)
And now I try to shake you
But I just can't get you out
You out

I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
That I can't hear you no more
I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
I can't take no more
I'll die (I'll die)
I'm dieing

Someone fix me
Yeah
Fix me (Come on)
Fix me

Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
With you I feel I can't go on
I need you to breathe and I'm dying
So please won't you save me before I'm
Gone
Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
With you I feel I can't go on
I can't escape this hell I create
Why can't you look at my face?

I feel so ashamed
I'm falling, far away

Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
Ripping you up to show you, I'm right
Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
Ripping you up to show you, I'm right
Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
Ripping you up to show you, I'm right
Shut up and take the pain that I'm giving you
Ripping you up

I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
That I can't hear you no more
I'm deaf
I've circled far, God
I got no
I got no pride
I can't take no more
No pride
I can't take no more
No pride
I can't take
No more pride
I got no
I got no
No pride
No pride
No pride
No pride
