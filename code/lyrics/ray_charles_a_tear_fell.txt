Song:

A fool am I, a fool am I, in love
A tear fell when I saw you
In the arms of someone new
A tear fell when you left me
All alone and feeling blue
A tear fell when you told me
That your love was not for me
I didn't miss the teardrops,
But I missed you constantly
A fool am I, a fool am I, in love
The teardrops that you stepped on
As you danced across the floor.
Were crushed like my poor heart was
When you walked out of my door.
