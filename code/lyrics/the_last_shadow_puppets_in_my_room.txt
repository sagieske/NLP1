Song:

In my room she'll get to you
In my room she'll get to you
In my room

Could I turn on the light
Inpress unknown eyes
Humour absorbs the thoughts
Challenge emotionless thoughts
Seeing things with a second glance
As she turns through her magazines

In my room she'll get to you
In my room she'll get to you
In my room

Could I turn on the light
Inpress unknown eyes
Humour absorbs the thoughts
Lift up your sorted heads
Played like dancing fools
Turning the tension round
Building up silent sounds

Just another day
Oh in my room
Shruck out like before
Oh in my room
Room
Room
Room
Room
