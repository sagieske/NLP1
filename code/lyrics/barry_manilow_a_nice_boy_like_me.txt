Song:

Walkin' around uptight
And lookin' for noise
Frantic on a friday night
Just one of the boys
Phoney defenses, they fall in my way
A case of hot fire turnin' to stone
Just a wind up poet with a chip on his shoulder
Meetin' saturday mornin' alone

What's a nice boy like me
Doin' in a place that never closes?
I can hardly hear ya'
Holy moses Lookin' so sad
What's a nice boy like me
Doin' by the dance floor after hours?
Dozin' over rows of whiskey sours?

Feelin' so bad I'm feelin so bad for me
(What' cha doin' here boy?)

Lost in the crowd alone
I'm drinkin' my third
I'm hungry for company,
But I can't think of the words
Watchin' the girls, my heart in my hands
What a misplaced, pitiful sight!
Just a stiff upper lip who'll be knowin' tomorrow
What he shoulda' been sayin' tonight!

Wontcha' tell me what's a nice boy like me
