Song:

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away

Sometimes some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run
But now I truly realise
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well I saw them with my own eyes spreading those lies
And well I don't wanna live a lie, too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away

Well I'm so tired baby
Things you say you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room baby
Don't listen to the games they play
Girl I thought you'd realise
I'm not like them other guys
Coz I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise
And well I don't wanna live a lie, too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights, I'm sorry to say lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away oh to find a better day
I'm walking away
