Song:

Doo doo doo doo
More than a woman
Doo doo doo doo
Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
(But now you take my breath away).
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You've got me working day and night
(Just trying to keep a hold on you).
Refrain 1:
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die.
Bridge:
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time.
Chorus:
Oh...
(More than a woman)
(More than a woman to me), baby
(More than a woman), more than a woman
More than a woman to me.
Doo doo doo doo
More than a woman
Doo doo doo doo
Oh, girl, there are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
(Let history repeat itself).
Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
(I'd fall in love with you again).
Refrain 2:
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love now I think I would die.
(Repeat Bridge & Chorus)
Doo doo doo doo
More than a woman
Doo doo doo doo
Chorus 2:
Oh...
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me), yes you are, baby
(More than a woman), more than a woman
More than a woman to me.
(Doo doo doo doo), hooh, baby
(More than a woman)
(Doo doo doo doo), Oh... yeah, yeah, yeah
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me)
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me), everyday of my life
(More than a woman), oh, baby
(More than a woman to me)
(More than a woman), more than a woman
(More than a woman to me)
