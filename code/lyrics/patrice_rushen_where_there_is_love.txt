Song:

I'm on some desert isle
Searching for, the love you gave me
Looking deep inside, for the treasures that I found
The gold reminds of time, all the secrets of our hearts
It's always what you find, that makes it hard for you to part

Where there is love
You'll always find somebody
And where there is you
Somebody will find love
Where there is love
You'll never have to worry
Where there is you, there always be room in my heart

I'm holding in my hand
All the gifts of love you gave me
But the wind will fall away like a tiny grain of sand
The rising of sun begins the day of our learning
Love will never end our hearts forever yearning

Where there is love
You'll always find somebody
And where there is you
Somebody will find love
Where there is love
You'll never have to worry
Cause where there is you, you'll find love in a hurry

Where there is love
You'll always find somebody
And where there is you
Somebody will find love
Where there is love
You'll never have to worry
Cause where there is you, you'll find love in a hurry
