Song:

Like the legendary Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force of love beginning

Oh we come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

I'm up all night to the sun
He's up all night to get some
I'm up all night for good fun
He's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

The present has no ribbon
Your gifts keeps on giving
What is this I'm feelin'
If you wanna leave I'm ready, oh
Cause we come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

I'm up all night to the sun
He's up all night to get some
I'm up all night for good fun
He's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

Oh we come too far

Oh we come too far

Oh we come too far

Oh we come too far
To give up
Who we are
Who we are

I'm up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
He's up all night for good fun
He's up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky
