Song:

I get excited at you all right!
I wanna go for a midnight drive
We'll keep running in the moonlight
I wanna take a crazy drive

The condition of my car is perfect
Hey! Do not get off my car yet
Are you ready now? I'll take you to the paradise
So sit down next to me all the time
Let's enjoy with me It's playtime
Are you ready now? Start running!

[Chorus:]
I do not wanna be separated from you
'Cause since that day, I love you
It's my true feeling so
"I wanna bash out all night long!"
Please do not leave me alone, I wanna stay with you
'Cause since that day, I love you
It's my true feeling so
"I wanna bash out all night long!"
Oh, Yeah!

I'm crazy about you all right!
I wanna take a midnight flight
We'll keep flying in the moonlight
I wanna spend a crazy night

My body and heart are so perfect
Hey! Don't get out of my plane yet
Are you ready now? I'll take you to the heaven
So sit down next to me all the time
Let's enjoy with me It's playtime
Are you ready now? Start flying!

[Chorus 2:]
I've met you and I am luckier day by day
How do you feel? How do you think?
I wanna know your answers
"We wanna bash out all night long!"
You'll never reveal your real intent today
How do you feel? How do you think?
I wanna know your answers
"We wanna bash out all night long!"
Oh, Yeah!

[Chorus:]

[Chorus 2:]
