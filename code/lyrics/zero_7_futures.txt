Song:

Made a note of it
Did you write it on your hand
Put a name on it
To help you understand

Well do you see
The futures holidays are for me
Just let me know
Where we go after the fall

Like the sound of it
Gonna hang it on your wall
Turn and run with it
For the sake of one and all
Where you go, nobody knows

Well do you see
The futures holidays are for me
Just let me know
Where to go
Where you go after the fall
