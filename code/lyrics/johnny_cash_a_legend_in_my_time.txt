Song:

If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game,
I'd be a legend in my time.
If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets,
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
For hearts that are broken for love that's in vain.

If loneliness meant world acclaim,
Everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time.
