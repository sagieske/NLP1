Song:

I hate to leave you babe
I just can't waste my time
You got this jealous husband
I'm too too young to die
I gotta move on away from round here
Just before the bullets fly

Always been a gambler
Taking chances all of my life
Busting up love affairs
Just like shoot dice
I staged the game girl
That's what keeps me satified
And I can leave it in the nick of time
Just before the bullets fly

I lost my first bet when I was twenty-one
Found myself in New Orleans
On the wrong end of a gun
The stakes keep getting higher
But somehow I survive
By knowing when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly

I'm knowing when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly, yeah
I'm knowing when the need becomes
Just before the bullets fly
