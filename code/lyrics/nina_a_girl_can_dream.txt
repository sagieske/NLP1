Song:

When I was a child the story would say
Somebody will sweep you off your feet some day
That's what I hoped would happen with you
More than you could know

I wanted to tell you that my heart's in your hands
I prayed for the day that I would get the chance
And just when I worked up the courage to try
Much to my surprise

You had somebody else
These feelings I keep to myself

I may never get to hold you so tight
I may never get to kiss you goodnight
I may never get to look deep in your eyes
Or so it seems
I always will be wishing you were mine
I'll think about what could be all the time
All the happiness that I could find
Baby, a girl can dream

From the moment I wake up till I fall asleep
I imaging you're not with her but with me
Talking and laughing sharing our dreams
But it's just a fantasy

Cause you have somebody else
These feelings i keep to myself

...A girl can dream it's true
And to call you my own
It's the sweetest dream I know
