Song:

Dear Santa
I wrote you a letter
I wonder if you ever read it
I've only one wish that I ask you
It's the same old thing
As every other year
Ooo oooo Oooo

This year I can't say I've been perfect
I'm pretty sure I've got a regret or two
But Santa please don't hold it against me
Cause this time I'm counting on you...

To bring me
Bring me
Love
Ohhh
Santa, bring me
Bring me love whoa
Bring me love
Ohhh Ooooo
Bring me love
Ohhhh
Ooooo

As a child I remember dreaming
Of all the beautiful things that you can create
But I can have all the toys in the world then
You'd see it still wouldn't mean a thing

Can you
Bring me
Bring me
Love
Ohhh
Santa, bring me
Bring me love whoa
Bring me love
Ohhh Ooooo
Bring me love
Ohhhh
Ooooo

Cause I've been (I've been)
Patient (patient)
I've been (I've been)
Waiting so long
Hoping (hoping)
Praying (praying)
Just tell me that you heard me just this once

Can you bring me
Bring me
Love
Ohhh
Santa, bring me
Bring me love whoa
Tell me the time has come
That there is someone waiting for me too
So Santa bring me
Bring me love
Whoa
Bring me Love
Ohh oooo
Bring me love
Oh oooo
