Song:

'Ll go my way by myself
Here's how that comedy ends
I have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friends.

With clouds in the sky above
Have put the blocks on my fun
I'll try to fly up above
For my place in the sun.

I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one know that I denied myself

I found myself alone.

--- Instrumental ---

I'll face the unknown
I'll build the world of my own
No one know that I denied myself
I found myself alone.

I'll go my way by myself
Here's how that comedy ends
I have to deny myself
Love and laughter and friends...
