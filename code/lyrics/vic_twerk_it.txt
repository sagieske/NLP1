Song:

Lil' Mamma gotta a** so fat
I ain't never seen it twerk like that
So when she turn around and work it
Back it up and dump it
Ask her who she twerkin' for like that

She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy
She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy
She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy
She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy

Go Go

Clap it up, clap it up
It's a celebration
Shawty layin' on the money man
I think she played all kinda girls
Black, Puerto Rican, Asian
White Girl fat a** look so amazin'

Rack it up, ra ra rack it up
Turn around and let me see ya
Ba ba back it up
Shawty bouncin' in the club, nba with it
Pop one two cheecks
Shawty bangin' it

Ayyyyy
Shawty gotta a** like a mothaf-cka
If she throw it at me, Imma hit the mothaf-cka
I got hands but my plans is to never cuff 'em
But we start twerkin', sista workin' out this mothaf-cka

Lil' mamma gotta a** so fat
I ain't never seen it twerk like that
So when she turn around and work it
Back it up and dump it
Ask her who she twerkin' for like that

She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy
She say she twerkin' it for daddy
Twerk-twerkin' it for daddy

You see them grey clouds, that's the real kush
And that pole you bouncin' on, that's the real wood
Now drop drop, drop it on the floor

I like a real hood b***h that can wobble for the dough
Shaped like a coke bottle, I'll swallow that coke, yep

I got hands but my plans is to never cuff 'em
But we start twerkin', sista workin' out this mothaf-cka
