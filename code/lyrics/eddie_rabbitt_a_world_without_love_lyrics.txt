Song:

Turn the TV on
'Cause all I see are worlds exploding all around me
Hey Joe, won't you buy a drink
For the lonely faces that I see

No, I'm not lookin' to fall
In love for a minute
I want someone who'll put
Their whole heart in it

No I won't give in
'Cause I can't live in
A world without love

Now I look into the mirror
And could that guy be me
'Cause I don't seem to recognize
The face I see

And the nights get longer
When you're on your own
And there's not one friendly face in the crowd
Who'll take me home
Take me home

I read the headlines
And another place
Just became history
And just like me
There's a million souls
Wandering aimlessly

Now we all have to deal
With insecurity
But maybe if I reach out
Someone will reach out to me

No I won't give in
'Cause I can't live in
A world without love

Now I look into the mirror
And could that guy be me
'Cause I don't seem to recognize
The face I see

And the nights get longer
When you're on your own
And there's not one friendly face in the crowd
Who'll take me home
Take me home

No I won't give in
'Cause I can't live in
A world without love

Without love
Love
