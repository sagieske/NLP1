Song:

(break)

Blue railroad train, I'm goin' down the railroad track
It makes me feel so doggone blue to listen to that old smokestack

Drivers a-rollin' on, leavin' me here behind
Give me back them good old days and let me ramble down the line

(break)

Blue railroad train, leavin' me here alone
You treatn' me good, you treat'n me bad, you're makin' me think of home

I hear that lonesome train and love to hear the whistle blow
She's takin' the sun and leavin' the rain and makin' me wanna go

(break)

I've got the blues, longin' for her company
It's many miles from where I am to the only one for me

It's so lonesome here, waitin' for the manifest
I hope that engineer is kind, enough to let me be his guest

(break)

Blue railroad train, a good old pal to me
Takes me everywhere I wanna go, get my transportation free
