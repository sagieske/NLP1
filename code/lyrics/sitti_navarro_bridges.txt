Song:

(first part: lyrics not in english)
I have crossed a thousand bridges
In my search for something real
There were great suspension bridges
Made of spiderwebs of steel

There were tiny wooden trestles
And there were bridges made of stone
I have always been a stranger
And I've always been alone

There's a bridge to tomorrow
There's a bridge from the past
There's a bridge made of sorrow(?)
That I pray would not last There's a bridge made of colors

In the sky high above
And I'm certain that somewhere
There's a Bridge made of love
Lalala...
(repeat from 1st and 2nd stanza)
