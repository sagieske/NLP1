Song:

If we are destined not to meet again
Let me hold your hand
So you would understand
And if this will be our last time
Look into my eyes before it's time to...

If we are destined not to meet again
Let me hold your hand
So you would understand
And if this will be our last time
Look into my eyes before it's time to say goodbye
Baby hold my hand
Come feel and savor our romance

Let me take you back to that place
Place where we first had our dance
If moments we've shared
Faded to the past
And all the love that we've had
Just can't last

If this will be the last time
Let me say I love you

For the last time
Until we meet again
The time has come for us for the end
Though I can't have you in my life
But I'll just be an angel watching over you
From a distant sight

For the last time
Let me say I love you
For one last time
Just one last time
