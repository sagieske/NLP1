Song:

Shiny, have you seen my world in new colours?
How you fire from a rocket in the universe?
I'm up on the sky and the dream's so blue
I live in the sky
You come live here too
I'm queen of the clouds
Make my wish come true
I sing to the night
Let me sing to you

Oh, baby, listen please
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love

Baby don't you see
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love
You're high enough for me

Light brighter, pick the biggest stars of mine
And I'm trip, trip, tripping in my empire state of mine

I'm up on the sky and the dream's so blue
I live in the sky
You come live here too
I'm queen of the clouds
Make my wish come true
I sing to the night
Let me sing to you

Oh, baby, listen please
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love

Baby don't you see
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love
You're high enough for me

You're high enough for me
Baby, listen please
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love

Baby don't you see
I'm not on drugs
I'm not on drugs
I'm just in love
You're high enough for me
You're high enough for me
