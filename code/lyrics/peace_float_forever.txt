Song:

Sit atop the Eiffel in your mind
If you're not happy wearing denim, you're a devil in disguise
Useless you're so useless you're so blind
If there's dew drops in the darkness
They're hiding from you're eyes

Hold on to your headlights
They hold your skin to your bones
Fold in fear of the white lines
You know we'll float forever
You know we'll float forever in the tide

Swim down through the fathoms of your soul
If you don't try and get your feet wet
You're a liar and a troll
Etchings, thousands, etchings of your eyes
If you don't climb atop the Eiffel
You'll never fall or die

Hold on to your headlights
They hold your skin to your bones
Fold in fear of the white lines
You know we'll float forever
You know we'll float forever in the tide
