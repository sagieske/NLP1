Song:

I thought that I would die
My guy just said goodbye to me
Nothing that I could do
I was so blue

I lost my tender feelings
Asking heaven why - why me
The prison of love won't let me go, oh no
My feet were slowly losing ground
I felt hopeless, sad and down
But then I met you

Chorus

And I'm in love again - dudududududu
No reason to pretend
I'm still down and blue
I'm in love again - dudududududu
While looking for a friend
I lost my heart to you


My wounded heart was bleeding
I didn't want to fall for you
I now what I feel for you is true
So true

I don't know how it happened
Good to know that you are here
Baby I'm for real, sincere
Not it's clear
My heart is slowly gaining ground
Forgotten feelings I have found
Back there in your arms

Chorus

And I'm in love again - dudududududu
No reason to pretend
That I'm still down and blue
'coz I'm in love again - dudududududu
While looking for a friend
I lost my heart to you
I can't believe it's true - dudududududu
Untried unknown unplanned,
But I'm in love again
Yeah I'm in love again

My heart is slowly gaining ground
Forgotten feelings I have found
Back there in your arms
