Song:

Another day goes by
And I don't understand or know the reasons why
I'm looking for a change in life
But another day goes by

Here we go again

It's today
I wish it was tomorrow though I think I'd say
Ya know I think it feels just like yesterday
So lately I've been looking for a change
But the more things change
The more they seem to stay the same
Here we go again

It's a new day
It's almost like tomorrow never came
Same ole thing same ole game different name
And everyday I sing the same ole song
And today I don't feel like waking up
But the show must go on and on and on

Another day goes by
And I don't understand and I don't pretend to try
I wanna change my life
But another day goes by

Just when I get it right another day goes by

Here we go again

So many days gone by
I still don't understand but now I realize
I'm gonna change my life that's right
While the days go by
I'm gonna change my life that's right
While the days go by
I wanna change my life
But another day go by
