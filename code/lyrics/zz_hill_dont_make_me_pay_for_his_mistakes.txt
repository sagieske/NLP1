Song:

Don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong
Yes, don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong

Well, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one who tried to
Give them a home, yes, I am

I said I'm tired of you telling me, baby
About how your man did you wrong
How he used to take your welfare check
And leave the kids without home

But I'm the one who's working
I'm the one trying to give them a home
Yes, you know I'm the one
Who's gonna love you, baby
I'm the one who's gonna give them a home
Oh, yes, I am

I said I don't understand
What make a good woman treat a man so bad
She take a no good man
And give him everything she had

She'll reach back in the cookie jar
And give him every dime
And let the kids run around hungry
Sleeping and a crying

So don't let make me pay for his mistakes, baby
He's the one who did you wrong
Yes, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one who gonna give them a home
Oh, yes, I am

Yes, he's the one who gave you six babies
And I'm the one trying to give them a home

Hold on
Don't make me pay, baby
Don't make me pay for his mistakes, baby

He's the one who did you wrong
Lord, baby
He's the one
Can't you hear me begging you, baby
