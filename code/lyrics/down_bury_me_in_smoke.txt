Song:

Windows are closing
Keep me locked away
No chance was given
To find myself today
My time of aging
Wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come
I know the reason why

I have to risk it
Alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have to use it
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke

Under the world
I wait for my fate
My soul resting
Beneath my blissful haze
My time of aging
Wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come
I know the reason why

I have to risk it
Alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have to use it
To keep me satisfied until I'm gone
Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke
