Song:

Great moments they pass by
If you're careless
Desperately trying to speak the words
I've been wanting to say for a long time.
Tongue tied, every time I try to talk to you
In time, I'll find the right line.

Caught a glimpse of you
I tremble every time you walk by
Hopelessly trying to find a way
To be near you, to get near you.
In my mind, plays thoughts of you all the time
I'll find the right line.

I'll bleed for you
Like a new tattoo in my heart
You'll stay permanent.

Am I too late now?
Will I find a way to get to you somehow?
She's breaking me down again
She's breaking me down.
She's breaking me down again.

I'll bleed for you
Like a new tattoo in my heart
You'll stay permanent.

I'll bleed for you
Like a new tattoo in my heart
You'll stay permanent.
Permanent.
Permanent.
Permanent.
