Song:

Decisions, decisions
My minds blowing into your screen
Television disrupting the sound of the tears
In the kitchen where my mom first threw a knife at me
Mom I said I was sorry
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts.
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away?

Suck it up kid
You're about to die anyway
Your dad's wasted
Your mom's on crack
Your brother's g**.
Never mind that
Take A. 22 to your mouth
And blow your brains out
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts.
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away?

I'm drowning here
To seal the flame
We're happy
I will see you all in hell
I can't stop there
To say, again
The reason we're blown away

Away....
Away.....
Awayyyyy......

Decisions, decisions
My mind's blowing into the screen
Television disrupting the sound of the tears
Never mind
Take A. 22 to your mouth
And blow your brains out
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away?
