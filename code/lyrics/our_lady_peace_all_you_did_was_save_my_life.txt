Song:

You, looked at me as you walked in the room
Like the red sea, you split me open
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen
All you did was save my life
Tried to run but I couldnt move
Well I paid for these concreat shoes
Like a singer that sings the blues
You saw hope in the hopeless
I'm not dying
All you did was save my life
Pulled me out of that flat line
Put the heartbeat back inside
I'm not dying
All you did was get me through, I owe every breathe to you
Heart and soul unparalyzed, all you did was save my life
Save my life
I'm not for sale but I've been sold
The more I hear the less I know
The lies are swallowed whole
In there insignificance
The storys been told a million times, but it's different when it's your life
I won the lottery tonight, the lottery tonight
I'm not dying
All you did was save my life
Pulled me out of that flat line
Put the heartbeat back inside
I'm not dying
All you did was get me through, I owe every breathe to you
Heart and soul unparalyzed, all you did was save my life
Save my life
I started to come around, the dogs are backing down
I'm not afriad to see, the devil's gone underground
This tightropes been cut down, and I can finally breathe
You, looked at me as I walked in the room
Like the red sea you split me open
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen
I'm not dying
All you did was save my life
Pulled me out of that flat line, put the heart beat back inside
I'm not dying
All you did was get me through, I owe every breathe to you
Heart and soul unparalyzed, all you did was save my life
All you did was save my life
Put the heart beat back inside
All you did was save my life
Put the heart beat back inside
All you did was save my life
