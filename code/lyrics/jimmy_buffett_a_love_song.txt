Song:

"Okay"
I really do appreciate the fact youre sittin here
Your voice sounds so wonderful
But yer face don't look too clear
Bar maid bring a pitcher, another round o brew
"alright lets here it"
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)
"youre on the record!"
Chorus:
Why don't we get drunk and s***w
I just bought a water bed, its filled up for me and you
They say you are a snuff queen
Honey I don't think that's true
So, why don't we get drunk and s***w.
"i can't wait for em to put that label on my live album. Youre sounding absolutely wonderful out there, but we have invited the all girls choir from lima, ohio down here and we can't here
Too well now. Wed like all of you gentlemen out in the audience to just sorta take a break, sit back and lets let these beautiful women of the nineties tell us how they feel about it. Ladies
Ou ready? On the count of four. One, two, three, four. "
Chorus:
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)
"whoo yeah!"
I just bought a waterbed its filled up with elmers glue. "
They say you are a snuff queen
Lets see what all you macho men can do
Why (don't we get drunk and screw)
"oh yeah."
Why don't we get drunk and s***w
"i think we better work this out amongst ourselves."
Why don't we get drunk and s***w, oooh yeah
