Believe in Myself

When I'm alone in my chair, I just go about wishing
I wanna be strong, I really want to be trusted
When all alone in my bed, I just go about yearning
I wanna be cool, I also want to be like you

But that's not something I do so easily
This is not simply my way, my style
Gotta get a hold on my life

I wanna fly high so I can reach the highest of all the heavens
Somebody will be waiting for me so I have gotta fly higher
Gotta keep going everything is a great new challenge for me
I will believe in myself
This is the only start for me

When I'm alone in my sleep, I just go about dreaming
I see myself there, having the same adventure

If I just follow you, I will never see the light
Now's the time to find my way through this life
I'm trying so hard to be strong

I wanna fly high so I can reach the highest of all the heavens
Somebody will be waiting for me so I have gotta fly higher
Gotta keep going everything is a great new challenge for me
I will believe in myself
This is the only start for me
