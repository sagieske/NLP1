Song:

You are always in my heart
Everyday and every hour
But we're apart
I'm crazy about your love from sunrise

And I could only close my eyes
And think about the days and nights
When we're together
When we shared all the laughter
And shed all the tears of goodbye

*If I could run
If I could ride
If I could fly
If I could be right where you are
Just to hold you
And to feel your sweet surrender
If I could run
If I could ride
If I could fly
If I could be right where you are
And I could be with you one more time

And I could only close my eyes
And think about the days and nights
When were together
When we shard all the laughter
And shed all the tears of goodbye

Repeat *

I'd stretch the world
That you might see
Your love was all that meant to me

Repeat*

... Then I could be with you one more time
