Song:

Where do we go from failure?
There's no way but up from here.
Your morals can't help me now.
This time, there's no room for dissonance.
Why do we ask what we already know?
Just to know that something is real.
What if things change? When and why?
Who's first? Who's left behind?
It's nice to know when something is real.
Where do we go from failure?
There's no way but up from here.
This time, there's no room for dissonance.
You are only worth what your heart is willing
So tell me, are you willing?
This lesson's learned, to have retrospect
And "see'est la vie" I can't accept.
It's safe to say, your valor was more of a pose.
It is safe to say what was said,
Was meant to be said.
What if things change?
When and why?
Who goes first?
Who's left behind?
See'est la vie won't change a thing.
