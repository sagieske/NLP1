Song:

Well you walked into my heart like it was some old dance hall floor
I should have known better I had seen your kind before
you rolled in like a tumble weed the texas wind had blown
and i feel another heartache coming on

Theres no doubt about it darlin you're the hurtin kind
like all those other memories branded on my mind
I fell right into this one you were coming on so strong
and I feel another heartache comin on

well its a shame you couldnt keep those promises you made to me
tellin me you would never do me wrong
another lesson I will learn
anohter bridge that I will burn
you're just another heartache comin on

well I guess I'll learn the hard way darlin love is just a curse
theres no sense in crying it will only make it worse
so we'll go on our seperate ways and I'll be fine alone
until I feel another heartache comin on
until another heartache comes along
