Song:

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Watching for the signals that some easily
Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are
Every step a step to set you free

All for the sake and the calling of light
Ask as you give, as you measure in time

All in all this will to give, this sacrament,
This need to live
Take it a step to bring love easily
All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young,
You shall be free
Waiting for the waiting to be free

Talk is the easy send, everyone heard
Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can

This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting
This day is of a special way of love relating
This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to make
You
Wonder
How did heaven begin?
This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it,
When you see, you get it

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Take it as it comes so easily

We'll be there beside the sign, this wherewithal, this will to be,
Brining all the love that's meant to be
All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there
All in all this time is meant to be
