Song:

Days have passed
And still no sign of us
Not a hint of what used to be
When you lived in that part of me
This blinding silence
Lives in every room
Of what once was a happy home
Now we're sitting here all alone
Could this be that it was all a lie
And we're afraid to say good-bye

Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
And the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thougth of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
And the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thougth of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Could this be that it was all a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
And the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thougth of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Days have passed and still no sign of us
Not a hint of what used to be
When you lived in that part of me
