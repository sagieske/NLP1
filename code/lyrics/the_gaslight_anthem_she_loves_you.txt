Song:

On President Street
You'll find the sisters
Praying over
My city's heart
While Union avenue
Turns to it's disciple
Who feels the pressure heat coming on hard

Chorus;
And if all was well
And your heart could find the words
Would we for better baby
Would we be for worse
And if there was a way
To navigate your seas
If Tonight my true love
Dared belong to me

And Juliet she's smoking by the window
Saying stone cold
'i believe in you, Romeo'
And the raindrops and the cars
Keep on falling from off the bars
Blocking out a good song
Playing on the radio

Chorus

I've been down
I've been out
Had my head and my heart kicked around

I've been down
I've been out
Had my head and my heart kicked around

But in quiet of the night
Romeo's mind is burning
From putting all of his blood
Into them sermons

Chorus

Do you miss her right now
(Dared belong to me)
Do you miss her right now
(Dared belong to me)
Do you miss her right now
(Dared belong to me)
