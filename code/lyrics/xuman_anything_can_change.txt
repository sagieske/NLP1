Song:

I'm on the run
This is the crown
I made it myself
And everything can change so slow
A perfect ending
We can't deny
What's done is right
There's none to declare
And everything can change so slow
A perfect ending

Uuuuu

There's none can decide
What you can get through
So I'll be your guide
Out of the blue
