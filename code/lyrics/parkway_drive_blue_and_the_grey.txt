Song:

Dear sky, 
Dear sky, don't cry for me. Be the hope I could never reach.
Cold sea, please don't let me sink.
Wrap your arms around me and carry me home.

I stood at the shore and spoke to the ocean.
I stood in the water and let my guts spill.
I said, "You and me, we're not so different. I see my reflection in all that you do."

We both keep our secrets, 
We're both, oh, so blue.
My heart is full of darkness, 
I know that yours is too.

I sat on the rooftop and screamed at the sky
I sat on the edge until I knew deep inside:
Like the sky, I will always be empty.
The horizon, my love, forever just out of reach.

We both keep our secrets, 
We're both, oh, so blue.
My heart is full of darkness, 
I know that yours is too.

Distance was born when the sea and sky grew apart.
Loneliness was born the day I let you go.
I let you go.

So now I stand at the shore and speak to the ocean, 
I stand in the water and let my guts spill.

We both keep our secrets, 
We're both, oh, so blue.
My heart is full of darkness, 
I know that yours is too.

Dear sky, 
Dear sky, don't cry for me. Be the hope I could never reach.
Cold sea, please don't let me sink.
Wrap your arms around me and carry me home.

Dear sky.
