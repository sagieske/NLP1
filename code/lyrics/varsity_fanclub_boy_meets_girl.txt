Song:

Ohhh ohh ohh wee oh
When boy meets girl
Ohhh ohh ohh wee oh
When boy meets girl

[Verse 1:]
See when I saw this pretty young thing
She was hangin with her girls
She was sippin a slurpee
Brown eyes that caught me off guard
So I walked up to her friend (her friend)
Said I would like to meet
Take her out to eat
And sweep her off her feet
Can you arrange it please?
And she said (she said), 
When you wanna meet her, meet her?

[Chorus:]
When boy meets girl
You can stay up til the morning, never gets boring.
When boy meets girl
You can spend all night kissin, lovin each minute.
When boy meets girl
Something inside of you just changes.
When boy meets girl
When boy meets girl

[Verse 2:]
Hangin out at one of her friend's cribs
Watchin the sun come up, there's no sleepin
Holdin hands on top of the roof
(She said) With you I think I found a good thing.
We're having lots of fun, 
She takes a piece of gum, 
And puts it on her tongue
Said can you kiss me please?
And I said, I'm really glad I met ya, met ya.

[Chorus:]
When boy meets girl
You can stay up til the morning, never gets boring.
When boy meets girl
You can spend all night kissin, lovin each minute.
When boy meets girl
Something inside of you just changes.
When boy meets girl
When boy meets girl

[Hook:]
Ohhh, oh you can stay up (you can stay up)
When boy meets girl
Ohhh, oh you can stay up (you can stay up)
When boy meets girl

You can talk all night and be yourself
Don't have to hide those feelings that you felt
Checking your inbox when you get home
You send a good night text on the phone (when boy meets girl)

[Chorus:]
When boy meets girl
You can stay up til the morning, never gets boring.
When boy meets girl
You can spend all night kissin, lovin each minute.
When boy meets girl
Something inside of you just changes.
When boy meets girl
When boy meets girl

When boy meets girl
You can stay up til the morning, never gets boring.
When boy meets girl
You can spend all night kissin, lovin each minute.
When boy meets girl
Something inside of you just changes.
When boy meets girl
When boy meets girl

Ohhh ohh ohh wee oh (yeah)
When boy meets girl
Ohhh ohh ohh wee oh (ooo)
When boy meets girl
