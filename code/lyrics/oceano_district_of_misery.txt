Song:

We are the antidote and also the disease
We're the oppressors who posses marks of the beast.
Mankind deserves this
A catalyst for deconstruction.
A scapegoat to hold humanity on it's knees
A self-inflicted social anarchy to frighten the population into submission. Intricate color schemes on tv hypnotize them while they sleep, and from behind the scenes inject a fatal dose of misery.
So let these structures fall
As buildings crumble, watch this metropolis transform to ruins.
We have no sympathy
Victims lungs overflown with debris, their fractured bones exposed, lacerated is their skin
This is a demonstration in the clout of government: Failure to conform equals destruction
At the end of this world we hold all the answers. At the end of this world you'll posses only misery
