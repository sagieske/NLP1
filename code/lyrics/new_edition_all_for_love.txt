Song:

The girl next door has taste and style
SheЎЇs lookinЎЇ so much better to me, yeah
Her flavor is hot as she passes by
Now I want her so much that it makes me scream, yeah

Our eyes collide, couldnЎЇt turn away
She licked her lips and smiled at me
When we find ourselves a little hideaway
I knew that I was in for somethinЎЇ sweet

All for love
IЎЇm doinЎЇ things iЎЇve never done before
All for love
IЎЇll try my best Ў®cause sheЎЇs the one my heart beats for

We hold each other Ў®neath the starry skies
I feel the rhythm of our hearts
This is harder than the 4th of july
And I want more of what sheЎЇs got

I tell her things I always keep inside
I let her look into my soul
She says she loves me, can I squeeze her tight
Tonight there ainЎЇt no letting go

All for love
IЎЇm doinЎЇ things iЎЇve never done before
All for love
IЎЇll try my best Ў®cause sheЎЇs the one my heart beats for

In a daze all time
Dreaming about her day and night

All for love
IЎЇm doinЎЇ things iЎЇve never done before
All for love
IЎЇll try my best Ў®cause sheЎЇs the one my heart beats for

All for love
All for love
All for love

All for love
IЎЇm doinЎЇ things iЎЇve never done before
All for love
IЎЇll try my best Ў®cause sheЎЇs the one my heart beats for

All for love
IЎЇm doinЎЇ things iЎЇve never done before
All for love
