Song:

Batten down the hatch
Cause we're all coming in
Like uninvited guests
Romancing everything
Keep your ahnds away
From what you can't afford
We don't think that we'll stay
Now that you look bored
God only knows
What Brian Wilson meant
Pick out your clothes
With some real intent
You don't seem to care
That I've been waiting here
Pulling out my hair
For you to come
My dear
I'll go all the way
As long as you go first
Running all this way
Has given me a thirst
Believe in what you want
As long as you can see
What's right in front of you
I guess that that's just me
