Song:

Oh I am an anti-christ
And I am an anti-christian
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy your passion boy
'cause I, I wanna be, anarchy
In this fu***n' city

Anarchy for the usa
It's coming sometime, maybe
You... Your parents are dreaming their shopping schemes
'cause I wanna be, anarchy
Well it's the only way to be

(solo)

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
There are many ways to get what you want
I use the best, well I use the rest
Well I use the enemy
I use anarchy
'cause I, I wanna be, anarchy
F**k the rat race man

Is this the pmrc
Or is this the dea
Or is this the cia
I thought it was the you. S. A.
Not just another country
Some other fu***n' country
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Oh I wanna fu***n' hear it man
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Let's say it again boys
And I, wanna be, anarchy
Fu***n' destroy
