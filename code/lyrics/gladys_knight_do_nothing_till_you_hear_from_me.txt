Song:

Do nothing till you hear from me,
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam
Of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothing till you hear from me,
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word
Of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart,
The words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing
Till you hear it from me
And you never will

Oh don't you do a nuthin
Pay no attention to the stories
So I've seen another guy or two
Don't mean I'm not in love with you
Why people tear the seam
Of anyone's dream
Ther reason is over my head
Don't you do a thing
Until you hear it from me

Please just consider
What a dance our romance has been
I'd certainly do it again
If you should take the words
Of others you've heard
I haven't got a chance

True, I've been seen
With someone other than you
But does that mean
That now my love's untrue
When we're apart,
The words in my heart
Reveal just how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other lovin arms may hold a thrill
But baby do a nuthin
Till you hear it from me
O just do nuthin
Baby just a wait n and see
Cause baby
Oh no
You never will
You never will
You never will
Oh oh no
You never will
