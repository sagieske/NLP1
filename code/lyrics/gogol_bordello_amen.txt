Song:

On meridians of madness
On the parallels of love
We try hard, run from each other
But our work is never done

So we meet again
(Amen)
And we sigh again
(Amen)
Two of us
No one can undo
(Amen)

So we touch again
(Amen)
And we dance again
(Amen)
I know you, I know you, I know you!

I believe on a hundred dance nights
A thousand ribbons were lost in hay
And we try to hide from each other
But we learned too well to stay

Someone told me, "Every lifetime
We meet same circle of souls
To say thank you or to say sorry
And once again exchange our roles"

So we meet again
(Amen)
And we sigh again
(Amen)
Because two of us
No one can undo
(Amen)

So we touch again
(Amen)
And we dance again
(Amen)
And I know you, I know you, I know you better than you do!

There were times of total insanity
Proof no use of any vanity

When I get you down
I heal you best I can
But when I hit the ground
Oh well, we'll meet again

So we meet again
(Amen)
And we sigh again
(Amen)
The two of us
No one can undo
(Amen)

So we touch again
(Amen)
And we dance again
(Amen)
Because I know you, I know you, I know you better than you do!

So we meet again
(Amen)
And we sigh again
(Amen)
Two of us
No one can undo
(Amen)

So we touch again
(Amen)
And we dance again
(Amen)
I know you, I know you, I know you better than you do!
I know you, I know you, I know you better than you do!
