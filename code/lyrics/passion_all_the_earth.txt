Lead Worshipper: Charlie Hall

Praise the Father, Who from heaven came to me
By the Savior, in His mercy, set me free

Yeah, I run like the river, dance like the summer
Joy is in my heart, You have satisfied my soul

Praise His name, praise His name, all the earth celebrate
Praise His name, praise His name all the earth...
