Song:

We're not deaf to the music or blind to the groove We're just doing the things that we want to
(But they are) Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove

Are you in communication? Do you fit in to their plans? They're coming to rock your whole
Foundation Take you to another land, yeah You gotta start moving, gotta start grooving Gotta
Start breaking away cause they're leading you too far into the future When you're living here
Today 2, 3, 4

Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah) Cos' they are blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah)

They're not opening their mind up to what we do They're not coming around to our point of view
Could be a little profound but it's oh so true You've gotta hold on baby, hold on to Your
Motivation, it'll take you to An elevation that'll turn into A celebration and we'll party
Through The liberation baby of me and you

We're not deaf to the music or blind to the groove We're just doing the things that we want to
Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah) Cos' they are blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah)

I've come back to the home I knew And now I'm rolling, I wanna rock with you But it's coming
On, coming on strong And I'm hearing it all, feeling it all come down Onto me the rights and
Wrongs The do's, the don'ts, it won't be long Before I blow it all, blow it all gone I'm
Watching it all, watching it all go down

Well, they're giving you black When all you want is the blue And then they're holding you back
When you gotta go thru' It's a matter of fact, it's a matter for you We get habit attacks, we
Do what we want to

Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah) Cos' they are blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah)

We're not deaf to the music or blind to the groove We're just doing the things that we want to
Cos' they are blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah) Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah)
Cos' they are blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah)

(Motivation) (Elevation) (Celebration)

Blind (Yeah) Blind to the groove (Yeah) Blind to, Blind to (yeah) Blind to, Blind to (yeah)
Blind to, Blind to (yeah) Blind to, Blind to (yeah)
