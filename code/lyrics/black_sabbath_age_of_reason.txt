Song:

Do you hear the thunder, raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world that's gonna die
In the age of reason, how do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravage through so many lives
So many lives (x2)

Mystifying silence, talking peace on Earth
We should just join for ourselves, not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction, a fractured human race
A changing revolution disappears without a trace
Without a trace (x2)
Alright yeah!

Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seas of change that don't bear through

Oh yeah!
These times are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over, but the war goes on
Politics, religion, love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah!
