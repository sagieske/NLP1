Song:

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Like a thief in the light, you can't hide, you can't hide from your shadow
It's the only thing you own
And you don't need to pretend that perfection is your friend
'Cause we're all broken.
We all end up alone

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
Beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human
Show me that you're human

You're a spark without flame
I'm a desert in the rain,
You're a mountain and I'm a stepping stone
So walk away from your pride
It's a demon in disguise
And it won't help you to calm the swelling tide

Oh
Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh love your flaws and live for your mistakes
And beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human
Oh oh oh

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
And beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human

Oh oh oh oh oh...

Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
And beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer show the marks upon your skin
(Show me that you're human)
Show me that you're human, you won't break
Oh, love your flaws and live for your mistakes
And beauty's on the surface wearing thin
Come closer show the marks upon your skin
Show me that you're human
