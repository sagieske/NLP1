Song:

Let her be she belongs to me
And the moment comes when I no longer know your name

A lonely maiden stands beyond infernal fire
A prince awaits his destiny for all the time
Oh baby darling you will see
Your blood belongs to him
A soulless feast
Reborn by the power of the darkness face
A rebirth of his lover to avenge his hate
Oh baby darling you will see
Your blood belongs to him
A soulless feast

Heaven betrayed you
They said that her soul could not be saved
A better believer

The blood is life his sword sacrificed the cross
Returning with a hunger by the power of love
Oh baby darling you will see
Your blood belongs to him
A soulless feast

Heaven betrayed you
They said that her soul could not be saved
A better believer

Let her be she belongs to me
And the moment comes when I no longer know your name

A lonely maiden stands beyond infernal fire
A prince awaits his destiny for all the time
Oh baby darling you will see
Your blood belongs to him
A soulless feast
Reborn by the power of the darkness face
A rebirth of his lover to avenge his hate
Oh baby darling you will see
Your blood belongs to him
A soulless feast

Heaven betrayed you
They said that her soul could not be saved
A better believer

Let her be she belongs to me
And the moment comes when I no longer know your name
