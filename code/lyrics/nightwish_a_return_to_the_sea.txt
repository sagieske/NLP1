Song:

A star falls down from the darkened sky
Where new worlds born and die
Kingdom Animalia watches it's approaching glow
What it means is soon to be known

Beneath the lovely birch honeymakers build their nest in peace
On the savannah a lion licks a wounded gnu
To honor this moment even the heavens cease
Giant spiders learn how to swim
With whales they form a united kin

Snakes say hello to the rats on the ground
In the meadows play merrily the fox and the hound

Trilobite & Anymalocharis
The prey and the hunter
Survival of the fittest
Fall of Man

Seadrops foam all empty human skulls
Those on the shores of Atlantis
Darwin's resurrection is witnessed
By turtles he used to play with

Healed and happy She oversees
The Mother
The tyrant's return to the sea
