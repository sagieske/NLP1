Song:

Back down, down to the downtown
Down to the lockdown...
Boards, nails lie around

I crouch like a crow
Contrasting the snow
For the agony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I am blindsided

Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plightless

I come through the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I am blindsided

Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Ooh, for me now

Taut line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light

There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
