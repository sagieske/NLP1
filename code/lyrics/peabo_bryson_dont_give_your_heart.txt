Song:

There've been too many sad goodbyes
Too many tears I've cried
Promises made and dreams that died
Have left me hurt inside

I want your love
Like none I've known before
But unless you're sure

Don't you give your heart
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just the part
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

It takes so long for me to mend
Each time love comes to an end
Don't think I'll make it through
That's why I must know the truth

Am I the one that you can't live without?
If there's any doubt

Don't you give your heart
(Don't give your heart)
Unless you give it all the way
Don't give me just a part
(Not just a part)
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

If you really truly care
All I ask is you be fair with me
'Cause the longer that you keep making me wait
The harder it's gonna be to take

Don't give your heart
Don't give me just a part
(Not just a part)
'Cause that would be too cruel a game to play
Be sure or don't you give your heart

Don't give your heart unless you give it
(Give it all the way)
All the way, baby, don't give
(My love)
My love
(You do to take it all the way)
Unless you give it
(All the way)
My love, my love, don't give your heart
