Song:

Because we know that this day would eventually come to
So I do not care about as long as your heart can live better
Did you love is you when I cry
I tasted on my side there is the feeling of being loved

Thank you for your good I will never forget
Although the taste of fresh out slowly and slowly
Tonight we meet again be considered the final
Agreed they do not she'd tears

We walk our earlier estimates in the cruel heart
Who'll be the murderer who say that the export you or me
All of our all as long as another step in all
Will be able to escape to have been free to

Please do not crylikethisisasurprise
Cry even more hard to get out onlymakethings
Do not change my love is time trouble
Girlyouknowthat, right?

Hey you dry your tears
Hey you stop your feet
Onemorestep
That'sallthatwehaveleft

Thank you for your good I will never forget
Although the taste of fresh out slowly and slowly
Tonight we meet again be considered the final
Agreed they do not she'd tears

We walk our earlier estimates in the cruel heart
Who'll be the murderer who say that the export you or me
All of our all as long as another step in all
Will be able to escape to have been free to

We walk our earlier estimates in the cruel heart
Who'll be the murderer who say that the export you or me
All of our all as long as another step in all
Will be able to escape to have been free to
