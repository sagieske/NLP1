Song:

Hush now little babe
The evening's grown older
A day's standing frozen
Cold hearts are colder

You think you were right
But no one would listen
Don't worry little girl
They don't know what they're missing

World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again
World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again

Sleep now little girl
I'll sing you a lullabye
There's no need to listen
But darling don't you cry

This world is getting older
Older by the day
I'll see you around my friend
I hope that you'd stay

World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again
World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again

Hush now little babe
The evening's grown older
A day's standing frozen
Cold hearts are colder

You think you were right
But no one would listen
Don't worry little girl
They don't know what they're missing

World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again
World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again

World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again
World turning round, turning round
Turning over and over again
