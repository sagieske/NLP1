(Safka)
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Well it's the only thing I could do half right
And it's turning out all wrong
Look what they've done to my song
Wish I could find a good book to live in
Wish I could find a good book to live in
I'd never have to come out and
Look what they've done to my song
Look what they've done to my brain, Ma
Well they've cook it like a chicken bone
I think I'm half insane, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Ils ont changй ma chanson Ma
Ils ont changй ma chanson
C'est le seul chose je peux fais
Est-ce-que n'est pas bonne, Ma?
Ils ont changй ma chanson
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Well they've tied it up in a plastic bag
Then turned it upside down
Look what they've done to my song
La, la, la, la...
Well it's the only thing I could do half right
And it's turning out all wrong
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Oh Mama
Well they've cook it like a chicken bone
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song, Ma!
