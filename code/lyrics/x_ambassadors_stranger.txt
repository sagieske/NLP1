Song:

I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
But I'll be happy when you're gone
Happy when you're gone
Oh
I wait for you

I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
And watch you waste away
While I watch you waste away
Oh

Cause lately
When you see me
And you get that look in your eye
Could you be more
Elusive
Talking shit, talking shit
Baby don't say
You're sorry
It's not the end of the world
But you gotta know
One thing
I won't be waiting long

Cause now you look at me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
You're treating me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh

I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
And watch you waste away
While I watch you waste away
Oh
I wait for you

Cause lately
When I see you
And you get that look in your eye
Could you be more
Elusive
Talking shit, talking shit
Baby don't say
You're sorry
It's not the end of the world
But you gotta know
One thing
I won't be waiting long

Cause now you look at me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
You're treating me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh

We will never get back to where we used to be
Used to be
We will never get back to where we used to be
Used to be
Could we ever get back to where we used to be
Used to be
Could we ever get back to where we
Back to where we used to be

Cause now you look at me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
You're treating me
Like a stranger
Don't say nothing at all
Don't say nothing at all
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
A stranger to you
Oh
