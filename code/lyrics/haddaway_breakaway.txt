Song:

Breakaway
Breakaway
We gotta breakaway

Modern people
Want to live in a modern life
Though they trick and take
Rip and rape
Destroy the things that are right
They came to my town
I was a boy
Just about five
Today we demonstrate, litigate
Even show our might

Breakaway
I wanna know just what it is
We gotta breakaway

Race colour

She was a right wing
I was a left
Together we're strong
We will crucify
Just plain denied
To practice out our rights
Those were the bad days
Today we're rich
And we have kids
But they didn't learn
Through all the hurt
The meaning of our might

Breakaway
I wanna know just what it is
We gotta breakaway

You know it's in our past
We had to sacrifice a lot
It was give and take
For the human race
Just learning right from wrong
They put it in our minds
And now they're putting it in your
So learn to fight the hate
For the human race
Or we're lost

Breakaway breakaway breakaway
Breakaway
We gotta breakaway

Breakaway
I wanna know just what it is
We gotta breakaway
