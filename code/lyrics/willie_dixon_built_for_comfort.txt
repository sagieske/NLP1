Song:

Some folks are built like this
Some folks are built like that
But the way I'm built
Now, don't you call me fat

'Cause I'm-a built for comfort
I ain't a-built for speed
But I got ev'rything
A-that a good girl need

Some folks they rip and run
Some folks don't believe in sign
But you get me, babe
You got to take your time

'Cause I'm-a built for comfort
I ain't a-built for speed
And I got ev'rything
A-that a good girl need

(sax & instrumental)

Now, don't you call me fat
Because you know I'm fine
You get me, baby
You've got to take your time

'Cause I'm-a built for comfort
I ain't a-built for speed
And I got ev'rything
A-that a good girl needs

(piano, bass & instrumental)

Well, I ain't got the diamonds
And I ain't got gold
But I do have a love
To satisfy your soul

'Cause I'm built for comfort
I ain't a-built for speed
And I got ev'rything
A-that any little good girl needs.

(instrumental to end fade)
