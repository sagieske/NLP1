Song:

Hey Hey Hey
The devil is always behind you
Wanting you to stop the faith
But I'm telling you keep on running
That race
Resist the devil and he will certainly
Flee from you
You will be covered underneath
God's Grace

Hey Hey Hey Don't Give Up

Don't Give Up
Keep on running that race
Show the devil that you are in a place
That you will not give up
You will be fully covered with God's Grace
Don't Give Up (3x)

Everytime you want to pray
The devil is always in your way
Everytime you want to worship
Satan is by you
Just keep on rebuking renouncing defeating
The devil
For God is on your side

Don't Give Up
Keep on running that race
Show the devil that you are in a place
That you will not give up
You will be fully covered with God's Grace
Don't Give Up (3x)

Hey Hey Hey Don't Give Up (3x)
Let me see your hands Up
Thumbs up
Wake up
Cause we're giving God the praise
We are not giving up
Don't Give Up (3x)
Don't Give Up (3x)
When I say Don't you say give up
Don't Give (Up)
Don't Give (Up)
Don't Give Up

Don't Give Up
Keep on running that race
Show the devil that you are in a place
That you will not give up
You will be fully covered with God's Grace
Don't Give Up (3x)
