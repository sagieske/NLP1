Song:

So we got to go together
The party is so important
We'll split up forever
Even though you don't know why
You 're not on my side
Still we got to go together

Bag on your head
Beautiful inside
Bag on your head
Wake me up I'm alive

So you say you don't remember
Happy hour from five to September
When I bite my hand I'm fine
When you scream that's when you shine
Still gone
Still don't remember
