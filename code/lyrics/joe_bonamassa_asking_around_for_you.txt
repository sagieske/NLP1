Song:

If I get to heaven
The first thing I'll do
Before I meet my maker
I'm gonna ask around for you
All of heaven gotta know
The beauty of the truth
I'll tap an angel on the shoulder
And I'll be asking around for you

I'm sure you found a place up there
Where we all can sit and talk a while
Play some cards and drink black coffee
I'd love to see you smile
If I get to heaven know
Oh I'm praying that I do
I'll be the first thing I do
I'll tap an angel on the shoulder
And I'll be asking around for you

I'm sure you found a place up there
Where we all can sit and talk a while
Play some cards and drink black coffee
I'd love to see you smile
If I get to heaven know
Oh I'm praying that I do
I'll be the first thing I do
I'll tap an angel on the shoulder
And I'll be asking around for you
I'll tap an angel on the shoulder
And I'll be coming around
With you
