Song:

Bless this house
O Lord we pray
Make it safe
By night and day

Bless these walls
So firm and stout
Keeping want
And trouble out

Bless the roof
And chimneys tall
Let thy peace
Lie overall

Bless this door
That it may prove
Ever open
To joy and love

Bless these windows
Shining bright
Letting in God's
Heavenly light
Bless the hearth
Ablazing there
With smoke ascending
Like a prayer

Bless the people
Here within
Keep them pure
And free from sin

Bless us all
That we may be
Fit O Lord
To dwell
With Thee

Bless us all
That one day
We may dwell
O Lord
With Thee
