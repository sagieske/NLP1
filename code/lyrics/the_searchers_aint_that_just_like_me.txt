Song:

Mary had a little lamb
It's fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

Now ain't that
Just like me (what you say baby)
Followin' you around
You know that I love you (yeah)
I love you (come on baby)
I just can't put you down

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the kings horses and all the kings men
They couldn't put him back again

Now ain't that
Just like me (what you say baby)
Crackin' up over you
You know that I love you (yeah)
I love you (come on baby)
Nothin' else I can do
Well shake it up now

Hey Diddle Diddle the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon
The little cat came out the best of all
And the dish ran away with the spoon

Now ain't that
Just like me (what you say baby)
Tryin' to run away with you
You know that I love you (yeah)
I love you (come on baby)
Don't you wanna love me too (take it easy)
Don't you wanna love me too (take it easy)
Don't you wanna love me too (take it easy)
Don't you wanna love me too (come on, come on now)
Don't you wanna love me too (let me hear ya)
Don't you wanna love me too (take it easy baby)
Don't you wanna love me too (all right now)
Don't you wanna love me too (tell me 'bout it)
Don't you wanna love me too (come on now)
Don't you wanna love me too (tell me 'bout it)
Don't you wanna love me too (shake it up now)
Don't you wanna love me too (it's all right now)
Don't you wanna love me too (shake it up now)
Don't you wanna love me too (waah-hooo!)
Don't you wanna love me too (shake it up now)
Don't you wanna love me too (come on baby)
Don't you wanna love me too
