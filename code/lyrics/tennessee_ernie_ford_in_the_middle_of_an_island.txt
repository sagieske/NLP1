Song:

In the middle of an island
In the middle of an ocean
You and I beneath the moonlight
Just the monkeys and the palm trees

In the middle of an island
Plenty time to do some kissin'
Plenty time for lots o' lovin'
And walkin' barefoot in the sand

Though there's no island at all
Just a picture on my wall
My darling how I wish we could be

In the middle of an island
In the middle of an ocean
You and I forever darling
In the paradise for two

We'll go swimming everyday and have fun
And we'll lay on the beach in the sun
We'll eat coconuts and fish and be free
To do the things that come naturally

In the middle of an island
In the middle of an ocean
You and I beneath the moonlight
Just the monkeys and the palm trees

In the middle of an island
Plenty time to do some kissin'
Plenty time for lots o' lovin'
And walkin' barefoot in the sand

Though there's no island at all
Just a picture on my wall
My darling how I wish we could be

In the middle of an island
In the middle of an ocean
You and I forever darling
In the paradise for two

In the middle of an island
With you
