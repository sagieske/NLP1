Song:

Put your hand down, boy
Welcome to my zoo
Put your hate inside
Might be black while white
I can still help you

See those snake bamboo
Funky shake a** move
Honey, can you spy
The divine apes wine
'Cause he can't see you

I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted, too
Five fingers, two black wounds
I'm a man, don't speak me a lie
Got toes and I can't smile
I'm crooked but alright

And I ever want
Is just a little love
I say it to the birds in the pond
And all I ever want
Is breaking me apart
I sink through the thing that I once was

I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted, too
Five fingers, two black wounds
I'm a man, don't speak me a lie
Got toes and I can't smile
I'm crooked but alright

To the left now, boy
Underneath the moon
By the thick tankan in the tall grass
One more thing for you

See the distant flume
In the snippy dunes
Makes my nerves cringe cold
And my bones go cold
When I see their rune

And I ever want
Is just a little love
I say it to the birds in the pond
And all I ever want
Is breaking me apart

I'm a man, I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted, too
Five fingers, two black wounds
I'm a man, don't speak me a lie
Got toes and I can't smile
I'm crooked but alright
