Song:

Thirteen times you, with my karma
And thirteen times I fucked up your dogma
You taught me to hate
You taught me to crawl

You raised your hand as you raised the bottle
You knock me down but it made me stronger
The harder you hit
The harder you fall

And this one is for my mother
What will I do without her
Don't look back
Don't even bother

And this one is for the father
Who loves his little daughter
Thought I am
Don't even bother

You can freak out about me
But you'd lose your mind without me
You thought you could see right through me
But it made no difference to me
Anyway, anyway

A free reign gave you ammunition
To play the game and, other women
And something just snapped
And cracked in my brain

A thirteen times I sucked up inside me
The different ways that you tried to harm me
You did it once
You'll do it again

And this one is for my sister
You dare to denigrate her
Don't look back
Don't even bother

And this one's for my lover
The one who had to suffer
Thought I am
Don't even bother

You can freak out about me
But you'd lose your mind without me
You thought you could see right through me
But it made no difference to me
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway

Thirteen times, one, thirteen times, two
Thirteen times, three, thirteen times, four
Thirteen times, five, thirteen times, six
Thirteen times, seven, thirteen times eight
