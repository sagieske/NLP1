Song:

I look into the mirror
See myself, I'm over me
I need space for my desires
Have to dive into my fantasies
I know as soon as I'll arrive
Everything is possible
Cause no one has to hide
Beyond the invisible
Sajaja bramani totari ta, raitata raitata, radu ridu raitata, rota
The brave and wise men came together on horse
Close your eyes
Just feel and realize
It is real and not a dream
I'm in you and you're in me
It is time
To break the chains of life
If you follow you will see
What's beyond reality
Ne irascaris Domine,
Ne ultra memineris iniquitatis:
Ecce civitas Sancti facta est deserta:
Sion deserta facta est:
Ierusalem desolata est:
Domus sanctificationis tuae et gloriae tuae Do not be angry Lord,
Or remember iniquity forever:
Behold the Holy City is a desert:
Sion is mad a desert:
Jerusalem is desolate:
The house of your holiness and glory
