Song:

Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by
[ piano ]
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and drear
While they are others living about us living so wicked year after year
Farther along we'll know all about it...
