Song:

Don't put your finger up your nose
'Cause your nose knows, it's not the place it goes
You can sniffle, you can sneeze but I'm askin' you, please
Don't put your finger up your nose

Don't stick your finger up your ear
'Cause then your ear will find it hard to hear
You can thump it an you can tug it but please, don't plug it
Don't stick your finger up your ear

Don't put your finger up your nose
'Cause your nose knows, it's not the place it goes
You can sniffle, you can sneeze but I'm askin' you, please
Don't put your finger up your nose

Don't put your finger in your eye
It's not a thing you think you gotta try
You can blink it you can wink it but I don't think it
Would be good to put your finger in your eye

Don't put your finger up your nose
'Cause your nose knows, it's not the place it goes
You can sniffle, you can sneeze but I'm askin' you, please
Don't put your finger up your nose

Don't stick your finger down your throat
'Cause that'd just make you start to choke
Then up will come your dinner, an' you'll start to look much thinner
Don't stick your finger down your throat

Don't put your finger up your nose
'Cause your nose knows, it's not the place it goes
You can sniffle, you can sneeze but I'm askin' you, please
Don't put your finger up your nose

Don't put your finger up your nose
'Cause your nose knows, it's not the place it goes
You can sniffle, you can sneeze but I'm askin' you, please
Don't put your finger up your nose

At least not in front of me
