Song:

[Chorus:]
One suit, one suit was all I had
One suit, one suit was all I had
One suit, one suit was all I had
And it was nothin' but an old gray, beat up plaid

I had the best lookin' gal in town
And she weighed about a hundred and eleven pounds
But I felt so shamed when I called on her
'Cause I was ragged as a great big

One suit, one suit was all I had
One suit, hmmmm one suit was all I had
One suit, one suit was all I had
And it was nothin' but an old gray, beat up plaid

Now the cups are frayed, the pants are shiny
Got a rip in the seam that ain't exactly tiny
Pleats in the front, belt in the back
I got a great like a shape of a flower sack

When my gal took me to her home
And her mama put the pots and the skillets on
But I ate one helpin' and that was all
'Cause if I gained a pound my suit would
Eww, be too small

[Repeat chorus]

I close my story with these few lines
As I stand here a-diggin' those men's wear signs
With my pockets empty as they can be
Well you're in bad shape, buddy
If you look like me
