Song:

He pulled out in a cloud of dust
Layin' rubber and spewin' rust
And on any road he'd take
He'd have his foot on the pedal but my heart on the brake
Underneath the smooth tar curves
A road is only dust and dirt
On a lonely interchange
The signs all look the same
'Cause a road is just a road and a feelin's just a feelin'
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Antone
A road is just a road when the one you love is leavin' on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago
He pulled out of sight of me
Believin' that I'd set him free
But I'd heard the voice of the prisoner
Sayin' he couldn't get enough of her
You can go by land, you can go by air
Go by sea, hell I don't care
You can go anyway you choose
Wearin' out the soles of your travelin' shoes
'Cause a road is just a road and a feelin's just a feelin'
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Antone
A road is just a road when the one you love is leavin' on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago
(Bangor Maine to El Paso)
And every sleepless night I see him screamin' by the scenery
Not noticing another mile that's rolled on between him and me
'Cause a road is just a road and a feelin's just a feelin'
No matter where you go
From Bakersfield to San Antone
A road is just a road when the one you love is leavin' on
And midnight's another dawn a hundred miles ago
(Waterloo to San Bernardino)
(Washington to Amarillo
