Song:

You can reach my by railway
You can reach me train way
You can reach me
On an airplane
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Oh, its something to get over
If I had my way
Surely you would be closer

I need you closer
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can
