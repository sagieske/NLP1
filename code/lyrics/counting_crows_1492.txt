Song:

I'm a Russian Jew American
Impersonating African Jamaican What I want to be is an Indian
I'm gonna be a cowboy in the end
I guess I bought a gun
Because it impresses all the litle girls I see
And then they all wanna sleep with me
Oh whre did we disappear
Into the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end
Where these people who impersonate our friends
Say come again come again come again
Into the dark Italian underground
With disco lights and disco sounds and skinny
Girls who drink champagne
Then they take me on their knees again,
And pull me up and out the door
Past railway cars and tranny-whores
And mornings spreading out across the feathered thighs of angels
Oh were did we disappear to
The silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end
Will they try to get you out to pull you in
And all these people, they've been? Come again
In 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue
In 1493 he came home across the deep blue sea
In 1494 he did it with the girl next door
In 1495 he barely made it out alive
In 1964???? Busting out the door
In 1970 some people got their hands on me
Now I am the king of everything
I am the king of nothing now
I am the king of everything
I am the king of nothing
Oh where did we disappear
To the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end Where these people
Who impersonate our friends Say come again come again come
Come again Oh where did we disappear
To the silence that surrounds us and then drowns us in the end When they try to push you out to get you in
And all these people who impersonate our friends Say come again come again come
Come again come again come again
