Song:

Pick up the pieces that I've left behind.
I woke up today feeling older and never so much better.
I know I talk in circles.
I never wanted to avoid your conversation.
You see yourself in my eyes.
I'll never take it back.
Another day has passed us by.
The more time I spend, the less I see of you.
Guiding over every move that I make.
I'll never want it back
Your voice is like an angel
Nothing can replace what I gained.

The direction that you gave me.
You see yourself in my eyes.
Another day has passed us by.
The more time I spend, the less I see of you.
Time grabs me by the shoulders.

I know I'm still far from you
No one knows how it feels to move over.
And it feels like I'm still far from home.

My name isn't disappointment.
Kept away from everyone else.
I only disappoint myself.
If only I could hold this moment

(x2)
Please don't change.
You're getting old and so am I.
I know I've made mistakes.
Please don't change.
It's been this way a hundred times.
Please don't change.
Please don't change.

Time grabs me by the shoulders.
I know I'm still far from you
No one knows how it feels to move over.
And it feels like I'm still far from home.

If only I could hold this moment
My name isn't disappointment.
Kept away from everyone else.
(x2i only disappoint myself.
