Song:

Blood sky every morning
Should have seen the warning
Captain to the seamen
Man your battle stations
Poseidon's on a mission
About to turn it up to eleven

Captain to the seamen
Assume crash positions
Toss the extras over
About to take on water

Blood sky every morning
(All hands on deck)
Should have seen the warning
(Crash positions)
Poseidon's on a mission
(Brace yourself)
About to turn it up to eleven

Mind the sails, mind the sails!
All hands on, all hands on deck!
Women and children first!
Bail! Son of... Bail, bail, bail!
Brace yourself, brace yourself!
Brace yourself, brace yourself for twelve!
All hands on, all hands on deck!
All hands on, all hands on...

Blood sky every morning
(All hands on, all hands on deck!)
Should have seen the warning
(Would've, could've, should've!)
Poseidon's on a mission
(Brace yourself, brace yourself!)
About to turn it up to eleven
(Brace yourself, brace yourself for twelve!)

Captain to the seamen
(Here come the gales! Mind the sails!)
Assume impact position
(All hands on, all hands on deck!)
Toss the extras over
(Women and children, women and children first!)
About to take on water
(Bail! Son of... Bail! Bail! Bail!)
Posidon's on a mission
(Brace yourself, brace yourself!)
About to turn it up to eleven
(Brace yourself, brace yourself for twelve!)
Poseidon's on a mission
(Brace yourself, brace yourself!)
About to turn it up to eleven
(Brace yourself, brace yourself for twelve!)
