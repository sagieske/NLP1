Song:

Our God is the awesome God
There's none like you
With Him we win
He's our champion

Our God is the awesome God
Greatest in all the earth
With Him we come first
He's our champion

With Him we can't lose
We always win
He's our champion

We lift our hands
We lift our voices
We celebrate, our champion
We sing hallle, hallelujah
For the King who reigns victorious

Our God is the awesome God
There's none like Him
With Him we win
He's our champion

Our God is the awesome God
The greatest in all the earth
With Him we come in first

With Him we can't loose
We always win
He's our champion

We lift our hands
We lift our voices
We celebrate, our champion
We sing halle-hallelujah
For the King who reigns victorious.

We lift our hands
We lift our voice
We celebrate, our champion.

We sing halle-hallelujah
For the King who reigns victorious
Victorious
