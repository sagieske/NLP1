Song:

When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too
And I wish God would send me a word send me something I'm afraid to lose
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives
I get shivers down my spine and all I wanna do is hold you tight

Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street
Tonight there's calling strangers, hear them crying in defeat.
Let them go, let them go, let them go do their dances of the dead (let 'em go right ahead)
And dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon c'mon let's go to bed, 

Baby, baby, baby
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes
And to taste your tender charms
And I just wanna sleep tonight again in your arms

There's machines and there's fire waiting at the edge of town
They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now
Cause you've got, you've got, you've got my love girl, you've got my love girl
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain
You've got, you've got, you've got my, my love... heart and soul...
