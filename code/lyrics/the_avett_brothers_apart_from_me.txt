Song:

I was scared but I couldn't admit it
Hatred planted out of fear
Fight or flight, no choice but to hit it
The road, it calls on me my dear

I was lost as lost can be
Being praised for being found
All that praise got lost on me
As a mood swing was headed down

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me
Where I'm going
The part you'll see
How true it is and how back then
It possibly was impossible for you or me to know it

Your touch was nothing more
Than a child's goodbye and hello
It always left me feeling
Worse when it was time to go

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me
Where I'm going
The part you'll see
How true it is and how back then
It possibly was impossible for you or me to know it

And most of us out there got fooled
Cause the gold it glittered in the night
We chased it fast like drunk buffoons 
The banker lived the artist died

And all our clothes were washed in gray
All our buildings and our cars
As the fluorescent light of day
Bleached the sky and took the stars

Apart from me
I would not dare take someone in love with me
Where I'm going
The part you'll see
How true it is and how back then
It possibly was impossible for you or me to know it
