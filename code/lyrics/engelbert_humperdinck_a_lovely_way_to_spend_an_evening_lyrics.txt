Song:

This is a lovely way to spend an evening.
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, 
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

A casual stroll through a garden. a kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a
Show
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio
Some like to live for the moment, some like to just
Reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend. just give me one
Like this
