Song:

Baby, I know sometimes that you want to erase me.
Especially after what we've been through lately.
You know I didn't mean to call you crazy.

Lovely, I know that your sister doesn't trust me.
I ain't saying there's a halo above me,
But you can't let the rumors take you from me.

Lets make this so good for goodness sake.
The last thing that we needs to take a break.

Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you, back to you.
Let me know what I have to say so you think of me.
So you think of me, think of me.
Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you.

Gorgeous, no one said relationships were flawless.
But I'm down to work on something off this.
Don't you see my names down with a flouriest?

I'm beggin, I'm beggin, I'm beggin, I'm beggin I'm beggin, beggin.

Lets make this so good for goodness sake.
The last thing that we needs to take a break.

Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you, back to you.
Let me know what I have to say so you think of me.
So you think of me, think of me.
Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you.

Start a brand new chapter, turn a brand new page.
Cause there is no story if I lose your face.
Start a brand new chapter, turn a brand new page.
Cause there is no story.

Oh yeahh

Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you, back to you.
Let me know what I have to say so you think of me.
So you think of me, think of me.
Let me know what I have to do to get back to you.
To get back to you.
