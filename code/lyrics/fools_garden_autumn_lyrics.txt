Song:

We control the world we use the endless sky above
And sometimes we believe
Some say we make history though the air breathe
Is still the same today
And when the land begins to call
The sprites they dance
The leaves they fall
The change's begun and what remains
Not even thoughts -- not even names
We can remember can forget
We can achieve the highest aims
But we won't change the rules we're depending on
Now the freak of nature's holding up the mirror
To the haughty thoughts
Our brains are filled up
Don't you feel the earth is trembling
To heal the wounds we injured to her heart
The things are easy as they are
And when the land begins to call
The sprites they dance
The leaves they fall
The change's begun and what remains
Not even thoughts -- not even names
And when the time begins to fade
The side-scene changes because it's late
We cannot keep -- we drop the ball
For now the land begins to call
