Song:

Somewhere the horizon draws a line
Between the sea and the sky
And in that line of land
You'll find a heart no rain can wash away


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all


This is where we live
This is where we breathe
This is where we sow
This is where we reap
This is where we live


Walk the promised land
And ride the waves upon the floaming sea
Live are but with the hands and not with words
But words can make you see


The sun slips in, it's beautiful
It's everything at once
An open field a line of trees
A right for one and all
