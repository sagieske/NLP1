Song:

Pledging your allegiances, sparing me your grievances
Hip-Hop saved my life so I put biggie right where Jesus is
Part of my scheme of things, free my wings
Shine with Stephens Kings, shock your chakras with constant gossip talking awkward awesome that this automatic weapon the buyers I collided with
Don't promote the violence I am of a higher consciousness
Live it like that definition [?]
Dirty like them project steps, make my body rest, take a breath
Never refuse until my time [?] because I refill the chronic until my eyes rolled back
I was 16 when I met shrooms now I [?] What's her name again?
Funny n****s playing games to win, I'd rather elevate and raise the brim
I put that on christ, my soul, my life if you wanna catch a riot better hold on tight
This ain't normally my style, always [?] down to the weapon my n****s straight flexing bruh
Nypd the [?] don't make you buff
I back on you, the actors do, I roll it [?] so don't forget it, m**********r this is Erick not a gimmick, b***h

But you know what they say, the beast lives in the East
While we deep in the belly of the city that never sleeps
It's the city where the skinny n****s ride [?]
Life of a homicide and collide with police

But you know what they say, the beast lives in the East
While we deep in the belly of the city that never sleeps
It's the city where the skinny n****s ride [?]
Life of a homicide and collide with police

Got my optics on the money I will not close my eyes
Acid [?]
I done seen s**t you silly n****s can't fathom
Golden cap mushrooms now I'm only seeing atoms
It's insanity of sanity, [?] over vanity
Zombie gang walking casuality, b***h n***a I already died for my faculty
Got infinite bullets for you f*****g mere mortals, I'm dumping shots at the sky asking God to open his portal
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha, check out this bizarre flow that I be dishing off
I'm so in tune with myself, I can shave my f*****g balls
With a razor blade in the dark and not leave a f*****g mark
See I can spit that fly s**t, that auto-pilot high s**t
That [?] you and I [?] s**t
That P-I-M-P group of b*****s on my side s**t
Sour diesel weed, thc make my eyes drip
N-Y-P-D they on my d**k, L-S-D now a n***a on his [?] s**t
She's mesmerized you know, from that flashing light s**t, she likes it

But you know what they say, the beast lives in the East
While we deep in the belly of the city that never sleeps
It's the city where the skinny n****s ride [?]
Life of a homicide and collide with police

But you know what they say, the beast lives in the East
While we deep in the belly of the city that never sleeps
It's the city where the skinny n****s ride [?]
Life of a homicide and collide with police
