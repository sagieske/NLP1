Song:

[Chorus:]
Everything He said
In His word
He will do it for you
Every prophecy He gave
Every promise He made
He will do it for you

If you only trust Him
And let Him have his way
He'll work things out for you
If you only believe and
You will see
That He will do it
For you

Everything He said
In His word
He will do it (He'll do it) for you
Every prophecy He gave
Every promise He made
He will do it (He will do it)
Yes He will do it
My God will do it-
He will do it for you

[Tempo change]
[chorus: as desired]

Yes everything He said
In His Holy Word
I know that He'll do it
He will do it
For you
Every single prophecy He gave
And every promise he made
I know He will do it
For you

Everything He said
In His holy holy word
In His Word
I know that he'll do it
He'll do it
For you
Every single prophecy He gave
And every promise He made
He'll do it- He will do it
Everytime He will do it
Yes He will do it
He will always do it
My God will do it
For you...
For you...
Just for you
For you...
For you, and you, and you

He'll do it
He will do it
My god is a faithful God
He will do it
And He's always there
To answer every prayer
He will do it

He'll do it
No matter what you're going through
He'll do it
Remember His word is true
He'll do it
Jesus will do it
He'll do it
Cause he understands
He wil do it
You can always trust and lean on him
Yes He will do it
Whatever it is, he'll do it
My god will do it
For you...
