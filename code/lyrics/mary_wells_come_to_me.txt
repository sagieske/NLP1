Song:

Come on now, come-a come-a come-a
Come on now, come-a come-a come-a

Come to me, I love you only
Come to me, I'm so lonely
Come to me, I love you only, baby
Well, you said you'll be comin' whenever I need you
& you can bet I'm gonna please you
So come runnin', 'cause now I need you baby
Hey hey, you know I miss you baby

Well, come when the lights are burnin' low
I wanna hear you knock on my door
Tell me baby that you love me so
Love me, love me, love me till you care no more
Come to me, oh I miss you
Come to me, I wanna kiss you
Come to me, oh I miss you baby
Hey hey, you know I miss you baby

(instrumental)

(repeat previous verse)

You that I, I miss you baby
Come on, come on
