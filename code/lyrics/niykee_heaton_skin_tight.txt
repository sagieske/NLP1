Song:

I don't make promises no,
I never say forever
Never in a million did I think we'd be together
Really knocked me off my game
Now I guess my mind's been changed
I don't even recognize the person in the mirror
Then you come around and make the whole thing clearer
Damn you make me act so bad
I know you can feel me all night
When it comes to you,
I break all the rules

Ain't nobody love me like you do
Boy you got me tripping acting a fool
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk bout it, I don't care
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight, alright

Never ever, ever believe in the happy ending
All them fairy tales always knew they were just pretending
Never gonna be like that
Oops I better take that back

When it comes to you,
I break all the rules!

Ain't nobody love me like you do
Boy you got me tripping acting a fool
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk bout it, I don't care
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight,

You love me like skin tight
You love me like skin tight
You love me like skin tight

Never thought I'd be that girl
Then you came and rocked my world
Never thought I'd be that girl
Then you f****d up my world

Ain't nobody love me like you do
Boy you got me tripping acting a fool
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk bout it, I don't care
We could do this all night, way your body fits right
Way you love me skin tight
Way you love me skin tight

You love me like skin tight
You love me like skin tight
You love me like skin tight
