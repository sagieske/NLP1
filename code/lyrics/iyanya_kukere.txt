All my ladies
All my ladies
Nse nse
Decale oya decale
(D tunes on the beat)

Ale ale ale
All my ladies

Decale oya decale

Kukere, kukere, kukere
I get the money oh
Kukere, kukere, kukere
We make the rock oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Till the early morning oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Oh na na na na
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

Thankful for all he has done
So me I wanna have some fun
Steady rocking to the early morn
Call your friends them, make them come

Yes you could see a star was born
I'm a Don Corleone
Come get some, I'm on the run
Enemies them fire burn

Who God don bless eh
No man can curse eh
You say you say eh
Ale ale ale

Kukere, kukere, kukere
I get the money oh
Kukere, kukere, kukere
We make the rock oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Till the early morning oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Oh na na na na

Decale oya decale

So shake your body
This one happy day
Oya make we they rock, yo eh

Kukere, kukere, kukere

Kukere, kukere, kukere
We make the rock oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Till the early morning oh
Sangele, sangele, sangele
Oh na na na na
