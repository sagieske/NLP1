Verse 1
Well if the wind is her breath then the sun is her glare.
It's hot and it's piercing and it burns when you stare.
She gives me shivers and keeps me warm in a daze.
Like the night she fades away.

Chorus
I don't understand why you have to be constantly distant from me.

Verse 2
There's a lake somewhere full of her tears
With a sign that says "SWIMMERS BEWARE".
I hold my breath as long as I can
But her waves crush me again, and again, and again
