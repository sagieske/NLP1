Song:

I could never repay the debt that I owe
If it had not been for grace
What would I do, where would I go
I was not ready, ready to die
But I wasn't fit to live
But I accepted the gift
That God alone can give

Chorus:
It's amazing, so amazing
Jesus paid the price
There's no penalty
It's amazing, so amazing
The grace God has given to me
Though its undeserved
It's rich and free
It's amazing, so amazing
The grace God has given to me

God gives more grace
As I walk this way
And with each step, each step I take
God leads me to say

Chorus

Ending:
It's amazing, so amazing
The gace God has given to me
It's amazing, so amazing
The grace God has given to me
