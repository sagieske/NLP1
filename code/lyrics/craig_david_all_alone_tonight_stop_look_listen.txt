Song:

Ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh.

[Chorus:]
Stop Look Yehh, Listen to your heart hear what it's saying [x2]

[Verse 1:]
All I can see are all the mistakes I made and Leaving me all alone tonight.
How hard we fall when somebodies hand let's go and sleepless can become the night.
So you see gotta let you know, I would never let you go
I just wanna be there when you turn down the light.
Do I need to spell it out for you?
All the dreams I'm dreaming are times two.
I just wanna be the one that makes it alright, So baby girl...

[Chorus:]
Stop Look Yehh, Listen to your heart hear what it's saying [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Girl there's no chance of us running out of love and when all I can think about is you.
What we have I know is gonna last, All the tears we cried are in the past.
I don't wanna be alone with a photograph, So baby girl...

[Chorus:]
Stop Look Yehh, Listen to your heart hear what it's saying [x4]

[Bridge:]
Ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh.
Girl when it comes to love,
Nobody walks away untouched and you know when it comes to love, nobody get's enough.

[Chorus:]
Stop Look Yehh, Listen to your heart hear what it's saying [x8]
