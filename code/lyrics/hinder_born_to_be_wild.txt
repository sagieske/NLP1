Song:

Get your motor runnin',
Head out on the highway.
We're lookin' for adventure,
And whatever comes our way.

Hey!

Yeah, try and gonna make it happen,
Take the world in a love embrace,
Fire all your guns at once
And explode in space.

I like smokin' lightni'
And heavy metal thunder,
Racin' with the wind
And the feelin' that I'm under.

Yeah, try and go make it happen,
Take the world in a love embrace,
Fire all your guns at once
And explode in space.

Like a true nature child,
I was born (born), born to be wild,
We can climb so high
I never wanna die.

Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild).

A One, Two, Three, Four!

Get your motor runnin',
And head out on the highway.
We're lookin' for adventure,
And whatever comes our way.

Hey!

Yeah, try and go make it happen,
Take the world in a love embrace,
Fire all your guns at once
And explode in space.

Like a true nature child,
I was born (born), born to be wild,
We can climb so high
I never wanna die.

Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild).

A One, Two, Three, Four!

Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild).
