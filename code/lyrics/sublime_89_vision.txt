Song:

Is it because we got the 89 vision?
Whoa, no
And is it because it's a unanimous decision?
Whoa, no

You got yanked by your girl
Boy, you know it hurts
Now she's mine
Oh, no, nine nine

Oh, you should see what your young daughter do
She pulls upon her peaks like a Fu Man Chu
She licks upon my a*** like a Louie dog
She licks upon my a*** like a dirty hog

She sucks upon my butt hole
Like a mot*****in' cripe puff puff puff
Lookin' at me like I wasn't right but
But, but she loves to suck a**
Your girlfriend oh she loves to suck a**

Oh, in 89 vision
God knows
And is it because it's a unanimous decision?
Who know?

Spirit of lord god up high, yeah
Tell me why? Tellin' me why, why not?

And after all that she loves to suck some c***
She love to suck c***, she loves to suck on the c***
She suck so much c*** she almost fell off
She sucked a whole

A little after that she smoked some more c***
A little after that she smoked a little crack
She smoke so much crack that she loves to suck c***, c***
C***, c***, c***, c***, c***, c***, c***, c***, c***, c*** c***

Have you ever? Have you ever?
Have you ever seen a little porno queen?
Whoa, Ron Jeremy, yeah
Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron

Reggae music hits tracks
Simply one voice, one voice
Oh, rebel or not you make a decision
Make a decision, I've done my part

My ding ding it gets so red hey
When she sucks on my M-head, hey, ya
My M-head, my M-head, bo
