Song:

Oh, I miss the comfort of this house.
Where we are, where we are.
Where we are, where we are,
The floor under our feet whispers out,
Come on in, come on in, where it all begin

Can you chase this fire away
Can you chase this fire away

We climbed up to the top in worn out shoes,
But she ran down, she ran down.
She ran down to the house.
A fox that gains our trust
But then breaks it as he walks
Away from us, away from us.

Can you chase this fire away
Can you chase this fire away
In the fall we sleep all day
In the fall we sleep all day

Where we are, Where we are
We sleep all day
Where we are, Where we are
We sleep all day
Where we are, Where we are
We sleep all day

Can you chase this fire away
Can you chase this fire away
In the fall we sleep all day
In the fall we sleep all day

La, la la la la la la la la la la la la... Songwriter(s):
