Song:

I want to break free
I want to break free,
I want to break free from your lies,
You're so self satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, god knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time,
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love
God knows, god knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true,
Yeah!
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure, when I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without,
Living without, living without you, by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see?
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free
