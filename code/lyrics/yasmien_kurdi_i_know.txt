Song:

I don't need to own a fancy car
To drive with you around the city
I don't need to live in a palace-like house
A simple home is enough for me

Refrain 1:
I don't need much
Only your attention
I had to hold
To make me feel that I am not alone

Chorus 1:
I know
With you my life is worth living
I know
Whit you my life is gonna be just fine
I know you each day begins with a smile
With you each day begins with a smile

I don't really have to worry
That some things won't workout for me
I don't really have to bother
Just as long as you here with me

Refrain 2:
I don't need much
Only your affection
To see me through
To make me feel that I am not alone

Chorus:
I know
Together we can make our dreams come true
I know
That through the years we won't be growing old
I know
Counting stars won't be so hard to do

There will be our lowest times
At the end of the tunnel shine
Our love for each other never fails
Baby I just know
(I know)
I know
(I know)
I know... Wooahh...
I know
(I know)
I know
(I know)
Wooahh...

I don't need much
Only your affection
To see me through
To make me feel that I am not alone
