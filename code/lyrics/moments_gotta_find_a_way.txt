Song:

I gotta find a way, I gotta find a way
I gotta find a way, I gotta find a way
I gotta find a way, I gotta find a way

[ Attention ladies and gentlemen!
Flight 214 is now boarding at gate 12.
For New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,
Richmond, Atlanta and Miami. ]

I rushed right over
Just as soon as I read
(Her letter)
Her letter,

And ohh, I don't know if there's still enough time
Left for me
(To get her,)
To get her.

Because my baby is already standing in line
There's not enough time for me to change her mind

But I...
(Gotta find a way to get us back together)
Gotta find a way, show me
(Gotta find a way to get us back together)
Ohhh, I gotta find a way, yeah
(Gotta find a way)
Gotta find a way
Hey, hey, hey
(Oooohhh)

[ Last call for Flight 214
For New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington,
Richmond, Atlanta and Miami.
All aboard please... ]

Gotta get a ticket
Gonna get that seat
Right next to her
Right next to my baby
I wanna show that girl
I wanna be true and I'm gonna do my very best for her
Yeah...

I know I've caused her
So much heartache and pain
(I'm the one to blame)
But I wanna change

Now I...
(Gotta find a way to get us back together)
Gotta find a way, some how
(Gotta find a way to get us back)
(Together, together, together, together)
Ohhh, I gotta find a way, yeah
(Gotta find a way)
Gotta find a way
Some how
(Oooohhh)

[ Welcome aboard Flight 214
Will you please fasten your seatbelt and observe the
" No Smoking " sign. ]

(Gotta find a way to get us back together, ohhh)
(Gotta find a way to get us back)
(Together, together, together, together)

(Gotta find a way to get us back together, ohhh)
(Gotta find a way to get us back)
(Together, together, together, together)
