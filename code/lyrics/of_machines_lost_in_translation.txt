Song:

This is your way out of space
A fool to fall for that line
For those who hoped
You'd be everything
(Be everything)

Your quiet eyes won't sleep tonight
This is a message to the weak
And now we know,
Just who you are
Yeah,
We've all caught on

And now you're on
And now you're on

Your words run so well together
You have lost your touch,
In those you cannot trust
This is your way out of here
Girl, you need to listen up
Before I let you go

Attention!
We have stolen the hearts
Of the machines

Attention!
We have stolen the hearts

And you find yourself
So confined by those who point at you
Tear down these weights
Give it all
Just let this go

For all the times you just stood there and stared
Into my stained glass eyes
And now and now we've come to understand what makes a man a man.

Your words run so well together
You have lost your touch,
In those you cannot trust
This is your way out of here
Girl, you need to listen up
Before I let you go

Girl, you need to listen up
Before I let you go
