Song:

So I got in the car
We drove for a mile
I didn't even learn her name
She said: "You've got the money and I've got the time"

Five years later on
She became my lover
Taught me everything I know
She said: "You were born to fly my son"
I said: "Hey! I already know"

Because it's all inside
Because it's all inside
I was born to fly, fly pretty high

Five years later on
She became my father
Taught me everything I know
She said: "You were born to burn my love"
I said: "Hey! I already know"

Chorus x2

So waste your time
On people who don't know which way to go
They'll never said you were, never said
You were up in the sky
Because it's all in the mind

Just get in the car
Turn out the light
Don't care who you are
You could be a star
Or you could be a fool
Don't care what I find
It's All In The Mind
