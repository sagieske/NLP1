Song:

In spite of all the consequence
In spite of all my pride
In spite of little things you said,
That hurt me deep inside

I believed your love,
I believed your love,
Like the air, in the morning
I sleep your love,
I salute your love
And I can't get away

Baby when the lights go out,
I hear you calling,
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out,
I need you,

Baby when the lights go out,
I hear you calling,
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out,
I need you.

The lights of all you see,
You could have overcome all this,
And I still can't get over you,
Are you someone I'll forever miss,

I believed your love
I can feel your love
And that's all that I wanted
I sleep your love
I salute your love
And I can't get away

Baby when the lights go out,
I hear you calling,
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out,
I need you,

Baby when the lights go out,
I hear you calling,
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out,
I need you.

And there's the dark, begins to rain
The sound is heavy on me

Baby when the lights go out
I need you

Under your spell I wanna be under your touch
Under your spell I wanna be under the rush

Baby when the lights go out

Baby when the lights go out

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out
I need you

Baby when the lights go out
I hear you calling
I hear you calling
Baby when the lights go out
I need you
