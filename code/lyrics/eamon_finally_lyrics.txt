Song:

Wake up and I'm feelin right, hop outta bed and I grab a bite, break up a fatty and roll it
Tight, thinkin what I'm gonna do tonight
Knew that she was feelin me, and I was feelin her like xtasy, next thing you know she was
Next to me, by the morning time she's sexin me

See finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been smokin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been fuckin

Check the mailbox and I got my check, sit back relax as I sip my Becks think about all the s**t I
Can gets
So I spend and spend til I think I'm set
Hit the club and I'm feelin nice, let me get the bottles and the ice, when I come through you
Know staten types, everyone I brought gets laid tonight

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been livin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been drinkin

And so the day has come just as quick the day goes by I still know I gotta try leave the
Bullshit far behind, even if that feelins lost, I'll make sure that it was found on my
Grounds, I'll be crowned, ain't goin down

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been fuckin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been livin

Everytime you see me I'll be smilin, with my boys on staten island, phillys and lots a
Chicks, we havin fun tonight

Everytime you see me I'll be smilin, with my boys on staten island, phillys and lots a licks,
We f****d up feelin right

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been smokin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been drinkin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been fuckin

Finally I can say everything today is gone my way
No problems, no hassles I been livin

Smokin, drinkin, livin, laughin, fuckin, buggin, lovin, singin, spendin, chillin
