Song:

[sample: "The wizard..."]

He left the northern hills to seek his fortune
A lone barbarian with only death lust to guide
He carved a kingdom of stone
King Conan, sitting on his bloody throne

His black mane sweeps across his face
Grim and silent with a steely blue gaze
Like a panther ready to strike
His blade crashes down to end your life

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
??
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand

Master swordsman of Hyborian Age
His name is legend to this very day
Even gods cower when his sword is unleashed
Nothing dare face him, neither man or beast

Cut a bloody swathe across this battlefield
Red mist rising, break your human shield
Slashed to pieces is to be your fate
Unleash berserker rage none shall escape

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
??
You think you're civilized, but you'll never understand

You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You think you're civilized, but you will never understand
You'll never understand
