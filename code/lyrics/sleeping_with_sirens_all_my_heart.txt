Song:

There's so many things that I could say,
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong.
You've got something that I can't explain,
Still I try and try and let you know.

The first summer we spent, one will never forget,
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess that
We thought was what made us.
Ain't it funny now, we can see,
We're who we're meant to be.

You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.
(Ohhhh)

There's too many times I have to say,
I could have been better and stronger for you and me.
You always make me feel okay.
Those late summers we spend stay up talking all night,
I'd ask, "You think we'd ever make it?"
You say, "I'm sure, if it's right."
Ain't it funny to think just how stupid I used to be,
Hope you always believe.

You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.

Let them talk and talk and talk,
Let them say what they want,
We will laugh at the thought they don't know what we got.
Every year that goes by, a year older we are.
You'll still be beautiful then, bless your beautiful heart.

We'll talk and talk and talk,
How crazy is it.
Someone could waste their whole life helplessly,
Just patiently waiting for a love like you and me.
(For a love)

You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.

You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.

You still have all of my,
You still have all of my,
You still have all of my heart.
