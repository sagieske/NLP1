Song:

Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got
Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot.
Wouldn't you like to get away?

Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came.
You wanna be where you can see, our troubles are all the same
You wanna be where everybody knows your name.

You wanna go where people know, people are all the same,
You wanna go where everybody knows your name.
