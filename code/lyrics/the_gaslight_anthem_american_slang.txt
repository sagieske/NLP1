Song:

Look what you started,
I seem to be coming out of my skin
And look what you've forgotten here
The bandages just don't keep me in

And when it was over, I woke up alone
And when it was over, I woke up alone

And they cut me to ribbons and told me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
And I called for my father but my father had died
Oh, while you told me fortunes in American Slang

And look at the damage,
The fortunes came for the richer men.
While we're left with gallows,
Just waiting for us liars to come down and hang.

And when it was over, I woke up alone
And when it was over, I woke up alone

And they cut me to ribbons and told me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
And I called for my father but my father had died
Oh, while you told me fortunes in American Slang

And here's where we died that time last year,
And where the angels and devils meet.
And you can dance with the queen if you need,
And she will always keep your cards
Close to her heart
Oh, so close to her heart
Before they tear you apart

Well, they cut me to ribbons and told me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
And I called for my father but my father had died
Oh, oh, we called for our fathers but our fathers had died
Oh, while you told us fortunes in American Slang
Oh, you told me fortunes in American Slang
