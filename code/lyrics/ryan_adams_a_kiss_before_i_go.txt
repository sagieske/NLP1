Song:

The engine turns on a dime
But I ain't goin' nowhere, tonight
I ain't been goin' nowhere for quite awhile
Can't tell the truth in a house of lies
Can't explain what I don't know
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go

One more kiss 'fore I go
One more night and day
Breath all heavy and slow
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go

I'll miss those nights at the bar
With every girl all loaded like freights
And the pain in the morning comes as easy as it goes
Can't find the truth in a house of lies
And you can't see tomorrow with yesterday's eyes
One shot, one beer and a place where nobody cries
One more kiss 'fore I go
One more night and day
Breath all heavy and slow
One shot, one beer and a kiss before I go
