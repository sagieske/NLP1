Song:

Alberta let your hair hang low
I saw her first on an april morn'
As she walked through the mist in a field of hay
Her hair lit the world with it's golden glow
And the smile on her face burned my heart away

Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

I thought my golden time would last
But the field of hay was soon cut down
In a short few weeks it all was past
And my golden girl just a painful song

Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
My heart is so sad 'cause you treat me so bad
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta let your hair hang low
