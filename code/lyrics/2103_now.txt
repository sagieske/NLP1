Song:

She was like
Looking at me
With those eyes
Looking right though me
Reading every page of me
Everything from a migrane I had
To the very last situation bad.
But that's mama
She can do that
She has powers and intution(its true)
I could never get anything past her if I wanted to
I told her I was dealing with this thing
I told her I was dealing with some pain
But she's not one of those mamas
Like tell this just tell that
She said don't you believe in God
There's no poblem that's hard
Baby can't mama can't help you through it
Talk to your father, tell him to do it
(Chrous)Seems like my clock is broken
Even then it's right twice a day
Being in this holding pattern.
Fighting with emotions, What's the matter
You are my souce, my strenght, my sword, my shield.
Lord the miracle I need is right now.
Now(5x)
Lord the miracle I need is right now.
Now(5x)
She was like blowin up my cell phone.
Back to back 911 it's on
Pick it up and I say what's goin on.
And a real strong voice says come home.
But that's daddy, he and mama they been talkin
So he called me and now I'm double-teamed on a three way call.
And I'm going to lose
Don't you believe in God
There's no problem that's hard
Baby mama and daddy can't help you through it
Talk to your father, tell Him to do it.
(Chorus)Seems like my clock is broken
Even then it's right twice a day
Being in this holding pattern.
Fighting with emotions
What's the matter
You are my source, my strenght, my sword, my shield.
Lord the miracle I need is right now.
Now(5x)
Lord the miracle I need is right now.
Now(5x)
