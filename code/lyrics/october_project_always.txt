Song:

I have come to know you
Over all these years
We've seen many days come and go
After all the time we've shared
All the secrets told
Will you ever say I love you
If you gave me nothing
Nothing more than this
I would have the mem'ry to keep
Let me make this simple wish
As we fall asleep
Let me wake with you by my side
Always
If you have to leave me
Leave me with a kiss
Tell me how you feel without words
Are you so afraid to stay
Must you be alone
Let me wake with you by my side
Always
