Song:

Oh you never know, 
Oh you never know
what the punks might say so better shut them up
Oh you never know, 
Oh you never know
what the punks might do so better lock them up
but I've got some uncut news for you

(Chorus)
Hey,if you don't change, 
if you cling to your properties
gotta change,
what you see as your foundation
better change, 
cause I'll be in your face and
I got a 5-inch gun in my mouth, 
so dive motherfucker

we are behind you in this case,proceed,
chain them to the aircraft and sample their urine
ha ha ha,yes yes of course, 
yes yes certainly 
strap them to the fence and spray them with cold water
and for gods sake give them a 24hour bedside lamp

(Chorus)
But, hey if you don't change
if you cling to your properties
gotta change,
what you see as your foundation
better change, 
cause I'll be in your face and
I got a 5-inch gun in my mouth, 
so dive motherfucker

change
better change (x2)
gotta change
better change (x2)
'cus if you don't change
better change
I said 
dive motherfucker (x4)
