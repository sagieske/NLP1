Song:

It's dry, it's dusty, the nights are long and cold
Your life is like a desert, you're scared of growing old
You can hear the clock ticking like a hammer on a stone
Remember this - you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone...
Come on! Can you hear it?
The call of the wild
Stand up now and fight back
Wipe off their plastic smiles
You crawled out of the ocean, your pulse was slow and weak
Got up on your two legs, put on clothes and learned to speak
Ended up abandoned in a place that they call home.
Remember this - you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone....
Come on! Can you hear it?
The call of the wild
Stand up now and fight back
Wipe off their plastic smiles
Why listen to the losers, who still treat you like a child?
Better find another station
Tune in to the call of the wild
The call of the wild
Call of the wild
Call of the wild...
They'll tell you that they love you, like the spider loves a fly
Promise you you're safe but never look you in the eye.
Manipulated, regulated, crippled and controlled.
Remember this - you're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone....
Come on! Can you hear it?
The call of the wild
Stand up and fight back
And kill their plastic smiles
Why listen to the losers, who still treat you like a child?
Tune in to the call of the wild
Call of the wild...
