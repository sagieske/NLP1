Song:

Smiles, all smiles
Like the sweet light of the sunrise
I'm in love with something in your smile
All smiles, waiting for the love you give me
When you do I just can't help but smile

You never have to she'd a tear
Just remember that I'll always care
And when I am old, I'll see you smiling there

When I'm sad you're the only one who cheers me
Let me see that heaven in your smile
