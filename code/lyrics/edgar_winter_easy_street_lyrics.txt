Easy Street

Saturday night at the corner cafe,
Had me some drinks and I'm feelin' my way,
Moon's on the rise and it looks like a night for romance.........

Shufflin' down past the local hotel,
Doin' the rounds like I'm under a spell,
Must be the place,
Yes I knew when she asked me to dance.........

I'm on Easy, Easy Street.........
I'm on Easy, Easy Street.........

Seein' as how I'm a regular guy,
Watchin' the girls of the evening go by,
Got me a chance so I'm takin' it, makin' it last.........

I'm on Easy, Easy Street.........
I'm on Easy, Easy Street.........

So if you're feelin' like you're a lonely man,
And when ever you are down and need a gentle hand.........
There's always Easy Street you know you got it planned,
But just remember boy,
It's only a one night stand.........

That's all.........

Think I'll make it anyway.........

That's where it's at.........

Easy Street usa.........
