Song:

Verse 1
I open my eyes, testify, thanking you for life
I lay down my head, tears I shed, thinking bout the price.

Everyday, that I pray, I wanna be closer to you
I need you Lord, I cling to your word, Lord please hear me

Chorus
I just wanna be
Who you want me to be
Oohh Lord use me
And make me be who you want me to be

Verse 2
So many times I failed, walk through the trail, then I changed my mind
I'm nothing without you, my life would be untrue, without you by my side

So I cried, Lord change me, I wanna be closer to you
I need you Lord, I know your word, please forgive me

Chorus
I just wanna be
Who you want me to be
Oohh Lord use me
And make me be who you want me to be

Bridge
I just wanna be, who you want me to be, Lord please use me
Sanctify me Lord, consecrate me Lord, for your glory

Chorus (2x)
