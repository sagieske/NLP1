Song:

Lois:
Brian, your standards are ridiculously high.
You will never find a girl unless you're willing to make exceptions
And compromise so you can find your love.

Brian:
Lois, I don't think I have to compromise a thing.
I'd rather be alone than with someone who doesn't get me.
Oh and how long has the coffee been on the burner in the kitchen?
I could really use a cup about now.

Lois:
Oh it's not very fresh. You see I meant to make more
But I made the mistake of getting caught up watching Oprah
She had on James Garner

Brian:
James Garner, what's he plugging?

Lois:
I don't know; some crappy movie on tnt.
