Song:

Just an every day man a few nights ago
Saw this beautiful lady that I scarely know
I don't know where she come from
But I know where she's been
Something in thoses big green eyes said to me
Baby won't you come on in, yeah

And tho the sun was rising I couldn't let myself go
Something she showed me put a hold on me so
But I ain't had this feeling since I don't know when
Falling in love was the last thing on my mind
Start all over again

I know what happened to me long time ago
I know the feeling just thrills me so
It's like the first time I walked on in the moonlight
The first time you ever touch a rose
The first time in a long time that everything was alright
What happens now nobody knows
Anything goes

The sun was rising I couldn't let myself go
Something she showed me put a hold on me so
But I ain't had this feeling since I don't know when
It's like the first time walking in the monlight
The first time you ever touched a rose
The first time in a long time everything is alright
What happens now nobody knows
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
