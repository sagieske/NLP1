Song:

[Hook:]
Have you ever seen a drop top hummer
I pull up that s**t would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I'ma give her some nice amber fall
You can't dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you'll never go
I'ma give her so nice amber fall

[Hook:]
Have you ever seen a drop top hummer
I pull up that s**t would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I'ma give her some nice amber fall
You can't dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you'll never go
I'ma give her so nice amber fall

Cop a 83 with the big tires
I got money that will never expire
Took a chance and I became a higher
Who can do what I do, no rival
It's just me and all my benjamins
Y'all start right, you need to experience this
4 b*****s at once, try that's an experiment
Then I don't wanna be nowhere but inside this music bizz
I worth it work flip the work and bought me a big crib
I could make the first down to first song the bottom of my list
Talking piss poor, broke when you start thinking you ain't s**t
And then you make some millions of a planet that don't exist

[Hook:]
Have you ever seen a drop top hummer
I pull up that s**t would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I'ma give her some nice amber fall
You can't dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you'll never go
I'ma give her so nice amber fall

Don't mention even be explained
B***h I rep that rich game
Cause your mouth pissin you can't go far
You know what it's like to roll with a star
I know open doors I can get you chauffeur
We can drive around I don't touch the wheel
I put swag on you and you taking off, outta here
I got diamonds chains and they put up like souvenirs
I don't know what to do with money but to stack it up
Came a long way from watching up for the ups drugs
I just seen on drawn the package it's on the porch
I'm just doing my exercise, finessing the sport

[Hook:]
Have you ever seen a drop top hummer
I pull up that s**t would scare your mama
They say you go crazy when you get lonely
But I got lama and it make me hungry
I'ma give her some nice amber fall
You can't dictate the way I move no more
Take your places you thought you'll never go
I'ma give her so nice amber fall.
