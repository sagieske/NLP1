Song:

I just got your letter, baby
Sayin' that you you can't come home
I think I'm goin' crazy
Sittin' here all alone
Since you gone away, I got a mess of blues

I been drinkin' since last Sunday
I ain't ate a thing all day
Every day is Blue Monday
Since you've been gone away
Since you gone away, I got a mess of blues

Whoops there goes a tear drop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
Sure ain't no disgrace

I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next thing going
I'm gonna leave my blues behind
Since you gone away, I got a mess of blues

Whoops there goes a tear drop
Rollin' down my face
If you cry when you're in love
Sure ain't no disgrace

I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next thing going
I'm gonna leave my blues behind
Since you gone away, I got a mess of blues
Since you gone away, I got a mess of blues
