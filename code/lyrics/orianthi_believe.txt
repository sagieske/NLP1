Song:

You made it so easy to fall I had no fear at all
I saw you beside me you never saw me there at all
I promised you all this
I made plans thinking this was it
But never imagined
I'd find you and lose myself instead
I just never pictured it would end

And I, I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us (the two of us)
And I, I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again

I picked up the pieces
And put them back where they belonged
But something's missing
But part of me will carry on
Yeah, I'm gonna learn to trust again

And I, I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us (the two of us)
And I, I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again

And I, I wanna believe in love
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us
And I, I wanna breathe again
I wanna go back to the days
The days I had my innocence
I wanna believe again (I wanna believe)
I wanna believe again (I wanna believe)
I wanna believe again
