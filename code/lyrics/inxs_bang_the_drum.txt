Song:

Bang The Drum (4:42)
(A. Farriss/M. Hutchence)

Hey,
Recognize what you want when it speaks to you
I know there's nothing so rare as a dream come true
We've all seen both sides of the same face, called them friend
Oh baby, grab a noose cause we're looking for a different end

If tomorrow comes and you feel undone, don't let your fears mess with number one
Better bang that drum, bang the drum

Hey,
You know what you want and I want you too
Yeah, yeah... Like a man on board with a ship of fools
I could burn up, I could burn up in an endless sky
Gotta stop, stop, stop! The fear you're faking, if you think I'm faking

Well if tomorrow comes and you feel undone, don't let your fears mess with number one
Better bang that drum, bang the drum

Better bang the drum...
Live by the rules of rythm, live by the rules of rythm...

Break it down

Bang the drum
Bang the drum
Give me...
Give me, give me your soul
Give me your soul
Give me...
Gotta Kick that can, yeah...

I'm burnin'... I'm burnin'...
Yeah burnin' like a star turned on
Give protection to the weak from the strong

If tomorrow comes and you feel undone, don't let your fears mess with number one
Better bang that drum, bang the drum (x2)

Break it down

Bang the drum, bang the drum
Bang the drum, bang the drum
Bang the drum, bang the drum
Bang the drum, bang the drum

If tomorrow comes and you feel undone, don't let your fears mess around with number one
Better bang that drum, gotta bang the drum
