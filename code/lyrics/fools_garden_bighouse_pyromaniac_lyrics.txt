Song:

We've got a big house
And the speaker says
That there's no explaination.
We've got a big house
And we don't wanna live inside no more.
We've got a big house
And the whole whole world
Has heard this detonation.
We've got a big house
And we don't know
Where it is - what it is.

You say - today
I don't wanna work it out.
Sorry - no way
I don't wanna work it out.
My mind is clear
And I wanna shout it out.
Hey, can you feel the explosion?

Hey, how? I don't know what it is.
Hey, how! We celebrate this...

We've got a big house
And the speaker says
That there's no explaination.
We've got a big house
And we don't wanna live inside no more.
We've got a big house
And the whole whole world
Has heard this detonation.
We've got a big house
And we don't know
Where it is - what it is.

Sorry!
Where do you go?
I always thought that you would like some action.
Sorry!
I didn't know,
You make me feel it was the wrong attraction.

We've got a big house
And we don't know,
We've got a big house
And we don't know
What it is!

Right now, I feel
I don't wanna work it out.
No doubt, it's real,
So why don't you shout it out.
Your smile is gone away.
Do you see the cloud
Of the explosion?

Hey, how? I don't know what it is
Hey, how! We celebrate this... Moment,
This moment (this moment).

Sorry!
Where do you go?
I always thought that you would like some action.
Sorry!
I didn't know,
You make me feel it was the wrong attraction.

We've got a big house
And we don't know,
We've got a big house
And we don't know
Where it is - where it is!
