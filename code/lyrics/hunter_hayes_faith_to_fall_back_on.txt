Song:

People know that love is what they want,
They get caught up and then it's gone
They can't get back the kiss they lost and
Spend their whole life asking questions,
Not knowing what went wrong

But, then the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta' have a little faith to fall back on
And then all that you've got left is being strong,
Gotta' find a little faith to fall back on

Didn't treat my girl like she was mine
Yeah, I thought I didn't need her at the time
But, I changed my way of thinkin' when she left
Yeah, I finally learned my lesson but, I learned it by myself

'Cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Gotta' have a little faith to fall back on

And then all that you've got left is being strong,
Gotta' find a little faith to fall back on

These days I'm not sure if I know
What I'm doing here or where I'll go
But, every night I say the same old prayer

"God, I don't have to see you. I know that you're there 'cause there were
Times I thought I wouldn't make it home but, I kept a little faith to fall
Back on. Yeah, and I've learned to put my trust where it belongs and
I've gotta' little faith to fall back on. "

'Cause when the answers that you know just prove you wrong,
Oh, you gotta' have a little faith to fall back on
Yeah, you gotta' be strong. Yeah, you gotta' be strong.
And find a little faith to fall back on.
