Song:

Ain't it funny, time goes by, you forget about your pain,
Find yourself, with someone else, fall in love again.

Ain't it good, so good, you and me, against the world
Ain't it good, so good, it's plain to see, it's you and me baby.

Spend your life, wasting time, always chasing something.
I found out what it's all about, I got my love for certain.

Ain't it good, so good, you and me, against the world
Ain't it good, so good, it's plain to see, it's you and me baby.

I used to be so lonely, I used to be so blue,
I had nothing, till I found you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ain't it good, so good, you and me against the world.
Ain't it good, so good, it's plain to see, it's you and me baby.

Ain't it good, so good, you and me against the world.
Ain't it good, so good, it's plain to see, it's you and me baby
