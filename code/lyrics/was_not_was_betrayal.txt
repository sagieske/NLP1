Song:

You can't think of what to say
When people talk to you
Oh no, now what will you do?
There's nothing new to chat about
So when in doubt drop a name
It never fails
Betrayal's just a game
Tell a secret on a friend
The facts will bend to suit your need
Disloyalty's your creed
Turn the knife a little more
What are friends for after all
When all else fails
Betrayal's just a game
Does it make you feel a little bolder
To stand on someone else's shoulder
Do you have to bring somebody down
To walk taller in this town
You told Jack and he told Steve
Steve told Gwen and they believe your lies
Aren't you proud?
You don't talk loud but your words shout
You're so easy to figure out
Betrayal's just a game
