Song:

I've been catching up on daydreams
I've been lost all afternoon
I've been imagining a future
In a world of only You
A world of only You

When the curtain falls down on me
I will be free
I will be free
When the curtain falls down on me
I believe
I will be free
Free

I get so stuck here in the shadows
Where it's hard to escape this gravity
This life is heavy now but I know,
Yes I know
That someday
Gravity's gonna lose it's grip on me

When the curtain falls down on me
I will be free
I will be free
When the curtain falls down on me
See I believe
I will be free
Free to fly-y-y away
I'm free to fly-y-y away

Well the show's not over, but I know how it ends
(I know how it ends)
When this dream
Becomes reality
It is no mystery
Where I will be

When the curtain falls down on me
I will be free
I will be free
When the curtain falls down on me
I will be free I will be free I will be
Free
When the curtain falls down on me
Well I believe
I will be free
Free to fly-y-y away
I'm free to fly-y-y away
Free to fly-y-y away
Free to fly-y-y away

Oh wow look at me now
Leaving the ground
Up in the clouds
So high
Up in the sky
It's time to fly

Fly-y-y away
I'm free to fly-y-y away
I'm free
To fly
