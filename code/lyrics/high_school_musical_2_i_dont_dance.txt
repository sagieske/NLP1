I'll show you that it's one and the same:
Baseball, dancing, same game.
It's easy:
Step up to the plate, start swingin.
(Chad) I wanna play ball now, and that's all.
This is what I do.
It ain't no dance that you can show me. yeah

(Chad) Oh I Know.

(Ryan) you'll never try.

(Chad)There's just one little thing that stops me everytime yeah.

(Ryan) Come on!

(Ryan) If I could do this, well, you could do that.

(Chad) But I don't dance.

Two-steppin, now you're up to bat.
Bases loaded, do your dance.

So you better spin that pitch you're gonna throw me, yeah.
