Song:

Sunday
Sunrise
Looking out across the bay
And in your eyes
I see all I want to say
And now you love me
The clouds above me
Couldn't stop the way I'm feeling

Together we are beautiful, I miss you

I see clearly
I am not afraid to fall
And with you near me
I can rise above it all
And now you love me
The clouds above me
Couldn't stop the way I'm feeling

Together we are beautiful, I miss you
