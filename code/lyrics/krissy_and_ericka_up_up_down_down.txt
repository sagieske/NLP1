Verse I:
One starry, starry night in July
Saw a shooting star fall from the sky
Even the rain fallin' on my head
Wish you'd fall for me instead

Shook the branches of an old oak tree
Leaves came fallen all over me

Bridge:
But what's the matter with gravity
Why won't it make you fall for me

Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down

Verse ii:
As the world turns round and around
Just about everything falls to the ground
The lizard on the ceiling fell on my bed
Wish you'd fall for me instead

I fell down the stairs
I fell down the tree
But it doesn't really bother me

Bridge:
But what's the matter with the gravity
Why won't it make you fall for me

Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down

(Instrumental)

Why won't it make you
Why won't it make you
Why won't it make you
Why won't it make you
Why won't it make you

Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
Up, up, down, down
