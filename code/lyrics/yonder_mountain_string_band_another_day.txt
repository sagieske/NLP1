Song:

When the rain is fallin' you can hear me callin'
Been gone so long that I wanna cry
In all the cities that I see, this open road has taken me
To another place far away from you

I close the door behind me and fall onto the bed
There's nothing on the tv and not much in my head
When I think of you it makes me smile and I realize
It's another day without you

Chorus:
Now wait for me little darling
I'm coming home, I hope you'll understand
I long for you little darling
Can't wait till I can see you again

And as the days turn into weeks
I'll call you when you're fast asleep
The air outside is cold enough to snow
In all the little towns I see
Another road has taken me
To some other place far away from you

The man behind the counter says room 225
I can't recall the place I'm in by the looks inside
And sure as every hotel looks the same I realize
It's another day without you

[ Chorus - x2 ]

Can't wait till I can see you again
