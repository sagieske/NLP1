Song:

When my work here is done
And my race has been won
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
When I've done my best
And withstood the ultimatetest
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me

Jesus went away
To prepare a place for me
And when He comes again
That's where I'll spend eternity

Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting

The time is growing nigh
When I must bid this world goodbye
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
The Lord is coming back
It's gonna be soon
And that's a fact
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me

Where the streets are made of gold
The gates are made of pearl
There'll be nothing but joy for me
When I leave this old world

Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
Heaven is waiting
I can't wait to get there
Heaven is waiting

I'll be free
From pain and misery
Free from hurt and strive
Going where there's no despair
And there I'll have new life

Trying to live right
Every day and every night
Cause heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
The Savior I will see
Gonna just bow down at His feet
My loved ones and frees
Who have gone on before
Are gonna be reunited
We'll live forevermore

Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
Heaven is waiting
I'm looking forward to going to heaven

Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting for me

I got to leave this old world
I can't stay down here yall
This old world is not my home
I'm just a stranger
I'm a stranger passing through
But one of these ole days
One of these ole days

Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Heaven is waiting
Don't you want to go (heaven is waiting)
Don't you want to go (heaven is waiting) (**continue to repeat after each line)
Is there anybody here tonight
Do you wanna go to heaven
Do you wanna go to heaven
Can you lay your burdens down
Gonna lay my burdens down
I'm going home to get my crown
I won't be crying no more
I won't be lied on no more

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
Going home

Don't you wanna go
Don't you wanna go
Don't you wanna go
Don't you wanna go

[Ending:]
Heaven is waiting for me
