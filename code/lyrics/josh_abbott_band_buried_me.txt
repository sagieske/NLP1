Song:

Verse 1
I really hate when you call me late at night.
I didn't answer cuz I didn't wanna fight.
Or hear you say things you don't mean, 
Drive my heart again down misery street

Chorus
Go ahead and arrange the flowers, 
And prepare my eulogy.
Call my brothers to be my pall bearers
Cuz what you did already buried me

Verse 2
When I think of you I get in my car, 
But I can never escape from where you are.
I can't forget the words that you said
The night you shot me in the heart and left me for dead

Bridge
Who am I kidding, I'll never be over you.
Put me ten feet deep so I won't face the truth
