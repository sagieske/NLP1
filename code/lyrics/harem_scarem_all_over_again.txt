Song:

(Hess)
Well, it was something that took me by surprise
Just when I tried to re-arrange my life
Well then I find out the things that I didn't really want to know
(No, it's not easy, you know it ain't easy)
Trying to get ahead in the world
All of a sudden it came over me and now I finally know
Even the hard times are good times
But I'd do it all over again
Even when I can't see what I've left behind me
I'd do it all over, do it all over again
Noticing now, there's some new things in my life
I try to turn them around, but it's too late to change my mind
(No, it's not easy, you know it ain't easy)
Trying to get ahead in the world
All of sudden it came over me and now I finally know
Chorus
