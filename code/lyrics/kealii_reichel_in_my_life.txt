[Foreign content]

There are places I remember, all my life
Though some have changed, some for ever, not for better
And some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments, with lovers and friends

I still can recall some are dead and some are living
But in my life I love them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compared with you
And these memories will lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Lord I know I'll never ever lose affection
For people and faith that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
But in my life, I've loved you more

Though I'll never ever lose affection
For people and faith that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
But in my life, I've loved you more
In my life, I love you more
