Song:

I've resisted You.
Like a wayward child, I thought I knew,
But like a loving Father, so faithful and so true
You have been waiting while I run from you.

Once I've tasted You,
Holy Spirit nothing else will do.
It's just like finding gold, when you've searched the whole world through!
For once I have found it I don't want to move.

I don't want to move,
From this holy, holy place
For too many times, I've resisted Your grace
I don't want to move,
From Your sweet embrace or the nearness of Your face,
I don't want to move from this holy place.

Fill me with new wine,
Holy Spirit come and let us dine!
For like the tender branch, all my life is in the vine!
So, all that I am, Lord, is no longer mine.

Bread of Life, so sweet,
Holy Spirit fill me and complete
The work that you have started and lay me at His feet.
Just worshipping Jesus, Bread of life so sweet!

I don't want to move,
From this holy, holy place
For too many times, I've resisted Your grace
I don't want to move,
From Your sweet embrace or the nearness of Your face,
I don't want to move from this holy place.

I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't want to move from this holy place
