Song:

People say it just doesn't matter but,
The Closer I Get, I'm giving in, I can't escape, damn what a shame.
Listen to me just for a minute,
I can be quick no gimmick, yeah.
I've got a plan we should live it.
The Closer I Get, I can relate,
This ain't our place, let us go far far away.
Find a new home, rules of our own, you and me both are the same.
Try to be strong, baby come on now, come on.
Lie after lie, so many times, when I try to find a peace of mind.
I've got love for you when the time gets rough
When all the stress adds up,
When you say "I've had enough".
Got love for, you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say "I've had enough".

Whatever happened to the good times?
We should create for ourselves, not rely on.
They'll never get a hold of me.
Simple you see, simplicity.
Yeah, the Closer I Get, I can relate, I can't escape, oh the pain.
I've been right all the time, still tryin' to find a peace of mind.
I've got love for you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say "I've had enough".
Got love for, you when the time gets rough.
When all the stress adds up,
When you say "I've had enough".
Yes I found my own way out,
I'm going all the way,
Until the people all find out,
Their going all the way down.
