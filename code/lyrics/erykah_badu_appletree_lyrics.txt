Erykah Badu - Appletree

I'd like to dedicate this to all the children
I have some food in my bag for you
Not the edible food the food you eat no
Perhaps some food for thought
Since knowledge is infinite
It has infinitely fell on me so um...
It was a stormy night you know the kind where the lightnin' strike
And I was hangin' out with some my yatzhee friends
Ooh wee ooh wee ooh wee
The night was long the night went on people coolin' out until the
Break of dawn
Incense was burnin' so I'm feelin' right, aight
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasin' me
Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, then you don't want to pick
From my
Apple tree x3
And if you don't want to be down, you just don't want to be down
I have a hoe
And I take it everywhere I go
Cause I'm plantin' seeds so I reaps what I sow, ya know, ya know
On and on, and on and on my cypher keep's movin' like a rollin' stone
I can't control the soul flowin' in me
Ooh wee ooh wee
See I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what ya got
I work at pleasin' me
Cause I can't please you and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree x3
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be
Down
Oh my my my my, oh my my my my, oh my my my my my my my
I picks my friends like I pick my fruit
My Ganny told me that when I was only a youth
I don't walk around trying to be what I'm not
I don't waste my time trying to get what you got
I work at pleasin' me
Cause I can't please you, and that's why I do what I do
My soul flies free like a willow tree
Doo wee doo wee doo wee
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, dum dum diddy
And if you don't want to be down with me, you don't want to pick from
My apple tree
And if you don't want to be down with me, you just don't want to be
Down
You just don't want to be down,
You just don't want to be down
