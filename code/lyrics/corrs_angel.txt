Song:

She lived like she knew nothing lasts
Didn't care to look like anyone else
And she was beautiful, so beautiful
I still hear her laugh like she's here
Shower it down on all the young
It isn't so wrong to have such fun

Forever angel
I hope they love you like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
(I'll be proud to be like you)

Does the sun shine up at you when you're looking down
Do you get along with the others around

It's got to be better than before
You don't need to worry now you're gone

Forever angel
I hope they love you like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
Just like you

And when I go to sleep at night
I'll thank you for each blessed thing surrounding me
For every fall I'll ever break
Each moment's breath I wanna taste
Confidence and conscience
Decadent extravangance
Never ending providence
F for loving when I had the chance

(Tin whistle interlude)

Angel
I hope they love you like we do
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Forever angel
I'll be proud to be like you
Be like you
I'll be proud to be like you
