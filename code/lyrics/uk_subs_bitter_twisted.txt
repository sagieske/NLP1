Song:

I'm so violent, I need mental guidance.
I'm so bitter over you.
I go out drinking, it stops me thinking.
I'm so twisted over you.

Get out of my way. I'm ok.
I'm just bitter over you.
F**k with me. You will see.
I'm all twisted over you.

I got you a blow fish sushi just to see you die.
I'm so bitter over you.
You got sick but you survived.
I'm so twisted over you.

Get out of my way. I'm ok.
I'm just bitter over you.
F**k with me. You will see.
I'm all twisted over you.

Your alimony came today. I'd rather die than pay.
I'm so bitter over you.
Put a gun to my head, pull the trigger and I'll be dead.
I'm so twisted over you.
