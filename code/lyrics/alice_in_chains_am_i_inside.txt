Song:

Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness
Crawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

Surrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used
And because so, once was mine
I walk this maze alone

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

Minds beside himself, Minds below himself
Minds behind himself, Am I inside myself

Chaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me

Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free

Minds beside himself, Minds below himself
Minds behind himself, Am I inside myself
