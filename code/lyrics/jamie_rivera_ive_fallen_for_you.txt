Song:

What is this I'm feelin'
I just can't explain
When you're near,
I'm not the same.
I'm tryin' to hide it,
Try not to show it.
It's crazy
How could it be

Chorus
I've fallen for you
Finally, my heart gave in
And I'm fallen in love
I fin'lly know
How it feels

When you said hello,
I looked in your eyes.
Suddenly, I felt good inside.
Is this really happ'nin?
Or am I just dreaming?
I guess, it's true.
I can't believe

I've fallen for you
Finally, my heart gave in.
And I'm fallen in love
I fin'lly know how it feels
So this is love...

Doesn't matter where I am,
Thoughts of you still linger in my mind
No matter what time of day
I've really, really
Fallen for you...

I've fallen for you Finally, my heart gave in.
And I'm fallen in love
I fin'lly know how it feels
So this is love..
