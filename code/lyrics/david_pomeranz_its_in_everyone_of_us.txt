Song:

It's in everyone of us
To be wise
Find your heart
Open up both your eyes,
We can all know everything
Without ever knowing why,
It's in everyone of us
By and by
It's in everyone of us
To be wise,
Find your heart
Open up both your eyes,
We can all know everything
Without ever knowing why,
It's in everyone of us
By and by

It's in everyone of us
I just remembered
It's like I been sleeping for years,
I'm not awake as I can be
But my seeing is better,
I can see
Through the tears,
I've been realising that,
I bought this ticket
And watching only half of the show,
There is scenery and lights
And a cast of thousands,
Who all know
What I know,
And it's good
That it's so

It's in everyone of us
To be wise
Find your heart
Open up both your eyes,
We can all know everything
Without ever knowing why,
It's in everyone of us
By and by,
It's in everyone of us
By and by
