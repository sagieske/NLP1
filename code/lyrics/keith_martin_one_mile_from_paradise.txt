Song:

Hmmmmmmm

Oh yeah.... Hmmmm yeah.... Ooohhh
She was only seventeen
Pretty young it seems for her dreams deceived
She was eager in love for sure
Everybody knows how the story was told
But it changed, she didn't know he need her so she walked away
When she should have stayed

[Chorus:]
She was only one mile from paradise
She was only one mile away
She was only one mile from paradise
The love was fine but it did not last, he sliped away

The pain of losing was much too bad
She should have shown how much she care
I would have given my life for her love
But I'm too far away from her foreign town
With all my heart convinced her I tried
But she walked away when she should have stayed

[Chorus:]
She was only one mile from paradise
She was only one mile away
She was only one mile from paradise
The love was fine but it did not last, he sliped away (hmmmm)
She was only one mile from paradise
She was only one mile away
She was only one mile from paradise
The love was fine but it did not last, he sliped away... Away... Away
She was only one mile from paradise
She was only one mile away
She was only one mile from paradise
The love was fine but it did not last, he sliped away away... Away... Yeah
She was only one mile from paradise
She was only one mile away
She was only one mile from paradise
The love was fine but it did not last, he sliped away away... Away...
Away... (fading)
