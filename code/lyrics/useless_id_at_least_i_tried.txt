Song:

How come first love always last a life time?
8 years ago. First time that I saw you.
Ever since then I had my yearly thought
Of how shy of me to never come and tell you that...

Many days that I remember sitting by the phone,
Crying and afraid to call you, knowing you're at home.
We're both alone and I can't help it.
How about I just wait one more monday...

It's a rainy day outside and it's colder on this bus.
I just saw you across the street, waiting.
Next stop I'm getting off to relive my 80's drama flick.
You are gone. Tommorrow I'll call in sick.

Many days that I remember sitting by the phone,
Crying and afraid to call you, knowing you're at home.
We're both alone andi can't help it.
How about I just wait one more monday...

I got a message you have someone.
Happy all the time.
No room for me this time around.
Let's get on with our lives.
I can go on from now and know that deep inside,
At least I tried.
