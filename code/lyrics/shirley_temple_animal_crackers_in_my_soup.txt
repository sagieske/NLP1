Lyrics/Music T.Koehler & I.Caesar/R.Henderson
Once Mother said My little pet
You ought to learn your alphabet
So in my soup I used to get
All the letters of the alphabet
I learned them all from A to Z
And now my Mothers giving me
------
Animal crackers in my soup
Monkeys and rabbits loop the loop
Gosh oh gee but I have fun
Swallowing animals one by one
In every bowl of soup I see
Lions and Tigers watching me
I make 'em jump right through a hoop
Those animal crackers in my soup
When I get hold of the big bad wolf
I just push him under to drown
Then I bite him in a million bits
And I gobble him right down
When their inside me where it's dark
I walk around like Noahs Arc
I stuff my tummy like a goop
With animal crackers in my soup
Animal crackers in my soup
Do funny things to me
They make me think my neighbourhood
Is a big menagerie
For instance there's our Janitor
His name is Mr Klein
And when he Hollers at us kids
He reminds me of a Lion

The Grocer is so big and fat
He has a big moustache
He looks just like a Walrus
Just before he takes a splash
