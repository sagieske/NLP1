Song:

The night is filled with love
Everything is far away
I'm trying to imagine you are mine
I must've found a million ways of fantasizing
I look up to an empty ceiling
But only memories are falling
Tangled in your sound of breathing
Like it was my life

And in my mind I hear your voice...

*CHORUS:
Say that everything we feel is all for something
Say I'm everything you're dreaming when you're dreamin'
Say that you won't let me go
Then tell me something
'Cause my heart says that you want me and you love me

I'm hiding 'cause it's safe that's the way it's going these days
And maybe I'm too fragile to laugh
It's always like I'm reaching the end or just pretending

While in my mind I hear your voice...
(Repeat Chorus)

You're the reason I've been suffering
You're the reason for my trusting
There is nothing that can stop me
When I'm reaching for you now

Say that stars can never blind us from these feelings
Say that nothing can be less than what were seeing
Say I'm always in your soul don't keep me guessing
'Cause my heart says that you want me
I know you love me
