Song:

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em

Hey pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?

Merry the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?

Are - you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing (yeah)
Are - you in
I am countin'!

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em

Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?

Lets' make a team
Make 'em say my name
Love in the extreme
Now are you game?

Are - you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing
Are - you in
I am countin'!

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothin' meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me...
Or three...
Or four...
- On the floor!

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves (oh)
Count em
