Song:

Play it all
Ten to one
Hit the pocket
Take a run

Night and day
I'm losing hours on this game
Risking to become
Insane

Flip a coin
Take your time
Make a choice for
Just a dime

Crazy mania
Rising fever in my brain
Ooh, what's a man to do
When the music's on the groove?

Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Bye-bye to the boy
It's got a hold
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy
Coming alive

Shoot the moon
Button down
Burning bridges
To the ground

Night and day
I'm losing hours in this place
Risking to forget
My face

Greedy box
Blinking light
Turning records
Rare delight

Crazy mania
Rising fever in my brain
Ooh, what's a man to do
When the music's on the groove?

Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Bye-bye to the boy
It's got a hold
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Coming alive
Coming alive

Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Bye-bye to the boy
It's got a hold
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy
Bye-bye to the boy-boy
Juke box boy

Bye-bye to the boy
It's got a hold
Bye-bye, boy-boy
Juke box, juke box, juke box boy
