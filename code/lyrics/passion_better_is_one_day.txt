Lead Worshipper: Charlie Hall
How lovely is your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and even fates for You
For here my heart is satisfied(is satisfied)
Within Your presence
As seen beneath the shadow of Your wing
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere(repeat)
(than thousands elsewhere)
One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells
My heart and flesh cry out
For You the living God
Your spirit 's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You - (to You)
Better is one day
Better is one day
Better is one day
Than thousands elsewhere
