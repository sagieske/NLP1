Song:

I hear a new sound on the sterio
I feel the beat from my head to my toes
Reminds me that wherever I go - I'm not alone
Summer, winter, spring, or fall
Come rain or shine you're there through it all
You're my hope when I'm ready to fall

All I know...

You & me that's what I'm saying
All my worries start fading
We're gonna make it
Come what may

Keep on moving
Don't let nothing get to you or slow you down
Life is full of twist and turns
But that's alright, that's alright
Keep on moving
Don't worry about what's next around the bin
Close your eyes
Enjoy the ride
Find a way
We're gonna make it
Come what may

The clouds are pushing back
I can see the sun
Bet it gets better when I'm having fun
Whatever I need you are enough
I'm not alone
So my arms are open wide
When I'm with you I think I can fly
You're the reason why I smile
All I know...

You & me that's what I'm saying
All my worries start fading
We're gonna make it
Come what may

Keep on moving
Don't let nothing get to you or slow you down
Life is full of twist and turns
But that's alright, that's alright
Keep on moving
Don't worry about what's next around the bin
Close your eyes
Enjoy the ride
Find a way
We're gonna make it
Come what may

Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Keep on moving
Come what may

Keep on moving
We keep on moving
Keep on moving
Come what may

Yesterday is dead and gone
So I choose - keep moving on
I know I'm not alone
With you I'm strong
Help me sing this song

Keep on moving
Don't let nothing get to you or slow you down
Life is full of twist and turns
But that's alright, that's alright
Keep on moving
Don't worry about what's next around the bin
Close your eyes
Enjoy the ride
Find a way
We're gonna make it
Come what may
(X2)

Don't let nothing get to you
Yeah, yeah
Don't let nothing slow you down
No, no
So let nothing get to you
Yeah, yeah
Don't let nothing slow you down
No, no
