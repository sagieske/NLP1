Song:

Here's to the one with the smoke instead
Running through my head with a bone all night
Chopping off the threads made off from lures
A love and love and hate, it's an empty tune

Ask, he will call in black and bare
Freaky little tunes hanging solo
Sock at the walls like a roll on now
Making a cocoon when my brain fails

I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take the room, I'm gonna break you
I gotta make my little fall take his own

I wanna go back, I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take the room, I'm gonna break you
I gotta make my little fall take his own

I've overgrown with the yellow mold
Just as it goes in a hollow dome
Might find the noise, you'll be little grown
I'm just so cold in the marrow of my bones

I look at you as you take us in
Your skinny legs dripping right through
I lift your chin, you grin as you
As you come through and I'm running around your head
With a bone all night

I'm gonna go back, I'm gonna go back
I'm gonna go back to a face, not a mask
I wasn't fooled until I met you
I'm gonna shake my feathers, I'm breaking loose

I'm gonna go back, I'm gonna go back
I'm gonna go back to a face, not a mask
I wasn't fooled until I met you
I'm gonna shake my feathers, I'm breaking loose
