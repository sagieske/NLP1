Song:

[Verse:]
I used to think humility was everything
The only way through to all sounds

[Pre-Chorus:]
I fought against the ego
I fought, fear by me closer to the truth
I fought against the ego
I knew it brought me closer to losin'

[Chorus:]
From first step to last
I'm? From the ashes
From first step to last
I'm tender to you

[Verse 2:]
I used to think that I was bound to reverence
The only way through to my help

[Pre-Chorus:]
I fell into the ego
I feel, it brought me closer to my youth
I fell into the ego
I knew it brought me closer to hybris

[Chorus: X2]
From first step to last
I'm? From the ashes
From first step to last
I'm tender to you
