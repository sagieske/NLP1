Song:

[Troy:]
Ya never know what you're gonna feel, oh
Ya never see it comin' suddenly it's real

[Gabriella:]
Oh, never even crossed my mind, no
That I would ever end up here tonight

[Both:]
All things change
When you don't expect them to
No one knows
What the future's gonna do
I never even noticed
That you've been there all along

[Chorus:]
[Troy & Gabriella:]
I can't take my eyes off of you
I know you feel the same way too, yeah
I can't take my eyes off of you
All it took... Was one look
For a dream come true

[Ryan:]
Yeah, we got a good thing goin' on

[Sharpay:]
Oh, right here is right where we belong

[Both:]
You never really know what you might find
Now all I see is you and I
You're everything I never knew
That I've been looking for

[Chorus:]
[Ryan & Sharpay]

[All:]
Can't take my eyes off of you
Oh, oh, oh yeah
So let the music play
Can't take my eyes off of you
Yeah, the feeling's getting' stronger
And I never ever felt this way

Alright, I see everything
In your eyes... Oh yeah
Alright, something's happening
Cause everyone's around but
You're the only one I see

[Chorus:]

I can't take my eyes off of you
Feelings like I never knew
I can't take my eyes off of you
From the start... Got my heart
Yeah, you do
Can't take my eyes off you
