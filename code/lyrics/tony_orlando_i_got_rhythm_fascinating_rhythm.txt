Song:

Days can be sunny, with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their day full of song
Why shouldn't we sing along?

I'm chipper all the day, happy with my lot
How do I get that way? Look at what I've got

I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies, in green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

Old man trouble
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

Old man trouble
I don't mind him
You won't find him, 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

I got rhythm, I got music
I got daisies, in green pastures
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?

Fascinating rhythm:

Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain
So darn persistent
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane
Comes in the morning
Without any warning
And hangs around me all day
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver

When a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver

Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a-hopping
Never stopping
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!
Fascinating rhythm
On won't you stop picking on me?
