A-[a] round me [e7] many are [a] building
[d] homes of beauty and [a] wealth
But [d] what of a home in [a] heaven
Where will you [e7] live after [a] death

Chorus:
Are you [d] building a home in [a] heaven
To live in when this life is [e7] oer
Will you [a] move to that [d] beautiful [a] city
And live with [e7] christ ever [a] more.

Long is the [d] road that leads [a] you
To that beautiful home up [e7] there
Is [a] work on your [d] home com-[a] pleted
Death may [e7] be lingering [a] near.

Are you ready [d] for his [a] coming
Have you been true all a-[e7] long
Have you [a] finished your [d] building in [a] glory
Will you move to this [e7] heavenly [a] home.
