Song:

Every note delivers me to somewhere else
Far from the world. I refuse to dwell
Autism, raptured rituals
Naked mind

Naked mind, open wide
Naked mind, cross the distant light
Cross the distant light

Frozen child I've become Addicted.
Don't you worry about me
I can walk all by myself

In comfort, come connect the lines
Something is missing
Something sacred to us
Others just taking advantage
It belongs to all of us
Make substantial tracks so we can ride smoother
We think that's what freedom is all about

Cut once and measure twice
Be sentimental in every movement

Me like it like it like this, we love
Let the culture mix all the color
Always we come together as one
Celebrate the sound of our time

Never surrender, fight prejudism
Never surrender, reach our dreams
