Song:

Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head, I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

Why worry now? You'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
