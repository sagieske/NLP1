Song:

Abduction is the way I start my day.
Finally all my planning has paid off.
Eager to dismember.
Your skin so sweet and tender.
Strapped to the chair.
Degrading you right to your face.
Gagged.
Puking all over the place.
It's time to finally shut you up.
Stabbing you viciously.
Watching your face was priceless.
Blood Splattered Satisfaction.
I dealt you away (repeat)
Good - Now your times up.
Preparation has paid off by - Never quitting.
Disposing of your body was a pleasure.
No one will ever find you.
I'm sure they will look hard - but only I know you're in my backyard
