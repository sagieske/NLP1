Song:

"Show me someone who makes a difference
Show me someone who's brave when he needs to be
I just need to see
Someone who cares enough that he would risk his life
For the love of what he's come to believe

But you say that a man like that wouldn't last in a world like this
Well I believe that the world won't last
If a man like that don't exist
So I'm looking for a few good men the brave and strong
Well I bow again Lord I pray "Thy Kingdom Come"

Show me a someone who knows how to struggle
Who isn't caught in the hold of his luxuries
I just need to see
Someone who was made for trouble
Who could come and help shape our destiny

But you say that a man like that wouldn't last in a world like this
Well I believe that the world won't last
If a man like that don't exist
So I'm looking for a few good men the brave and strong
Well I bow again Lord I pray "Thy Kingdom Come"

But you say that a man like that wouldn't last in a world like this
Well I believe that the world won't last
If a man like that don't exist
So I'm looking for a few good men, the brave and strong
Well I bow again Lord I pray "Thy Kingdom Come"

(Give me the strong give me the brave)
(Give me the strong give me the brave)
(Give me the strong give me the brave)
(Give me the strong give me the brave)

Though it come with a cross
Though it come with the pain let it come
Let it come to our hearts
Let it burn in our brains let it come
O Lord though it come with the blood that the
Martyrs bleed
Let it come oh Lord let it come
Let it come with the fury of a love unleashed let it come

(Give me the strong give me the brave)
Oh Lord let it come
(Give me the strong give me the brave)"
