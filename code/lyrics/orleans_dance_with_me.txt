Song:

Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is Falling, and I am Calling
Dance with me

Fantasy could never be so killing
I feel free, I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up, and kick your feet up
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes, and love is all around
I can take you where you want to go

Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is Falling, and I am Calling
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes, and love is all around
I can take you where you want to go

Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is Falling, and I am Calling
Dance with me

Dance with me

Dance with me

Dance with me
