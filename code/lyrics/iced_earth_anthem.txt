Song:

In your eyes I see your desperate and in hunger
Reclaim your future, your paths uncertain
See this child it's raised in hate and in anger
His eyes wide open, his rage so focused

Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life

The single mother she is strained and she suffers
She slaves away, her life in turmoil
The homeless man had it all and now has nothing
His spirit broken plagued from injustice

Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life

We have the power make our lives what they ought to be
Reconnect with our humanity
Transcend to a higher place, accepting reality
You are the key to the life you seek

Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
Torn asunder our destiny is in sight
This is the anthem to celebrate your life
