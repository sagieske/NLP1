(Kim Carnes)

The king of hearts has won the final inning
He's made his move and played his hand so well
Everyone thinks he's got it made
'Cause no one can tie him down
Everybody says he was a damn fool
For givin' me the run-around

All he did was tell me lies to try to woo me
After all the talk I guess he won the prize
He never meant to stay
How could be do it to me
Everybody says I was a damn fool
To listen to his run-around

Now I was tryin' to act just like a lady
I turned him down
Then he took me by surprise
Now who would have thought that a girl like me
Could be swayed so easily
Everybody says I was a damn fool
'Cause I gave what he took for free

All he did was tell me lies to try to woo me
After all the talk I guess he won the prize
He never meant to stay
How could be do it to me
Everybody says I was a damn fool
To listen to his run-around

The king of hearts can't play his game forever
And the jester's not the fool when the king is old
Later on will he think of me
When his castle walls get cold
Will he care to call
Will he caere at all

All he did was tell me lies to try to woo me
All he did was tell me lies to try to woo me
