Song:

I've always liked the wind
I stood tall and let it pass
Because I knew there would be silence after all
I was calm

I've always liked the water
All my life it ran through me
I could trust it, I knew I'd always float
And the tide would bring me home

You know I love you, and I always will
But you're like the strongest wind that never passes
You know I want you, And I always will
You're like the roughest sea, no tide to bring me home
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?

I've always liked the taste of danger
I've always let it challenge me
But inside there was a thin white line
I stayed safe within it's borders
I was fine

You know I love you, and I always will
Darker then my fears,
No safety net to catch us
You know I want you, And I always will
You go beyond, to where there is nothing
Left of me
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?
Who's too strong for who
Who's too weak for who

You know I love you, and I always will
But you're like the strongest wind that never passes
You know I want you, And I always will
You're like the roughest sea, no tide to bring me home
You know I need you and I always will
There's no good in this, all this holding on
You know I want you, And I always will
All this trying on my own, I am always on my own
You know I need you and I always will
Am I just too weak?
Or are you just too strong for me?
Who's too strong for who
