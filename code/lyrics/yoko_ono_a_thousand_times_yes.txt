Song:

I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,
I prayed a thousand times yes.
And the no that was hanging over the buildings
Faded like the moon at dawn.

When I was young I thought I was facing
A very aware world ahead,
I didn't know it was going to be
Beware of dogs instead.

I said no, I said no, I said no,
I said no a million times to no.
But the yes that was in its last breath
Still hovered in a room with a permanent flu.

When I was young I didn't know
That one can only read life in braille,
I was still struggling to catch life on its tail.

I said why, I said why, I said why,
I asked why for the billionth time.
And my bone slowly lost its moist
Like a leftover coke bottle on the street.

Yes, this dry whiteness of a thing on the square,
That's my bone.
It lets the wind pass over like the last tender fraud,
Makes a little noise like old campaign billboard.

I said yes, I said yes, I said yes,
I prayed a thousand times yes.
And the no that was hanging over faded.
