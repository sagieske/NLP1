Song:

Everywhere we go, we see you
We feel the energy you're giving back to us
We traveled many miles to be with you
And we will do it again just because

Because between us there's no distance
Even though we come from many worlds apart
It really doesn't make a difference
Anyway, anyhow where we are, oh, oh

Being here with you this way reminds us of a place

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
London, Paris, Rome, it feels like
Anywhere usa, it never feels too far away from home
From home, oh, anywhere

Everybody's got a problem
Let's get together, raise the roof right off this house
We speak a language, it's the same one
Isn't that what it's all about

Being here with you this way reminds us of a place

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
London, Paris, Rome, it feels like
Anywhere usa, oh, it never feels too far away from home
From home, oh

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
New York, Tokyo, it feels like
Anywhere usa, it never feels too far away from home

Do what we're saying when the girl is playing
Keep it moving so you never wanna stop
This is what we have together oh, can't get no better
Anywhere is home when you've got what we've got

Anywhere, anywhere
Anywhere, anywhere usa

Where to in Tokyo or New York city
Canada, there is Miami
We raise the roof we're P. Y. T.
Rock and roll, we're all family

Anywhere is room, you got what we got
Kick back and relax until we hit your spot
Boston, D. C., L. A. And Baylein, Bombay
Anywhere usa

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
London, Paris, Rome, it feels like
Anywhere usa, it never feels too far away from home

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
New York, Tokyo, it feels like
Anywhere usa, it never feels too far away from home

Anywhere usa, no matter where we go
New York, Tokyo, it feels like
Anywhere usa, it never feels too far away from home
