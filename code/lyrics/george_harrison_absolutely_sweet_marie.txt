Song:

(can you handle another guitar hero?
Let me give you a little clue:
Hallelujah, hare krishna, yeah yeah yeah !
George harrison!)

Well, your railroad gate, you know I just cant jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
Im just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet marie?

Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet marie?

Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.

Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finlly delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
Well, where are you tonight, sweet marie?

Well, I dont know how it happened
But the river-boat captain, he knows my fate
Evrybody else, even yourself
Just gonna have to wait.

Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The persian drunkard follows me
And I can take him to your house but I cannot unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Yeah, where are you tonight, sweet marie?
Yeah, where are you tonight, sweet marie?
