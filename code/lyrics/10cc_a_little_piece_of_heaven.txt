Song:

There's a little piece of heaven in your eye today
I think I saw it comin' but I really couldn't say
But if it turns into a teardrop on your cheek today
Will it turn into a river before I wipe it away
And when we're apart (And when we're apart) I feel so alone (Feel so alone)
And the mystery man (It's a mystery man) moves into our home (Home)
And takes our little piece of heaven
Our little piece of heaven
Our little piece of heaven
There's a little piece of heaven in the world today
I think I saw it comin' but I really couldn't say
But if it turns into a teardrop on your cheek today
Will it turn into a river by the end of the day
Never fought on my own
I had too much pride
Couldn't make it alone
I want you at my side to share our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
A little piece of heaven of our own (Heaven)

And when we're apart (And when we're apart) I feel so alone (Feel so alone)
And the mystery man (It's a mystery man) moves into our home (Home)
And takes our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven
Our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven will be gone (Little piece of heaven)
Our little piece of heaven

Our little piece of heaven, our little piece of heaven

Our little piece of heaven, our little piece of heaven
Our little piece of heaven will be gone

Our little piece of heaven will be gone
