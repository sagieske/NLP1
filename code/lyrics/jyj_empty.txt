Song:

Girl, I swear
I'm never going through this again
I know that you thought you'd win
And before I give you another try
I'd die

Love won't make you cry or ask why
Oh why
So I'll deny my heart cause
I won't live a lie
Why try

Your heart is empty
And you're so cold
You don't care about you and I
Your heart is empty
You won't let go
But I'm walkin' out this life

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl, because your heart is empty

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl, because your heart is empty

There you go
Tryna tell me how to be a man
When that's something you just
Don't understand
It's time to bring your
Truth to light
No lie

Love won't make you cry or ask why
Oh why
So I'll deny my heart cause
I won't live a lie
Why try

Your heart is empty
And you're so cold
You don't care about you and I
Your heart is empty
You won't let go
But I'm walkin' out this life

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl because your heart is empty

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl because your heart is empty

Your heart is gone
My heart is strong
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Your heart is gone
My heart is strong
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Your heart is empty (empty, empty)
Your heart is empty (empty, empty)
Your heart is empty (empty, empty)

Girl because your heart is empty

Your heart is empty
And you're so cold
You don't care about you and I
Your heart is empty
You won't let go
But I'm walkin' out this life

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl because your heart is empty

Why can't you let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Let it go,
Girl because your heart is empty
