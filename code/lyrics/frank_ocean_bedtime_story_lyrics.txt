Song:

My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby

You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story
Oh

I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on the ceiling to count
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby

You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story
Oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you
Baby I, I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, I'm thinking of you
Baby I, I'm thinking of you

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream
Baby you're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
My bedtime story, bedtime story
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words in my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you
I love you
