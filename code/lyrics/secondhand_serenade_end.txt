Song:

Now that summer's over
We'll wonder what to do
We'll finish our last nights in your car
Just like we always do.

I'll hold you closer and tell you I love you
But it won't matter in the end
It's obvious you're leaving soon
Just another heart to mend

So what happens once you lose control?
When the future has to start
What happens when you're still in love
But time rips you apart.
Is there ever an answer
For when love is not enough?
When the world must move on
Who decided that I'd be that tough.

The day before those dreaded goodbyes
And kisses concealing the night,
I lie in bed motionless
Hoping somehow my life will be alright

So what happens once you lose control?
When the future has to start
What happens when you're still in love
But time rips you apart.
Is there ever an answer
For when love is not enough?
When the world must move on
Who decided that I'd be that tough.

It's raining as we close our eyes
Knowing soon we must let go
I loved another with my life...
But with time as my enemy, now I'll never know.

The end proves I can't do this
Alone
