Song:

Don't you ever wonder
Where all your happy thoughts have gone?
In case

You don't remember
We were peter pans for a day,
You say it's all in a day's work,
But days will turn into

Weeks
And on an on we go till we just forget.
We forget

There goes your world on a train
Catch it

Cause it's making it's last trup

Time don't take it away, don't take it away, don't take it all

Away

When we move to the left, then we move to the right
Forward and then backward till the moment's gone we

All fade away
Spin around we don't make a sound time keeps moving on
Until your moment's gone, we all fade

Away

We can't be young forever, but that's what old men say
Just try to remember we were john and wendy

Yesterday
There goes your world on a train catch it cause it's making it's last trip

Time don't take it

Away, don't take it away, don't take it all away

When we move to the left, then we move to the

Right
Forward and then backward till the moment's gone we all
Fade away

Spin around we don't make a

Sound time keeps moving on
Until your moment's gone, we all fade away
Do you recall when Saturday mornings were

Meant for fun

Do you remember, when it all went away?
