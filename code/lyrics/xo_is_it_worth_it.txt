Song:

I'm driving all the way back home,
Cause I don't think you want me here anymore,
Weve been through this a thousand times,
And yet it still comes as a surprise,
When every single answer to your question is a goddamn lie.

Is it worth it?

I'm telling everyone I know,
All the things I did to make you cry so hard,
If I could take it all away, I wouldnt hesitate to bring you back to me,
But like I've always heard, lifes not fair even when you think youre prepared.

Is it worth it?

And I don't know whats happening,
Last I've heard I'm losing everything,
Pretend I am the largest city,
Topple every single building,
Whats done is done and I'm convinced,
There has to be a point behind this,

But I don't have time to figure it out,
I'm waiting for you to take me down.

I'm sinking to the ocean floor,
Cause I'm not waving my arms anymore,
Down here Ill find some friends, maybe even start again,
And Ill be back youll see.
Cause my lifes not through, nor am I with you,
So well call it even till then.

Is it worth it?

And I don't know whats happening,
Last I've heard I'm losing everything,
Pretend I am the largest city,
Topple every single building,
Whats done is done and I'm convinced,
There has to be a point behind this,

But I don't have time to figure it out,
I'm waiting for you to take me down
