Song:

All you need
Is something i'll believe
Flashlights in the hall
But no call
Cause when my day is done
I find where I belong
Waiting on the curb
For you to come to carry on
It won't be long
We'll turn around
I care enough to wake you up
To make us mine i'll make you shine

Stay the night
Stay all your life
Just come with me

Come with me
Won't you come with me
Come with me again
Come with me
(stay the night)
Won't you come with me
(stay all your life)
Come with me again
(just come with me)

Fell so hard I broke my jaw
I couldn't talk to you
Went underground to play around it's true
But I came back
To get you at that place so I could breathe

It's 3 A. M.
And I'm up again
Answering the call of all
The flowers by the bed
Make me wish my head
Was lying and possessed by truth alone a certain home
A wooden gate, a rabbit hole
We'll turn around it won't be long
Capture that place, won't it be fun

Come with me
(stay the night)
Won't you come with me
(stay all your life)
Come with me again
(just come with me)
Come with me
(stay the night)
Won't you come with me
(stay all your life)
Come with me again
(just come with me)

She means more to me
Than any living thing
Younger than the blush of spring she sings

(stay the night)
Won't you come with me
(stay all your life)
Come with me again
(just come with me)
