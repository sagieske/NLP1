Song:

I knew a man who lived in fear.
It was huge, it was angry it was drawing near.
Behind his house, a secret place
Was the shadow of the demon he could never face.
He built a wall of steel and flame
And men with guns to keep it tame.
Then standing back he made it plain
That the nightmare would never ever rise again.
But the fear the fire and the guns remained.

It doesn't matter now. It's over anyhow.
He tells the world that it's sleeping.
But as the night came round I heard it slowly sound.
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.

And then one day the neighbors came.
They were curious to know about the smoke and flame.
They stood around outside the wall,
But of course there was nothing to be heard at all.
"My friends," he said, "we've reached our goal,
The threat is under firm control.
As long as peace and order reign,
I'll be damned if I can see a reason to explain,
Why the fear and the fire and the guns remained. "

It doesn't matter now. It's over anyhow.
He tells the world that it's sleeping.
But as the night came round I heard it slowly sound.
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping.

Is there a light, can you feel the light shine?
I think I've find a way through...
I know things have changed but the fear remained in me
Till I touched the light in you.

Say it's over now, it doesn't matter now.
He tells the world that it's sleeping.
But as the night came round I heard it slowly sound.
It wasn't roaring, it was weeping
