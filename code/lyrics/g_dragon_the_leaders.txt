It don't really get better than this
Don't act like you ain't surprised

Call us the leaders of the new school haha

What's up, what's up, what's up what's up what's up 
What's up, what's up, what's up what's up what's up

Tellebijeone naega naomyeon (what's up)

Meori kkeutbuteo bal kkeutkkaji dareun swagger
Ttarahagien beokcha I seutaireun naekkeo

Ssaujideul malgo cheoncheonhi ije come come and
Naega iraeseo pigonhae jallangeon aragajigo

Too fast to live too young to die
Momjibeun jakjiman nae moksorineun gulliver

Okay, be mad at me all you want

And step your game up

We've been running this sh*t from day one
So be thankful for your style

That's all me homie

All night until infinity
