Song:

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

Tell me what can I say
To bring love here today
That has never been said

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

There is so much I feel
And I know that it's real
Cos I'm thinking of love

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

Love for all of mankind
Cos there's so little time
While we're stinging on hate

[Chorus:]
Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

This I know, this I know, this I know
This I know, this I know, this I know

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

Children do what they see
They watch you, they watch me
Everything must be right

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

Cos they pick up their ways
Watching every day
They will follow your hat

Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

This I know this I know this I know
This I know this I know this I know

Love is the key for you and me, yeah
Love is the key for you and me
Love is the key for you and me, yeah
Love is the key for you and me

Love is the key to eternity, yeah
Love is the key to eternity
Love is the key to eternity, yeah
Love is the key to eternity

Take the time to check it out
Find out what love's all about
Take the time to check it out
Find out what it's all about

Take the time to check it out
Find out what love's all about
Take the time to check it out
Find out what it's all about

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

We must all learn to trust
Without trust there is lust
Every man has his needs

Citizens of the world
Citizens of the world

We must all learn to share
We must all learn a bear
By doing those good deeds

Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

Let's all spread love today so
Then the children will all know
This big world we live in
Is so full of citizens that I know

(Repeat to fade)
