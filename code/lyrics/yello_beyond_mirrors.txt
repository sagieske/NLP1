Song:

The age of science has failed to explain our universe in rational terms.

Consequently the power of magic has gradually emerged from our conscious minds to fathom the unfathomable.

Our most distinguished scientists reluctantly admit, that mankind is nothing but some billion creatures, sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space.

Magic is the art of influencing the cause of events by the intervention of spiritual forces or some other occult device.

According to Arthur C. Clarke any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Early civilization often mistook the unexplainable world around them to be magic.

Rupert Sheldrake in his book "Seven Experiments That Could Change the World" has stated that scientist's attitude toward their experiments affect the results of their experiments.

There is no such thing as a definite fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic plays an important part in our rational world.

Werner Heisenberg, the leading 20th. Century physicist has stated, that mass is a physical interpretation of energy.

Religious organizations have understood the power of magic; and therefore monopolized the interpretation of the supernatural to control the human mind.

The universe as a whole is beyond explanation.

Only at the end of the 20th century the Roman Catholic Church admitted, that the great visionary Galileo Galilei was, in fact, correct.

The second millennium has come to an end. Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic.
