Song:

Somebody save the queen
She's drowning in a shallow dream
Maybe it's make believe
Maybe the unforeseen
How many lines should it take
Trying to keep you awake
How many licks does it take
Before you get to the red in the steak

Digging holes for rabid animals
You and me were soldiers
We were foaming at the mouth
Oh, sweet Caroline... 

Say something back so I know you're alive
Under attack for the rest of our lives
And so we pay the price

Deep in the underground
They whisper, "All men are made equal"
Does anyone else hear the sound?
Has anyone else seen the sequel?

Digging holes for animals, part two
You and me were soldiers
We were wondering what to do
Oh, sweet Caroline... 

Say something back, so I know you're alive
Under attack, for the rest of our lives
And so we pay the price

Red light, green light
Near death, near sight
Are you sober?
Where are you soldier?
Red light, green light
Near death, near sight
Are you sober?
Where are you soldier?

Deep in the underground
They whisper, "All men are made equal"

Digging holes for rabid animals
You and me were soldiers
We were foaming at the mouth
Oh, sweet Caroline... 

Say something back, so I know you're alive
Under attack for the rest of our lives
You do the math
I'll do my best to survive
How can you laugh, while they eat me alive?
And so we pay the price
For having sliced and diced
We nail our Jesus Christ
To the wall
Through the wall
Whispers through the wall
Walking through the wall
Walking through the wall
