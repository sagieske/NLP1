Where he's... The club is shutting down every Sunday
Shut it down,... Place to get it busy,
Shawty... There's no competition
... You can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
It's really classy...
A n****are with money, that's right niggers always...
We selling for twenty, pretending it's just to make them
Shut up my brother heard them, we got them whose...
We take them to the crib, hanging... Acting later
My life is a movie, don't believe me we can bet it
Watch me put your b-tch before the n****are roll the credits
And shout out to my jeweler, he told me to forget it
I just got eight new chasing day, we getting to the money
Where he's... The club is shutting down every Sunday
Shut it down,... Place to get it busy,
Shawty... There's no competition
... You can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
It's really classy...
Young n****are with money, that's why I be fu-king b-tches
Me... Why you be loving b-tches
Shut up my brother heard ya, we get in to the...
And after we make it so right n****are, player
Come to my jacuzzi baby girl and you can get it
Shut that pu-sy down, make it wet when I'm...
Shout out to my jeweler, he told me to forget it
I just got eight new chasing day, we getting to the money
Where he's... The club is shutting down every Sunday
Shut it down,... Place to get it busy,
Shawty... There's no competition
... You can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
... You can get the feeling
I be throwing money all around come and get it
You don't need no... To show you what I'm with it
Problem is I get it,... There's no thing you get it
Together in the vip and she can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
Where he's... The club is shutting down every Sunday
Shut it down,... Place to get it busy,
Shawty... There's no competition
... You can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
... You can get the feeling
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
I see you, I see you girl, I see you, I see you girl
... Club you can get the feeling.
