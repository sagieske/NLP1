Shawn Mendes "Show You" lyrics
You can’t walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, you tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can’t watch your tv show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I rebuild it from the start
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spell it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spell it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spell it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you
