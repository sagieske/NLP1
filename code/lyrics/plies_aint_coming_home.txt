[Plies talking:]
Ay dog this one here for all mutha fuckin ni***z dats locked up dog
All my ni***z who biddn in prison my n***a a lot of ni***z
Forgot about cha but I aint forgot about cha

[Chorus:]
I got some ni***z in prison dat aint comin home
And dey main hoe done put a block on da phone
An all da ni***z dey was runnin
Wit done left em lone
Mutha fuckas foget bout cha when ya bidin Long

[Verse 1:]
What can a young n***a 19 do wit 40 yrs
Not a muh'fuckin thang but hope for an appeal
Dem crackas givin ni***z mo time den dey done lived
Where I'm from deez crackas hidin ni***z at da crib
I asked my homeboy how da f**k do you do 40
He told me you just do it you don't think about it
Dem crackas don't sell liq in prison you gotta think bout it
But like he told me time aint tha thang hurts tha most
The mu fuckas dat forget bout cha that you thought was close
If he had to do it all again he woudnt even take it 2 da doe
I told he aint got to tell me cuz I already know
He thought he had hiself some soldiers on da front row
Well like told him you aint breakin bread no mo
N deez streets dawg dats all a b***h care 4
Da real ni***z n deez streets are at an all time low
And deez hoes and homeboys aint ridin no moe

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
Nobody care about cha when you aint got s**t to give
But when ya got it they love ya while ya out of here
They waz my ni***z when they waz out n they my ni***z now
Right now they need me the most so I got to help em out
I turn my back on em dat mean I'm da p***y n***a den
And me bein flaw is somthing I don't believe in
There's ni***z everyday dats gettin lost n da system
Tha f****d up part about don't nobody miss em
Own brother can't even tell me where the crackas shipped em
Told me that wit a straight face and kept dippin
I'm looking at dog like man this p***y n***a trippin
Ya own brotha ya can't tell me where tha crackas shipped em
*Love* don't love nobody da streetz f****d up
Dats why I pray everyday dat I don't get jammed up
To b honest witcha I'm scared to find out wats what
Tha ones that let ya down the ones ya loved so much

[Chorus x2]

What happin to ni***z acceptin a couple phone calls
And what happin to ni***z sendin flicks to dey dawg
Ya dawg down bad right now gone break em off
Ya got to answer his calls for yall to even talk
I aint like yo can call him shitt wen ya wanna talk
Som ni***z doin time right now dat aint dey fault
In this world it's a black law n it's a white law
A street n***a dawg we don't die of old age
A street n***a dawg we die 1 or three wayz
We get shot, die in prison, or we die of aids
I kno it's already written how imma leave here one day
But all da ni***z locked up I pray 4 ya every day

[Chorus x2]

Ay dawg itz a lot of good mu fuckin ni***z locked up dawg
It's a lot of ni***z dats locked up dat wen dey wuz out of here
My n***a dey took care of a lot of you mu fuckas man
Made sure a lot of yall waz good dawg it's a lot of ni***z doin tyme
Becuz of some of da mu fuckas out here dawg
N now wen a n***a get locked up man
Yall can't make sure dawg got cantine money
Yall can't make sure yall send dawg flicks man
Yall can't cept dawg fone calls man
Ya put a block on da phone cuz ya fuckin anotha n***a man
Dawg keep it real wit ya self homie

For 2 3 years while you waz out of here dawg
The atleast you can do iz take care of dawg 2 or 3 yrs dawg
