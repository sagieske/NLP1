Song:

I can see the anger

And I surely feel

All the passion, baby gone astray

Why are we divided

So dissatisfied

Does it matter what we do or say

I cant see the wisdom

Never gonna give in

When the love is not so far away

I was hoping for more

Im still hoping for sure

Isnt anybody dreamin

Isnt anybody thinking

Or am I all by myself

Isnt anybody teachin

Why is everybody preachin

Am I all by myself

Dont you feel it lately

That youre the only one

Who can see through bitter lies right here

Like everybody knows it

But no one seems to care

As if theres something in the truth we fear

Arent you hoping for more

Im still hoping for sure

Isnt anybody dreamin

Isnt anybody thinking

And all by myself

Isnt anybody lovin

Isnt anybody huggin

Am I all by myself, tell me, tell me

Am I all by myself

All by myself

Come on everybody teach it with me

Am I all by myself

Dont wanna be all by myself

Come on everybody preach it with me
