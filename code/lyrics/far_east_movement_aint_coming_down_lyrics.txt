Song:

High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down
High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down

I got a crazy feeling like, 
Something's going down
Everybody's jumping
Press monkey to the sound, press monkey
See the... from the window to the wall, to the wall
Dirty bass is in your boom box, banging strong
... let me see your hands up in the air
It's a party right here
Cause ain't nobody booming like it's here
It's a party right here
We keep it dirty, dirty, we don't care
We're going higher, and higher
And we ain't coming down

High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down
High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down

Every night's a movie night, when you ride with me, it's a movie
5 girls in the booth, peeling close like tangerines
I mean reinforcements... cause we on girls on girls on girls on girls
I wanna take you higher
... let me see your hands up in the air
It's a party right here
Cause ain't nobody booming like it's here
It's a party right here
We keep it dirty, dirty, we don't care
We're going higher, and higher
And we ain't coming down

High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down
High in air, over it all, living it up
I ain't coming down, coming down, coming down, down, down
I wanna take you higher
Ain't nobody higher
In this party right here, 
Were' going higher, and higher, and higher, and higher, and higher
And we ain't coming down, we ain't coming down
