Song:

Bad to me
If you ever leave me I'll be sad and blue.
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you.
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd los t my one and only.
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me.
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'.
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me.
But I know you won't leave me cause you told me so,
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know you won't be bad to me.
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
Cause they know that I got my one and only.
They'll be glad you're not bad to me.
- John Lennon & Paul Mccartney
