[Slug]
Hence forth, step within my psychoanalysis
Callouses upon my mind make me strain for my lines
Out I ripped it, squeezed the brain, it made some liquid
Drained it in a cup and then I sipped it
Atmosphere! The mic let me clutch it
Thoughts take flight so fit the Slug in your pipe and take a puff kid
F**k it! I heat it like a tea pot - steam hot
Upon the roof, shoot a marble with the verbal slingshot
Take aim, here I came, I'm the same
Back in '86, I'da tag my name upon your window pane
Stained the mind: a deep shade of residue
Voices within the head make choices multiple
Multiply Spawn, Slug a little buzz
And Atmosphere the scuds, 'cause here come the judge
Blasted; so pass the kid a mic so we can paint this
Image of the gifted-anxious, to flip the language
It's the noun meltdown from the outer-shell
Now smell the burning flesh fresh from the hell-bound
And come on down here, this mind path, I'm half-
Mathematic Atmospheric staff with the rhyme craft
Comin to capture, your after-laughter
While I'm hangin from this rafter, I have to rip this rapture
'cause the cramps in my stomach, dismantle
When I tamper with your amplifier, damn you die...

Why try?
The sky presents an eternally unfolding spectacle:
One moment puffs of cumulous clouds scatter across it
And next a billowing thunderhead
Perhaps 10 miles high looms over the horizon
Probing the structure of the sky...
Why try?

Cause I can read an emcee from front to back
From the cover to the classified - I've pacified
My mind with my rhyme skills - I climb hills
And leap, foolish twitch with a single bound
Sending tingles down your spine, designed to swing a pound
This ax-handle triple-inch-spike protruding
From the tip of my mic distrubuting fuckin headshots
Shots to your head, now you're knee-deep, you need sleep
As you trutch thru the sludge and the slugs and the bird s**t
We swarm with the bees and diseases
And even if your dj was Jesus, you could never f**k with these kids
I've swarmed with the bees and diseases
And even if your dj was Jesus, you could never f**k with these kids

[Spawn]
Yea m*******a! You know who you fuckin with
You know what kind of a** whooping comes with this
Your whole crew could get some of this,
Your wack a** f**k kids is what the subject is
Roughnecks live, for only a second
Then they give
Oblivion's, what you've stepped in
Your reps tooken, should have been lookin
I'm sick of you b***h-a** crews when:
You tried take what's not your but 'cha couldn't
Take mine, your fake rhymes - spit them you shouldn't
What will it be now? Another victory
Yo who will it be now? It's Spawn that emcee
Complete, a true champ - stamp that on my essence
Amped shootin presence, fattenin each fuckin sentence
When it's time, then it's time to go
That's what I know, be rippin mics at every show we flow
But who's got my back though?

[Slug]
Stress, Beyond, ant, the Slug

[Spawn]
So you best be on your way before there's trouble...
