Song:

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight I just wanna make
Make love girl
I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight can we just make
Make love girl
Love (12x)
Tonight can we just make
Love (10x)
Tonight can we just make
Love

Lately (lately)
We been going
Through it baby (baby)
Slammin' doors
And yellin'
Like crazy (crazy)
Cusin' each other
Out everyday (everyday)
Every night (every night)
Girl I (girl I)
Just wanna put it
All aside (aside)
And focus
On your body
Tonight (tonight)
Kiss you
On your lips while I
Stroke your hair
Gently let's try
To flip
The script tonight

Cause I just wanna chill
Girl
I wanna feel your body
Next to mine
To mine, to mine
Don't wanna scream, girl
Can we please
Hold each other
Tight, tight

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight I just wanna make
Make love girl
I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight can we just make
Make love girl
Love (12x)
Tonight
Can we just make
Love (10x)
Tonight
Can we just make
Love

Uh, Trina
Now you wanna hold me
Kiss, and touch me
Just yesterday
You ain't even know me
I've been lonely
No communication
Findin' numbers
Am I supposed
To be patient
I waited the sun came up
Watched you walk out
The house I was stuck
Tears fell
Down my face, so hurt
You chase everything
In a tight min-skirt
(Baby, I'm sorry)
That hurt
Was she better than me
Bein in love ain't cost
But you ain't even free
Why me?
Why you standin right here?
Pullin on my wrist
Singin in my ear
You wanna make love
No you wanna play games
I'm a grown woman
Better check my name
Tired of being damaged
All I do is cry
You wanna start over
Gimme 1 reason why

Cause I just wanna chill
Girl I wanna feel your body
Next to mine
To mine, to mine
Don't wanna scream, girl
Can we please
Hold each other
Tight, tight

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight
I just wanna make
Make love girl
I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fuss girl
Tonight
Can we just make
Make love girl
Love (12x)
Tonight
Can we just make
Love (10x)
Tonight
Can we just make
Love

Love, love, love
Love, love

Tonight
Can we just make
Love
(Until end)
