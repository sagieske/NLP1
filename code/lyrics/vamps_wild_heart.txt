Song:

I was walking away,
But she's so beautiful it made me stay
I don't know her name,
But I'm hoping she might feel the same
Here I go again, she got my heart!

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart

Stay here my dear,
Feels like I've been standing right here for years
My mind's made up
Tell me that you feel this, and I won't give up
I won't give up

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart

And I know it's late and I know it's cold
So come right here and I swear I'll never let you go
The way move its wonderful
Let's do it now, cause one day we'll both be old
Oh woah oh

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart

Tonight we'll dance
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
We won't look back,
Take my hand and we will shine
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart
Oh, Oh, Oh
She needs a wild heart [X2]
I've got a wild heart
