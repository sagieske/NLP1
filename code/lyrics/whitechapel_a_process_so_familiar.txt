Song:

It's coursing through my veins
My heartbeat starts to race and I can't breathe
My composure falls apart, my vision blurs and I can't see
I can't stop over thinking, the thought of company is threatening
I can't make sense of anything

I need to be alone, just let me be alone
Please put me anywhere as long as no eye can see
Every second, an hour, cold sweats devour my skin
My body shakes and I am in eternal decay

A process so familiar
A process so divine
This process would be faster
If I could die

I need to be alone, just let me be alone
Please put me anywhere as long as no eye can see
Every second, an hour, cold sweats devour my skin
My body shakes and I am in eternal decay

It never goes away
The chill of the winter air puts me at peace
In the blink of an eye
A pressure release and I return to me
I still keep over thinking
But this overwhelming storm is now at rest
Enter the mind of the obsessed

I need to be alone, just let me be alone
Please put me anywhere as long as no eye can see
Every second, an hour, cold sweats devour my skin
My body shakes and I am in eternal decay

A process so familiar
A process so divine
This process would be faster
If I could die

I just lie and wait
Instead of running away
You can't escape
Process infinity
