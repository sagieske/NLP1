Song:

A million love songs

Put your head against my life, What do you hear
A million words just trying to make, The love song of the year
Close your eyes but don't forget, What you have heard
A man who's trying to say three words,
The words that make me scared

A million love songs later,
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later, And here I am

Looking to the future now, This is what I see
A million chances pass me by, A million chances to hold you
Take me back, take me back, To where I used to be
To hide away from all my truth, Through the light I see

A million love songs later,
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later, And here I am
