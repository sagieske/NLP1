Song:

Honey, Honey...come and dance with me
Honey, Honey...come and dance with me
Oh I say, we look here
On this lovely night
And I feel fine, I feel alright tonight, oh
And I see you there
Oh, in the corner, love faced and all
Sitting by yourself
But I don't wanna see you blue, no
I don't wanna see you in the corner by yourself
Come on now, girl
Lovely, lovely lady
How 'bout you, how 'bout you, how 'bout you come and dance with me
Honey, Honey...come and dance with me
Honey, Honey...come and dance with me
Honey, Honey...come and dance with me
Honey, Honey...come and dance
Boyd
(Scatting)
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance
Girl, How much time, should I take out of the night to warm you up?
How much time, How much time, should I take from the night to warm you up, sweet?
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance with me
Hani, Hani...come and dance
The lovely ladies
