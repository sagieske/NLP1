Song:

Tell me why this world is a mess
I thought you always tried your best
Tell me what am I to do, maybe you should do it too
Tell me why they're sleeping alone
No house, nowhere to call a home
Tell me what I meant to see
Won't you stop preaching at me

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live, wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Or that this song is sung
This song is sung

All the money in the world would never set all the wrongs to right
All the fire in the world will never set my heart alive
A dream of the day, when it's all gone away
And the sun is shining bright
A dream of the day when it's all gone away
The dreams are finite.

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live, wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Or that this song is sung
This song is sung

Don't tell me that it's over please I'm on my knees
I'm beggin you to stop.
Please I'm on my knees, I'm beggin you to stop.

And I wanna see what it's all about
And I wanna live, wanna give something back

Don't tell me that it's over
It's only just begun
Don't tell me that it's over
Or that this song is sung
This song is sung
