Song:

Give me a open game
Don't let it get too far away
This world is not to blame
You've got to protect your name

When everything, everything, everything goes down
All the dust will settle in this new world now
We can make get along together
We can make get along together

Give me a second chance
Don't let it fade so fast
This life isn't make to last
You've got to run while you can

When everything, everything, everything goes down
All the dust will settle in this new world now
We can make get along together
We can make get along together
Everything, everything
