Song:

Bearing 666, you entice the serpent.
So where lies your devotion?
What's your purpose?
You have no business bearing 666.
Witness unprivileged mortals
Incapable of true Evils.
Demons know your face
And know your faith is trivial.
Endure tribulation! 
Impure within your blasphemy, 
Residing behind a mask of novelty.
The demons sense weakness behind your eyes.
Do you possess blackness in your hearts?
Denouncers of God and the heavens, 
Bearing inverted crosses and the number of satan.
How deep do your symbolic convictions run?
Are you willing to sacrifice to revel in sin?
To sustain this image, blood must stain your skin.
Through dark ritual you must kill.
Prove your worth in embrace of the Anti-Christ, 
One with his minions, they beckon you to kill! 
Bearing 666, you must kill! 
Surely none shall stand in acceptance, 
Just as soon none shall bow.
Bearing 666, Imposers! 
You are revoked of your blasphemous mask!
