Song:

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

(Hey)
Run it through a red light
Twice the speed of sound
Drive it on the white line
And pull it in and out

Grab the wheel and take a chance at luck
We got the rythem, gonna tear it up
And burn it after midnight

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh it's getting dangerous, it's contagious
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Wow we're outragious, it's contagious
(Hey)

Say
(Hey)
Walkin' on the high wire
Over a net of flames
I'm headin' for the wild life
We're free to break the chains

Well, don't hesitate when the feelings right
Forget about it, shake and roll the dice
And burn it after midnight

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh it's getting dangerous, it's contagious
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Wow we're outragious, it's contagious, hey

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You know what time it is?
It's time to get wild
(Hey, hey, hey)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ooh it's getting dangerous, it's contagious
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You and me we're outragious, it's contagious

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Come on it's getting dangerous, it's contagious
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You and me we're outragious, it's contagious

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Come on
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey)
You and me, you and me, wow
