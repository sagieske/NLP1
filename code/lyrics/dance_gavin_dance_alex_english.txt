Song:

Stop! The first one to hit the cop wins
His death was so obvious
Make up the things that you did
I hid in bushes, I was tripping on thizz
Description, of no sir you can't ignore
The lights they are blinding, and you man are such a bore
Please smash the target[x3]
Right where the heart sits
Whoever said we had to stop this from happening?
My plans changed abruptly and you chose to flee this unstable setting.
And I'll only survive in this life...
I got that necklace, I got that watch
I copped that blow torch, off your front porch
I'll only survive if it's you by my side...
And I'll only survive in this life...
I got that bottle of jack, I got five on that sack
If this fails then I'll bail you out of jail
It's so obvious you're constantly blocking me from rational thinking

Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed I pluck your feathers
We should f*****g be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go

Well don't it feel good? You got what you paid for[x2]
Maybe I look good in leather
In my bed I pluck your feathers
We should f*****g be together
Now look alive and say you've gotta go

Brace me honey I need friction, if I slur my words correct my diction,
It's not always fact or fiction, I made the plan I'll make my own plan.
Period colon grammar arsenal, I think we need some brand new barstools,
A new decor, oh man that cars cool, I change the plan, I bought my own plan
The night was innocent
But she'll never believe
That I was alone
The night was innocent!
Reciting words I never meant to write
You want a piece of my mind that's fine[x3]
You want a piece of my mind, that's fine

Just keep your arms around me,
And I won't let your body touch...
I won't let it touch the ground
Just keep your eyes on me,
And let me be your gravity
Until you can, can sleep sound[x5]
Until you can...

(You're right I am addicted
The point- I guess I missed it
It's not your fault, but I'll blame it on anything, but myself)
