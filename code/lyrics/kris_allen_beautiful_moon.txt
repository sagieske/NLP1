Song:

Oh beautiful moon
Sing me your song
Make it slow
And sweet
If you can
Oh beautiful moon
Don't worry 'bout the clouds in the sky
'Cause they'll all
Wash away
With the time
Oh

This back porch singin' praises
And when the smoke leaves
I see your faces

Oh beautiful moon
When it's dark out tonight
I thank God
For givin' you your life
Oh beautiful moon
When you're all alone
There's no stars
Where they all go
Oh

The city lights they hide your graces
And when the smoke leaves
I'll see your faces
Oh

Oh
This back porch singin' praises
And when the smoke leaves
I'll see your faces

Oh beautiful moon
Sing me your song
Make it slow
And sweet
If you can
