Song:

It's killing me to say, I'm watching your heartbreak.

I'm watching your heartbreak. x3

Chorus
Mojo Willis (Q.G.)

Its so strange that it ain't the same baby,
And I admit that it's killing me,
It's killing me to say..
I'm watching your heartbreak x3
How much more can I take.
(It ain't the same baby we done changed)
Damn it ain't the same
(I'm trying girl but can't you see its changed)
To see us splitting ways
(To see us going our separate ways)
I can't be the reason that your heartbreak
(Baby girl its killing me)
That your heartbreak.

Q.G Verse.

I used to be the reason that you smile babe
(I used too)
Now we just argue and stay mad babe
(All day)
Damn what happened to the better days?
(What happened babe)
Now we just hoping on a better day
(Just wishing)
I used to be the reason that you talk a lot.
(Talk a lot)
But things change and it seems there's nothing to talk about.
(Nothing)
Hoping and dreaming that things will never change
(I'm praying babe)
Wake up to realize that it was just a dream.
Ain't you scared baby of losing your only love.
Or do you really think that this is what's best for both of us.
(Do you?)
Hoping and praying that things will never change,
(I'm praying man)
Wake up to nightmares once again.

Chorus
Mojo Willis (Q.G.)

Its so strange that it ain't the same baby,
And I admit that it's killing me,
It's killing me to say..
I'm watching your heartbreak x3
How much more can I take.
(It ain't the same baby we done changed)
Damn it ain't the same
(I'm trying girl but can't you see its changed)
To see us splitting ways
(To see us going our separate ways)
I can't be the reason that your heartbreak
(Baby girl its killing me)
That your heartbreak.

Pries Verse

See a lot of things been changing babe,
(Changing babe)
I swear my mind going insane
(Insane)
Cause I'm smoking and drinking
(Drinking)
Cause I know we ain't gone be the same.
What you do when you feeling low?
And she leaving you all alone?
If I push would you push back?
And I got a lot of things to ask,
And I'm serious all caps!
Got me spending all my bar tab,
Where have you been at?
I been calling for four days acting like I need that.
And I need that, that feedback!
That give it to me where we was at
Like a fein for that drug take me back to where we was!

Chorus

Its so strange that it ain't the same baby,
And I admit that it's killing me,
It's killing me to say..
I'm watching your heartbreak x3
How much more can I take.
(It ain't the same baby we done changed)
Damn it ain't the same
(I'm trying girl but can't you see its changed)
To see us splitting ways
(To see us going our separate ways)
I can't be the reason that your heartbreak
(Baby girl its killing me)
That your heartbreak.
