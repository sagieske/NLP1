Song:

Look into my eyes
And see the emptiness within
I'm looking at you like a prize
The kind I'd like to win.

Refrain 1
And though you've never asked me
Just what you mean to me
I have known you for so long
My feelings can't be wrong.

Chorus
More, more than a friend
That's what you will always be to me
I will no longer pretend
There's another side of me for you to see.

While everyone's asleep
I lie awake tonight
I wish I had your photograph
Somewhere within my sight.

Refrain 2
I want you to be near me
Be the apple of my eye
Remove this doubt that burdens me
Say there's no other guy.

Repeat Chorus

Ad lib

Repeat Refrain 1
Repeat Chorus 2x

There's another side of me for you to see
There's another side of me for you to see.
