Song:

Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came pouring down
Me and Billy were standing there we had a sliver half of crown
Our arms are full of fishing rods had the tackle on our backs
We just stood there gettin' wet with our backs against the fence

Oh, the water, oh, the water
Oh, the water, I hope it don't rain all day

It stoned me to my soul
It stoned me just like jelly roll
Well it stoned me, it stoned me to my soul
It stoned me just like going home, going home

Rain let up and the sun came up we were getting dry
Almost let a pick-up truck nearly pass us by
Well we jumped right in and the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road we saw the swing and we jumped right in
Not to mention the fishing poles

Oh, the water, oh, the water
Oh, the water let it run all over me

It stoned me to my soul
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me
It stoned me to my soul
It stoned me just like going home and a jelly roll

On the way back home we sang a song our throats were getting dry
We saw a man from across the road he had the sunset in his eyes
He lived all alone in his own little home he had a great big gallon jar
There were bottles two, one for me and you
And he said, "Hey there you are"

Oh, the water, oh, the water
Oh, the water I get it myself from the mountain stream

It stones me to my soul
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me
It stoned me to my soul
It stoned me just like jelly roll

It stoned me just like jelly roll
I'm comin' home it stoned me just like going home
