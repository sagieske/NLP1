Song:

You were just another pretty face in the crowd
I was just hangin' out
I wasn't ready for love when I looked in your eyes
You took me by surprise
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna stay for the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
& leave me with stars in my eyes

Chorus:
Oh angel in disguise
You're just an angel in disguise

(instrumental)

Almost made it too easy for me to believe
That love could happen to me
But you're not afraid to show me how much you care
& prove your heart is there
You weren't supposed to say that you loved me
You were just gonna spend the night
I never held a hand that could touch me
& leave me with stars in my eyes

[Chorus: X2]
