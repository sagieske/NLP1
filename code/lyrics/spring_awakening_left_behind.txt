Song:

You fold his hands, and smooth his tie., You gently lift his chin- Were you really so blind, and unkind to him? Can't help but itch, to touch, to kiss, To hold him once again. Now, to close his eyes, never open them...? A shadow passed, A shadow passed, Yearning, yearning for the fool it called a home. All things he never did are left behind; All the things his Mama wished he'd bare in mind; And all his Dad had hoped he'd know. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohthe talks you never had, the Saturdays you never spent, All the "grown-up" places you never went; And all of the crying you wouldn't understand, you just let him cry-"Make a man out of him". A shadow passed, a shadow passed, Yearning, yearning for the fool it called a home. All the things he ever wished are left behind; All the things his Mama did to make him mind; And how his Dad had hoped he'd grow. All things he ever lived are left behind; All the fears that ever flickered through his mind; All the sadness that he'd come to own. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (2x)Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oha shadow past, a shadow past, Yearning, yearning for the fool it called a home. And, whistles through the ghosts still left behind... It whistles through the ghosts still left behind... It whistles through the ghosts still left behind... Oh, Oh
