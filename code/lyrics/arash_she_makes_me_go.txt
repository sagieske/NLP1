Song:

She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh

Ra ba ba dam dam dam diggy diggy
Arash! 
Sean paul! 
She makes me go! 
She makes me go! 

Bring that body, come give me girl
I got to think I can rock your world, 
Bring that body, come give me girl
A long time I'ma lock you girl! 
Drop it girl, then pop it girl
Don't push my button, suck it girl
Give me the sexy one, make me go cocky girl.

(X2:)
She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh

Show me? make me feel high, 
Then go boom like daddy yankee
Touch upon the sky
Tell so right, make me feel high
? come on girl turn me on! 
Ra ba ba dam dam dam diggy diggy

She makes me go! 
She makes me go! 

I know just how to keep it
On and on, bounce it gilr
Til I'm on, move that body
You got to groove that body
Lemme see that you can perform.
Tell me to you I'm the champion, 
Darling, to you I'm the number one.
Spinnin it, then turn it
Seems that you've earned it
Knowin' you where to begun.

Bring that body, come give me girl
I got to think I can rock your world, 
Bring that body, come give me girl
A long time I'ma lock you girl! 
Drop it girl, then pop it girl
Don't push my button, suck it girl
Give me the sexy one, make me go cocky girl.

(X2:)
She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh
She makes me go oh oh oh oh oh oh
