Song:

[Verse 1]
Everybody think that I am nuts
By all means I am
'Cause I am crazy and out of my head
Everybody think that I'll flip out
By all means I will
'Cause I am unstable and I need help
[Pre-chorus]
Everybody knows (Won't get the best of me)
I will ignore
Those words they speak will not get the best of me
[Chorus]
Haven't we shed enough blood?
I know there's got to be something better
Haven't we lost what was ours?
What was ours (Ours, ours, ours)
[Verse 2]
Everybody thinks that I gave up
By all means I did
'Cause I am stupid and on the edge
Everybody thinks that I am wrong
By all means I am
'Cause I am unhealthy but I move on
[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]
[2x]
Because we've got to figure this out
(We've got to figure this out)
