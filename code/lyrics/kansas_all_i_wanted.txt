Song:

You say it's time to stay behind
All I wanted was to hold you
All I wanted was to touch you

No need for blame cause we're not the same
All I wanted was to love you
That's all I wanted

How many times will it take
Hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break
You're hurting me the way I'm loving you the way I do

It's not so strange for us to change
All I wanted was to love you that's all I wanted

How many times will it take
Hurting me the way you do
How many times till I break
You're hurting me the way

I'm loving you the way I do
