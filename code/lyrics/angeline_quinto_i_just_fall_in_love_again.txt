Song:

Dreaming, I must be dreaming
Or am I really lying here with you
Baby, you take me in your arms
And though I'm wide awake
I know my dream is coming true

And oh, I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
It happens every time
There I go by just fall in love again
And when I do I can't help myself
I fall in love with you

Magic it must be magic
The way I hold you when
The night just seems to fly
Easy for you to take me to a star
Heaven is that moment
When I look into your eyes

And oh, I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
It happens every time
There I go by just fall in love again
And when I do I can't help myself
I fall in love with you, ooh

Oh, I just fall in love again
Just one touch and then
It happens every time
There I go by just fall in love again
And when I do I can't help myself
I fall in love with you

I can't help myself
I fall in love with you
