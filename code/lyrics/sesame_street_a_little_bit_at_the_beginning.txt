Song:

A little bit at the beginning
A little more later on
Watching all the good things grow
That's how the world goes on
Take a look at the river
Pouring into the bay
And you see all the good things growing better every day

Well, take a look at a baby
Sleeping on his mamas arm
Plan to love him when hes small
Will grow him safe and strong
Take a look at the sunshine
Pouring out on the day
And you see all the good things growing better every day
