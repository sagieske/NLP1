Song:

Shake shake shake on the floor
Take take take take me lower
Loud loud loud beating rhythm
Hush Hush Hush keep it secret

Reckless without reason
Defenseless dive on the floor
Baby ready set fly away

I'm in a trance with you Forget
Embrace our instinct
I want to see your other face
Kissing your lips
Calling for your devil side

Come come come on you're thirsty
Shame Shame Shame don't be so shy
(Right or wrong who decided?)
Talk talk talk monsters talking

Reckless without reason
Defenseless dive on the floor
Baby ready set fly away

I'm in a trance with you Forget
Embrace our instinct
I want to see your other face
Kissing your lips
Calling for your devil side

Baby fly away from this world

I'm in a trance with you Forget
Embrace our instinct
I want to see your other face
Kissing your lips
Calling for your devil side

I'm in a trance with you Forget
Embrace our instinct
I want to see your other face
Kissing your lips
Calling for your devil side
