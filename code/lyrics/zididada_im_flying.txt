Album: Welcome to Zididada

I once heard a story told to me
About the great wonders of the deep blue sea
The sun was shining making a silvershield
The moon and the stars reflecting in a waterfield

Uuu I'm flying
Across the sky
Uuu I'm flying
So high

You tell me you want me to quit
But I'm a beliver
The dreams I dream you know I have to sustain
I want to fly so high the wind will take me
But the world outside will never set me free
