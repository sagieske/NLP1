Song:

I know you want your money, girl
Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
Nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch

I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside
I'm not a fool
I'm just lifeless too

But you to taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
What nobody ever could

I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment till my time is done
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In such long, I've succumbed to what I've become, baby

I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside
I'm not a fool
I'm just lifeless too

I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
Because you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But, you belong to the world (x3)

You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
