Song:

Those cars
On you
So small
Down there
From here
So high
We drift
We fly
Twilight breaks through
A different kind of blue
More lights
Blue signs
All gold
All new
So small
So high
Down there
Tonight
With twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue
Twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue
