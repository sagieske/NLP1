Song:

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name

Listen to me baby
What I say is true
They could drop me in the ocean
I'd swim to the bank
And get back home to you

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name

They may kill me darlin'
Honey just like they do
Well, my body might die
But my spirit's gonna rise
And crawl back home to you

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name
Don't even know my name

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
But you don't even know my name
Said you don't even know my name
Said you don't even know my name
No, you don't even know my name
No, you don't even know my name
No, you don't even know my name
