Song:

[Verse:]
Ashes of the innocent!, The end for you and me,
Darkened screams of agony, Are begging set me free,
Mourning all your loved ones, As their bodies turn to stone,
Violence, Hate and Agony... Are what we've grown to know.

[Chorus:]
Hold me, Show me, Bring me to my knees,
So as the fire burns and the tables turn,
We'll never rest in peace...
Rest in peace!

[Verse 2:]
Ashes of the innocent!, Remind me of the past,
Taking scars of victory, The time has passed too fast,
Singing broken melodies, Like shards of broken glass,
Ripping through my reverie, These scars will never last.

[Chorus:] [x2]
Hold me, Show me, Bring me to my knees,
So as the fire burns and the tables turn,
We'll never rest in peace...
Rest in peace!

[Solo]

Ashes of the innocent!, The end for you and me,
Darkened screams of agony, Are begging set me free.

[Chorus:] [x2]
Hold me, Show me, Bring me to my knees,
So as the fire burns and the tables turn,
We'll never rest in peace...
Rest in peace!
