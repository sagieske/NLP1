Song:

Here I go again love's standing at my door
I'm so afraid to take a chance for I've been hurt before
It's not that I can't love you your life I'd like to share
But my heart's been broken so many times it's just afraid to care
Maybe time will ease the pain and someday I can love again
My heart can't stand a new affair
It's loved and lost so many times it's just afraid to care
[ steel ]
Maybe time will ease the pain...
