Song:

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till you're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of the hand
For me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you where I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are

When my head's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
Mmm, I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul will never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll continue making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are

So baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Ohh darling
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And baby we found love right where we are (x2)
