Song:

For a long time we've,
Been marching off to battle.

In our thundering herd,
We feel a lot like cattle.

Like the pounding beat
Our aching feet aren't easy to ignore

Hey! Think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for

Huh?

That's what I said,
A girl worth fighting for...
I want her paler than the moon,
With eyes that shine like stars

My girl will marvel at my strength,
Adore my battle scars.

I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like.
It all depends on what she cooks like.
Beef, pork, chicken.
Mmm

Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer.

And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor.

You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war!
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.

My girl will think I have no faults.

That I'm a major find.

Uhh, How 'bout a girl who's got a brain,
Who always speaks her mind?

Nah!

My manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her!

He thinks he's such a lady killer.

I've a girl back home,
Who's unlike any other.

Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother.

But when we come home in victory,
They'll line up at the door
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for.
Wish that I had...
A girl worth fighting for.
A girl worth fighting-
