Song:

(Three two one)
Been waiting so long, so long so long, to get you alone
I’m writing this song, this song, this song.
So you come along (baby won’t ya come along)
An now that your here I hope you here
What I'm tryna’ say, yeah
Cause’ I'm letting go, on everything
Just so you can stay, yeah, yeah

All I really need is you with me, oh, oh
An I really can't do this
All by myself

I’m giving my everything
There ain't no point without ya’
With the sweetest thing
Yeah there's just no doubt about ya’, oh
You are the sweetest thing,
Girl your the sweetest thing, oh, oh

Now that you’ll know just when I said
“Wont you take my hand”
Cause I'm making sure your part of my, everyday

All I really need is you with me, oh, oh
An I really can't do this
All by myself

I’m giving my everything
There ain’t no point without ya’
With the sweetest thing
Yeah there's just no doubt about ya’, oh
You are the sweetest thing,
Girl your the sweetest thing, oh, oh

Say you’ll be mine
Forever in time
Girl be mine.

I’m giving my everything
There ain’t no point without ya’
With the sweetest thing
Yeah there's just no doubt about ya’, oh
You are the sweetest thing,
Girl your the sweetest thing, oh, oh

I’m giving my everything
There ain’t no point without ya’
With the sweetest thing
Yeah there's just no doubt about ya’, oh
You are the sweetest thing,
Girl your the sweetest thing, oh, oh
