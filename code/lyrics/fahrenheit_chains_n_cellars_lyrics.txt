Song:

Following the dark side of desire
Saw you in the myst with your heart on fire
With my loaded gun, ready for action
Eye to eye contact, instant attraction

C'mon baby, let's get started
Little time to get to know each other
The night is young and my body is hungry
Show me what you've got to make this man feel manly

Come with me, don't be afraid, come on!
Down to my room of pleasure
You'll feel like never before
Under my spell of Chains n' cellars

Felt it before, premonition of danger
Evil disguised with the face of an angel
110%, pure satisfaction
What happened that night was a chain reaction

C'mon baby, let's get started
Little time to get to know each other
The night is young and my body is hungry
Show me what you've got to make this man feel manly

Come with me, don't be afraid, come on!
Down to my room of pleasure
You'll feel like never before
Under my spell of Chains n' cellars
