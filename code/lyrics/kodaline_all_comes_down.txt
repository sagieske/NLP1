Song:

I still hear the sound of that runaway train
Both in my heart is like love as refrain
But I know in my heart I can never go back
To the way that we were on that runaway track

I see in my soul and I know you’re a lie
You told me I lose control
Oh I didn’t know
So just leave me alone

But why do I feel so old?
‘Cause I know I’m still so young

Yea, but it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you

You see it
But then you do it
And you’re so alone tonight
This heartbreak
Only choosing God’s word to save me
Love is a battle oh oh oh
Everybody cries

It all comes down to
When it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yea, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you

And if you’re wondering why
The position in my soul
And I feel so alone
Like I’m losing control
But you’re still young, oh yea

Why do I feel so old?
‘Cause I know I’m still so young

When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
It all comes down to
Yea, it all comes down to
It all comes down to
It all comes down to you
(All comes down to you)

When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(All comes down to you)
When it all comes down to
When it all comes down to
(All comes down to you)
All comes down to you
All comes down to you
All comes down to you
