Song:

Live the city lets run into the wild
Never lonely but no one inside
Hear the whisper that country calls my name
See the springfiled that never be the same
I'm in heaven there's nothing more to say
You may laugh now but I want to stay
I need rest and I need a sense of peace
Once complete when the mind is at ease
*/Singing home near the mountains
Home by the sea
Singing home where the heart is
Be with me where ever I go
Be with me, come be with me now/
Easy living, one days along and it smell
When to last now I wish I knew how
Lost in wonder I trembled at the thought
Near the water smile as me so
Repeat *
Instrumental
Repeat* till fade
