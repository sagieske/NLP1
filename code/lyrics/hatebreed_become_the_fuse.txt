Song:

I Won't own the consequence of your deception
Or live within the confines of your blame
I can't see the destruction of peace
From the places I know are guarded by belief
We may never undo what is ruinous
But we will weather what storms may strike
From this day on, may the torch inside always stay

Ignited with burning conviction

Become the fuse
Behold the fire of redemption
Become the fuse
Let this be the catalyst of action

You know what it takes to be ignited?
So much more to say so much more to be done
Silence can never be divided
And love will never be enough

Believe only some of what you see
Awaken the light you know that exists within
You know what is holding you captive
Is in conflict with your perception

Become the fuse
Become the fire within
Become the fuse
The strength to be the catalyst of action

Awaken, the dormant force
Awaken, the light within
Awaken, it must be done
Awaken, become the fuse

You know what it takes to be ignited?
So much more to say so much more to be done
Silence can never be divided
And love will never be enough

We may never undo what is ruinous
But we will weather what storms may strike
From this day on, may the torch inside be always stay

Ignited with burning conviction
Become the fuse
Behold the power of redemption
Become the fuse
Let this be the catalyst of action
Become the fuse
Summon fire of devotion
Become the fuse
Let this be a life tranformation
