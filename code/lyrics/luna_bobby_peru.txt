Song:

I told lies to your family concerning your whereabouts
They feel so sorry for me
I invented jealous stories, my imagination ran wild
I made myself so angry

The night that you insulted me I lay awake thinkin'
Clever things I could have said
My thoughts kept turning to Bobby Peru
How would he handle this one?

's' is for sorry for all that I did
Now is the time to turn it all around
I know what's the matter, so why can't I fix it?
Forgive me please

I had lunch with an old girlfriend who knows all my faults
And pretends to want to help
She said I really don't mind your keeping secrets from me
But please don't keep them from yourself

Murder is bad, and suicide is sad
Why would a girl like that put her head in the oven?
You have your theories and I have one too
It's such a waste

's' is for sorry for all that I did
Now is the time to turn it all around
I know what's matter, so why can't I fix it?

This feeling is eternal, for as long as it lasts
Now is the time to turn it all around
I know what's matter, I'm trying to fix it?
Forgive me please

's' is for sorry for all that I did
Now is the time to turn it all around
I really don't mind you keeping secrets from me
But please don't keep them from yourself
