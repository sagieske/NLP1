Song:

I see you comin down
Your life is flashin before ya
I see you comin round
You're talking over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
I see you comin down
Too bad there's nothing left over
I don't know what you mean
You're talkin over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
I see you wakin up
And now the day is upon ya
The party's over now
You're talkin over and over
You know I tried to please ya
You're under anesthesia
