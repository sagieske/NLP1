Song:

Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
And they may not want it to end
But it will it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
But that wont happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust

I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
I can't offer you proof
But you're going to face a moment of truth
Its hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
So break my heart of you must
Its a matter of trust

You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for gods sake don't shut me out

This time youve got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it
Whatever you choose
I wont hold back anything
And I'll walk a way a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
Its make believe until it's only a matter of time
And some might have learned to adjust
But then it never was a matter of trust

I'm sure you're aware love
Weve both had our share of
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong

Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
After youve heard lie upon lie
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But that can't happen to us
Because it's always been a matter of trust
