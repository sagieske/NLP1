Song:

This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all a lone
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and the
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear, oh when
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near
