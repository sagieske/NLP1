Song:

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one﻿ more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home and I'll say
"I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin
And we started at the end

Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lu-lu-lungs
Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

Yeah
Yeah

You cut me off, I lost my track
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful?
Do you wanna, uh
Yeah

I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck now, I'm up next
Tonight, I'm high as a private jet

Cause I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one﻿ more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home and I'll say
"I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin
And we started at the end

Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lu-lu-lungs
Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young

My heart is like a stallion
They love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful?
Do you wanna, huh
Yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck now, I'm up next
Tonight, I'm high as a private Jet, yeah

Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
Scream it from the top of your lu-lu-lungs
Say it, (yeah)
Let's be alone together, (yeah)
We could stay young forever, (yeah)
We'll stay young, young young

I- I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one﻿ more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home and I'll say
"I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin
And we started at the end.
