Song:

Been walking all day
Been crying all night
Doesn't seem to be an answer in sight
A frightened heart cries out to you
Waiting for your love to break through
I've tried my best to do what is right
I only want your love in my life
So I call out to you and I try to get near
But silence is all that I hear
Help me
Help me
To wait
Help me
