Song:

Well I've tried to live like 
The way that you wanted me to
Never needed the proof
Just followed the rules
I pick up the paces 
And I move my feet as fast as I can
I'm always falling behind, just float in the lines
You want more and ambition's taken its toll on you
Well hey your confidence is fading with your youth

[Hook]
And you say that dreamers always get what they desire
Well I've found the more I want the less I've got

[Chorus]
Is this the life 
You've been waiting for?
Or are you hoping that you'll be where you want with a little more?

You're coughing blood again
I know 'cause I clean up the mess every now and then
Fold the line among the seam
Force a smile and never say what you mean
You're in the promised land in someone else's dream
If you want more, 
And you'll get there
Throw a quarter in the well
It's ok, you're fine, ambition's not a crime

[Hook]

[Chorus]

Well ask yourself!

Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well ask yourself
Is this the life you've been waiting for?
Well ask yourself!

[Chorus]

Well ask yourself!

[Chorus]

Well ask yourself!
