Song:

Sitting here all alone inside this room tonight,
Cannot be awake, no, the day yeah
Rummaging through the dark and empty closet of my mind
But I got all the time in space
To tell you all that's on my mind
I still haven't found the way

But the thoughts inside my head
Are begging you to say
So come on back to me, come on back to me
Out of everything you've said, I still have the urge to say
Come on back to me, come on back to me, yeah, yeah

Sitting here all alone inside this room tonight,
Cannot be awake, no, the day yeah
Rummaging through the dark and empty closet of my mind
But I got all the time in space
To tell you all that's on my mind
I still haven't found the way

But the thoughts inside my head
Are begging you to say
Come on back to me, come on back to me
Out of everything you've said, I still have the urge to say
Come on back to me, come on back to me, yeah

Just say the word and I'll be running fast as I can to you
No there's nothing I won't do for you right now
And afterwards after making it through all the stormy weather
We can put the pieces back together

So come on back to me, come on back to me
Out of everything you've said, I still have the urge to say
Come on back to me, come on back to me, yeah
Come on back to me, Come on back to me,
Come on back to me, yeah
