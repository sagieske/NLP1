Song:

Marked to be alone,
And my eyes are closed.
Drawn and separate.
For sakes of discernment.
Walk with the broken pieces.
They do not say a word.
They speak not a word to the broken sea.
Not burnt by the fire.
Or pulled by the flood.
They come to rest in crimson pools of blood.
Guided by the wind.
Not burnt by the fire.
Not pulled by the flood.
The come to rest (alone, alone) But they,
They go, so we ride. But the candle burns alone.
It guides us safetly home.
