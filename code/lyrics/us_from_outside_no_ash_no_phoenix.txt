Song:

Now as I dream in (Four words) I find a way to express in my life
The idea behind acting not saying, and doing not dying.
This moment here is where these patterns collapse.
(And something born) and somethings born... 

They move in numbers as they go, 
Each one a scar within my heart.
I watch in teams the seasons call, 
Each one is claiming their part.

And so you found me falling away, to be honest I'm not okay. (okay)
All I ever wanted was to show I could make it right. (To see)
Seeing now what it was I waited for, now it's all gone.
And now I'm waiting and torn apart. (Like this now)

Within your heart you wait alone.
(Within your heart I'll be alone and freezing)

From now on you won't even waste your time, 
I'm not waiting for you. I'm done too.
(I fucking hate you! )

I've been wasting too much time
And now I need to find a place to call my own.
I don't mean to bleed you dry, 
I need to breathe and now I know I'll make it on my own.
(While you're alone I dine on the unknown).
I'll rest my head, what defines you best?
(And my god takes it)
I'll reach and pick you up and now it's time to go.
(I'm making up my mind)
I'll reach and pick you up and now it's time to go
(How could such criminal eyes become the witness?
That which caused my demise)

They move in numbers as they go, 
Each one a scar within my heart.
I watch in teams the seasons call, 
Each one is claiming their part.
