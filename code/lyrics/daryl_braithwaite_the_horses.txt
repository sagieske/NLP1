Song:

We will fly-y-y way up high-igh-igh where the cold wind blows
Or in the sun, laughin' havin' fu-un with all the people that she knows
And if the situation should keep us separate-ed, you know the world won't fall apart
And you will free the beautiful bir-ir-ird that's caught inside your heart

Can't you hear her, oh she cries so loud, casts her wild note over water and cloud
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin', we'll be riding on the horses yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darli-in', and if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up...

You will grow-ow and until you go-o, I'll be right there by your si-ide
And even then whisper the wi-ind and she will carry up your ride
I hear all the people of the wor-orld (people of the wor-orld) in one bird's lonely cry
See them tryin' every way they know how-ow-ow to make their spirit fly

Can't you see him, he's down on the grou-ound
He has a broken wing, looking all arou-ou-ound
That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky-y little darlin')
Oh, and if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin' (be little darlin')
You'll go riding on the horses yeah yeah
Way up in the sky little darlin' (in the sky-y little darlin')
And if you fall I'll pick you up, pick you u-up

That's the way it's gonna be little darlin'
You'll go riding on the horses yeah yeah
(Pick you up darlin' if you fall) Way up in the sky little darlin'
(Don't you worry 'bout a thi-ing little girl)
And if you fall I'll pick you up, I'll pick you up
