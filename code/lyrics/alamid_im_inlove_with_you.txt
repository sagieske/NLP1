Song:

I never dreamed that I met you in summer.
And there would be warm love to remember.
And you give yourself away to me.
And I'm happy when you're beside me.

Chorus Repeat 2 x)

I don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
All I know is that I'm inlove with you.

I never dreamed that we'll be together
And our love will be forever..
There's not a day that passes by &i don't wonder why
Just take my hand don't say goodbye..

Repeat chorus:

I don't know what to say
I can't control to love you
All I know is that I'm inlove with you
