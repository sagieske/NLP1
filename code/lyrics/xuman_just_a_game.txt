Song:

I could start with a reason
And answer why
Someone torture their feeling
On the sly
On the sly
I never thought that it could be
A suicide
Precious time that we're wasting
But price too high
Price too high

I know it's just a game
But it only matters when you love
I know it's just a game
But it only matters when you love

Silent games won't hurt you now
Wishful things
By any means
Silent games won't hurt you now
Wishful things
By any means

We're just coping and pasting
Our days of live
Callous nights put on circle
And underlie
Underlie
Playing roles that we have to
Cannot deny
We are begging for mercy
But no reply
No reply
