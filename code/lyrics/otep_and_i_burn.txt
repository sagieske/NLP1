Song:

There is a weight
Within me

(And I burn)

A kiss
Heavier than the sun

(And I burn)

A slow invasion
Strange beauty

(And I burn)

Rejected in the flesh
And odd nourishment
(And I burn)
For my soul

Thickening
Far away atoms

Like fat happy Buddahs
This intimate new language
Softer than the breath
That slips from your lips

(And I burn)

In the veretoss

(And I burn)

The depth of you
(And I burn)
Follows me

And I burn
And I burn
