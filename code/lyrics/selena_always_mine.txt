Song:

All my friends say that I'm a fool
And that I should give up on you
Many times, I've surely tried
But there is something down deep inside
I've spent some time
Trying to think all this through
But I always end up wanting to be with you
Como una flor que necesita el agua
Sin tu amor, se marchita mi alma
You...

You will always be, always mine
Be mine till the end of time
Always mine...
You will always be, always mine
Be mine till the end of time
Always mine...
