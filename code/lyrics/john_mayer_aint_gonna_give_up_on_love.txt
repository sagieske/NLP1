Song:

I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on you and me
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna give up on love

Every beat of my heart baby, pounds with joy but not in vain
Every beat of my heart baby, pounds with joy but not in vain
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna
I ain't gonna give up on love

Little Johnny Taylor told us all, oh so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'.... Woah that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will.... Oh surely be paid
Oh when we gave up on love.... Love will surely have it's day
If we all just give up on love, yeah

I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna, Love ain't gonna, Love ain't gonna,
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up, I ain't gonna give up, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna give up on love

Everytime I try a little good love, good love, good love,
Good love just won't let me be
