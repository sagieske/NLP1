Song:

[Verse:]
There's a line, there's a road that we're walking
Different path to the point where they're crossing
But each step is one step closer to you (oh)
As the sun says goodnight in the distance
A thousand lights fill the sky like they missed us
But each one is lighting my way to you (yeah)

[Chorus:]
But this time, it's taking me over
It's making me feel something that I don't understand but
This heart it couldn't beat faster, tonight a thousand lights
They shine, shine for us

[Verse 2:]
Maybe fate is a reason it finds us
But maybe fate is a story behind us
All I know is I'll go wherever it takes me
But every turn every time that I just might break
When I'm walking the line it makes me love and hate
I can promise you that I'll choose love, 'cause

[Chorus:]

They shine, they shine, shine for us
They shine, they shine, shine for us
They shine, they shine, shine for us
Oh lighting my way
To where you are
All that I've done to get this far
The love that I see just falls apart
But I know what we are

[Chorus:]
