Song:

Now, there's a man in the funny papers we all know
Yeah he, lives way back a long time ago
He don't eat nothin' but bear cat stew
Well, this cat's name is Alley Oop

He's got a genuine chauffeured dinosaur
And he can knuckle your head before you count to four
He's got a big ugly club and a head full of hair
Yeah, like great big lions and grizzly bear

Now, he's the toughest man there is alive
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
He's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that caveman go

Yeah, he rides through the jungle tearin' limbs offa trees
Knocking great big monsters dead on their knees
Yeah, other cats don't bug him cause they know better
Cause he's a mean motor scooter and a bad go-getter

He's the toughest man there is alive
He wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
He's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that caveman go

There he goes
Look at that caveman go
He sure is [Incomprehensible]
Ride, daddy, ride

Heigh-ho, dinosaur
Like what's happening
He's too much
Like [Incomprehensible]
Ride daddy
