Song:

[1] You are the eyes of the reader
I am the hand of the writer
Together we can fill up a page
You are the ears of the listener
I am the voice of the picture
Together we can act out the age. Chorus All the world is a stage all the people are players,
Turn on the spotlight it's yours.
All the world is a stage, all the people are players,
Ring up the curtain Applause one thing's for certain, it's yours![2] You are the sense of occasion
Mine is a standing ovation
Your pleasure is only at your command
You are to set the example
I am the one to portray it
To measure the storm that follows the calm. Chorus are E P E A T[3] You are the eyes of the reader
I am the hand of the writer
Together we can fill up a page
You are the brain of the thinker
I am the fave of expression
Together we can act out the age. Chorus are E P E A T[4] The start and end to every story is the same
But what comes in between you have yourself to blame:
It makes no difference at all
Just pick yourself when you fall
So ring up the certain - applause.
