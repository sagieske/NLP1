Song:

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and how I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary
She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into fell good
Oh, and how I wish was
Lying in the arms of Mary
Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when I'd learned
All she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take
So now when I feel lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary
So now when I feel lonely
Still looking for the one and only
That's when I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary
Mary, Mary
Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when I'd learned
All she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take
The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and how wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lying in the arms
Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms
Lying in the arms
Yeah, yeah, yeah
