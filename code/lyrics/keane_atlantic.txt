Song:

I hope all my days will be lit by your face
I hope all the years will hold tight our promises

I don't want to be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home

I don't want to be old and feel afraid
I don't want to be old and sleep alone
An empty house is not a home

I don't want to be old and feel afraid
And if I need anything at all
I need a place that's hidden in the deep
Where lonely angels sing you to your sleep
Though all the world is broken

I need a place where I can make my bed
A lover's lap where I can lay my head
Cos now the room is spinning

The day's beginning
