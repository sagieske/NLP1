Song:

Smile, the smile you used, you choose this hard life, yeah
Get in, the villain stole your true love
And the room, the room, the room that he gave you his hand
And bottle, the bottle he used was just a little heavier, man
Never again, never again, will you refuse this face
Smoking, smoke in his eyes and your love was like, gold
And riding, you thought of riding home alone
And the loop, the loop, the loop that he gave you was planned
And bottle, the bottle he used was just a little heavier, man
Never again, never again, will you refuse this fuckin face
