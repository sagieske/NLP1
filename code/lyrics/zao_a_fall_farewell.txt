Song:

In a time of quietness I reflect on childhood memories
Caught wisping through my mind
Falling leaves create the stage
Words spoken were not cherished

On the last day of our friendship
And those words were possibly the last
What were your thoughts

As a dreaming child I awaken to a nightmare
After a gentle nudge I find out you're gone

The machines that kept you alive were careless
Did you ask Him to forgive you
Before you passed on

You slipped on away into the ground
You broke the vanity
You brought the silence

(I hope you are with Jesus)
