Song:

What they do
They smile in your face, all the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face, all the time they wanna take your place the back stabbers (back stabbers)

All you fellow's, who have someone, and you really care, yeahhhhhhh, yeah, yeah
Then it's all of you fellows who better beware, yeah, yeah
Somebody's out, to get your lady
A few of your buddies they sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
And I don't think they'll miss

(What they do!)

(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

I keep gettin', all these visits, from my friends, yeah,
(What they doing to me)
They come to my house again and again and again and again, yeah
So are they there to see my woman
I don't even be home but they just keep on comin'
What can I do to get on the right track
I wish they'd take some of these knives off my back

(What they do)

(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

Low down... Dirty...

(What they do!)

(They smile in your face)
Smiling faces... Smiling faces sometimes
(Back stabbers)

(They smile in your face)
I don't need... Low down, dirty b******s
(Back stabbers) [fade]
