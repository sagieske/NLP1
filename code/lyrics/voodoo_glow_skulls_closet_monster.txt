Song:

Hey mom, hey dad! Where's your kid
She's studying in the library like she said
She did, she always wore a pretty smile
Sitting in the classroom without denial
Do you remember telling her what to do
What you told her she would always do
Blushing, hiding from the truth
I know I should have told you about her
But now It's too late what will you do
Your daughter's fat. Disgusting too
She has twelve kids, there's something even better
Every time the drinks get better
You swore that you had her life planned
Go to college understand
Well, miss candy prom queen won't use her hands
I know I should have told you about her
At highschool she was like a saint
Like pre-school children and finger-paints
Blushing, hiding, feeling shame
I know the story ends the same
At the parties she would say
I wish I never felt this way
If I could start my life again
I wouldn't be a closet monster
