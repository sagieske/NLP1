Song:

[Verse:]
I've had my share of good and bad news
I've had to cry when no one else knew
Felt all alone like nobody could really understand
But I heard you whisper a sweet melody
Said give me your burdens, give them to me
Today I stand, Lord, stronger and wiser because of you
[Chorus:]
Because of you
Because of you
Because of your love and grace and mercy
I've made it through
And no I'm not perfect
Sometimes I fall
Yet, Lord, you've been there whenever I call
And if anyone asks me how did I make it
It's because of you
[Verse 2:]
Strong for my family I have to be
But tell me who's strong, who's strong for me

Who gives me strength and courage and wisdom to make it through?
But there's not a friend, no not one
None that can help you, not like the Son
If anyone asks me how did I make it
It's because of you
Oh
[Chorus:]
It's because of you
It's because of you
Because of your love and grace and mercy
I've made it through
No I'm not perfect
And sometimes I fall
But yet, Lord, you've been there whenever I call
If anyone asks me how did I make it
If anyone asks me how did I, how did I go through
If anyone asks me how did I make it
If anyone asks me how did I go through
If anyone asks me, Tamia, how did you do it?
It's because of you
