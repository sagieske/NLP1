Song:

Well if you only knew the pain that I've been through
Since when did it become all about you
As you can see right from the start I've said the truth
And if the truth means nothing to you
Then what am I supposed to do?

And I'll still love you
Beyond what words can say
I'll take your every suffering moment
And bring a better day
I'll still love you
More then what I hope to be
Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me take your breath away

And every time I ask
You assure you're doing fine
But your heart looks good by smiling
You couldn't fool mine
By the end of the night your pilliow sits to dry
In a crowded room you're singing
But on the inside you cry

And I'll still love you
Beyond what words can say
I'll take your every suffering moment
And bring a better day
I'll still love you
More than what I hope to be
Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me take your breath away

In a ball room there is dancing
In a forest there are trees
In a child there's a hope
That keeps him in belief
With any star there is a sky
With any beach there's a sea
With any love song there's a lover
And in your heart I hope it's...

And I'll still love you
Beyond what words can say
I'll take your every suffering moment
And bring a better day
I'll still love you
More then what I hope to be

Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me wrap my arms around you
Let me take your breath away
