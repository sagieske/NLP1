Song:

So many times I was alone and couldn't sleep
You left me drowning in the tears of memory
And ever since you've gone, I found it hard to breathe
'Cause there was so much that your heart just couldn't see

A thousand wasted dreams rolling off my eyes
But time's been healing me and I say good-bye...

'Cause I can breathe again, dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like we used to be the other day
Now I feel free again, so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again
For sure... I'll find another you

Could you imagine someone else is by my side?
I've been afraid I couldn't keep myself from falling
My heart was always searching for a place to hide
Could not await the dawn to bring another day

You're not the only one so hear me when I say
The thoughts of you, they just fade away

'Cause I can breathe again, dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now I feel free again, so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again
For sure... I'll find another you

Sometimes I see you when I close my eyes (Oh~~!)
You're still a part of my life...

But I can breathe again, dream again
I'll be on the road again
Like it used to be the other day
Now I feel free again, so innocent
'Cause someone makes me whole again
For sure... I'll find another you, mm...

Oh, I'll find another you
