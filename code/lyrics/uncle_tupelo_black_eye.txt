Song:

Do you fear this man's invention
That they call atomic power
Are we all in great confusion
Do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion
May rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction
Blotting out the works of man
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high
Are you ready for that great atomic power
There is one way to escape
And be prepared to meet the lord
When the mushroom of destruction fallsthere is a shielding sword
He will surely stand beside you
And you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
And eternal peace and rest
Are you, are you ready
For that great atomic power
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air
Will you shout or will you cry
When the fire rains from on high
Are you ready for that great atomic power
