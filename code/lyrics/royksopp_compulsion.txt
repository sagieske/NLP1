Song:

I never meant to be this way
Never thought that I could change
Till you woke me with your touch
And now they see it in my eyes
You're the craving of my life
Want you more than words can say

You're in my head
In my head

You touch my skin, you keep me warm
Bring me closer to the sun
You're the reason I desire
I feel serenity and more
Every ways of gentle love
Soothing whispers from the stars, oh

You're in my dreams, 
In my dreams

Such a simple mind and lost
Be the once love above
Change your winter for you stop
This is where I want to be
No anxiety you feel
Quiet moment when you're close

If you could see just what I see
If you could see just what I see
If you could see just what I see
If you could see just what I see
Would you believe?
