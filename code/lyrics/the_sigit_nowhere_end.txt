Song:

I hope we could be all right again
Smoke and laugh at my cigarette brand
I hope we could drive nowhere end
Listen to yours and my favorite band

I hope we could be all right again
Smoke and laugh at my cigarette brand
I hope we could drive nowhere end
Listen to yours and my favorite band

I don't have to tell you what I'm feeling (what I'm feeling)
Don't need to know
For whom your feeling is
I just really want to see your face again (see your face again)
And those smile
I've seen when your crying

I hope we could be all right again
Smoke and laugh at my cigarette brand
I hope we could drive nowhere end
Listen to yours and my favorite band

I don't have to tell you what I'm feeling (what I'm feeling)
Don't need to know
For whom your feeling is
I just really want to see your face again (see your face again)
And those smile
I've seen when your crying

And when we drink together
I will hold my thirst
I will hold my last to get higher
And when we drink together
We will hold my lust
So I could drive you to get higher
