Song:

Hey
What's your name?
Don't worry
Don't be afraid
We won't hurt you

Hey
Lost your way?
Don't worry
Just do as we say
And we won't hurt you

It's hard
The world can lead you so astray
It gets harder
It's hard just to keep the faith

Do you need a reminder
Of the love that we gave you?
Don't worry
You're walking away
But we'll always be watching you

(We'll always be watching you)
(We'll always be watching you)
