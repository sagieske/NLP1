Song:

I know you...
You don't have to say who you are
I've been watching you
From across the way
Across the way

You're not my type
But there's something about you tonight
You're makin' me dream about our love
The way you move...move

Four reasons
For loving me
Nobody has come to next to me
Don't walk away

Four reasons
For loving me
Nobody has come to next to me
Don't walk away

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

I know you
Even hough you don't even know my name
I've been waiting for you to walk my way
To walk my way

You're not my type
But there's something about you tonight
You're makin' me dream about our love
The way you move, move

Four reasons
For loving me
Nobody has come to next to me
Don't walk away

Four reasons
For loving me
Nobody has come to next to me
Don't walk away

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

Four reasons
For loving me
Nobody has come to next to me
Don't walk away

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh

'Cause I want you
And I need you
And I love you, and I...
I've got to have you
Baby don't look away
No don't, no don't
Ooh
