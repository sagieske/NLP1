Song:

She loves me again
All this time I kept to dream in my mind
There were things I had to learn, had to try
And I find her just the same

She loves me again
I have reasons then to come and to go
There were things I couldn't say
But believe in me

Can't you see it's all a game
I still love her just the same
She's as lovely as before
Now I want her even more

She loves me again
One year past, it hasn't changed anything
Time was lost but now we know so much more
Seasons change but love remains

Can' you see it's all a game
I still love her just the same
She's as lovely as before
Now I love her even more

She loves me again
On my own I kept to dream in my mind
All alone I have to learn
She loves me once again.
