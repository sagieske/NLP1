Song:

I saw you in the disco
Last night in San Francisco
The way you used your joystick
It really makes my mouse click

Come sit down on my laptop
Lets do a little hiphop
Let's go into a chatroom
And do a little boom boom

I saw you in the disco
Last week in San Francisco
The way you used your joystick
Has really made me feel sick

The doctor checked my harddrive
A virus in my archive
My disc was not protected
And now I am infected
