Song:

Let's it get on!
It's time to get in the game, You gotta fight til it hurts and then you do
It again
Let's tear it up!
I'm stayin straight to the core, ain't no room for second place, go big or
Go home!

Rise!
It's dog eat dog
Rise!
Man versus beast
Rise!
The strong will survive
Rise!
I've got no time for the Weak

It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, never been and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've gotta reach down, dig deep, and break ground, Show them all you
Won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more
Come back for more

It's do or die!
Time to settle the score, gotta give it all you got and then you give it
Some more
There will be blood
You've gotta fight til you break, talk a lot of trash and step up to the
Plate

Rise!
Refuse to give in
Rise!
Ashes to Dust
Rise!
Make 'em remember your name
Rise!
Cause in yourself I trust

It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, never been and won't be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've gotta reach down, dig deep, and break ground, Show them all you
Won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more!
Come back for more

Rah!

It's time to rise up, man up, get back up, never been and wont be broken
Dust off and then come back for more
You've gotta reach down, dig deep, and break ground, Show them all you
Won't be beaten
Brush it off and then come back for more
Come back for more

Rah!
