Wow ha-Ha 2011
Ze: A, ok
You know how we do it

Baby I'll never let you go
I just cry again and again

I don't know, I can't live
Sorichyeo oh No
Iyudo moreugo, imi da kkeutnan game

No way, what the hell don't know
Eoi eopseo niga mweorago

Nuga tto mweorago tteodeureo daedo
Ni mamdo moreugo
Geuge anigil baraesseo (anigil baraesseo)
Neon sarajyeosseo
Never let you go, That's my way
