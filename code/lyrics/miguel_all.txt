Song:

I just wanna have fun
Have fun and make money
Always on some I'll s**t
Around good people I could build with
Champion the ones that I'm near most
Fellow outcast and weirdos
I do it all without a co-sign
My f*****g mind is a gold mine

Write a book, go to school
Save a life, learn a language of a land
Love a little bit harder
Man watch when I get my whole dream imma
I can't wait to put my whole f*****g team on
Oh it's just a matter of time,
A matter of time
A matter of time
'Cause I ain't afraid to fail
Can't you tell, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all.

Tell me that it's selfish
But is it selfish?
I mean it could be kind of selfish
F*ck it everybody selfish, yeah

I just want the whole world to know it's real
Don't you hear my passion
Don't you see I'm I'll
So let me put you on this art s**t
You know, smart s**t
Help you bring your mind to a better place
Teach each other how to elevate
Yeah, elevate

Elevate, elevate
Elevate yeah
Oh it's just a matter of time,
A matter of time,
A matter of time, yeah
'Cause I ain't afraid to fail
Can't you tell I want it all
Want it all, I want it all
I want it all

Tell me that it's selfish
But is it selfish?
I mean it could be kind of selfish
F*ck it everybody selfish yeah
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all

Tell me that it's selfish
But is it selfish?
I mean it could be kind of selfish
F*ck it everybody selfish
I want it all

I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
