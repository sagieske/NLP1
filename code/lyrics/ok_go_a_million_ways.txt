Song:

Sit back, matter of fact
Teasing, toying, turning, chatting, charming
Hissing, playin the crowd

Play that song again
Another couple Klonopin
A nod, a glance, a half-hearted bow

Oh such grace
Oh such beauty
And lipstick and callous
And fishnets and malice
Oh darlin'

You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel

I should, i wish i could, maybe if you were i would
A list of standard issue regrets
One last eighty proof, slouchin' in the corner booth
Baby, it's as good as it gets

Oh such grace
Oh such beauty
So precious, suspicious, and charming and vicious
Oh darlin'
You're a million ways
Oh darlin'

You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel

Oh darlin'
Oh darlin'
You're a million ways
Oh darlin'
Oh darlin'
You're a million ways
Oh, darlin'
Oh darlin'
You're a million ways to be
Oh oh oh oh oh

(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)
You're a million ways to be cruel
(one zero zero zero zero zero zero cruel)

Oh darlin you're a million ways to be cruel.
