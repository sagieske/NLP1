Song:

All alone again [x2]

I speak as if I'd last one minute
With eyes not fixed upon this screen
Stalking the girls I could never f**k
I mean they're s***s but it seems I lack that luck
And I'm not the man to wash my hands
All alone or acting like we've hit it off
Cause either way I'm just jerkin someone off
At 2 am, dicks out and pissin'
Till you leave town wishing [No! ]
I won't be satisfied

[Chorus:]
Things are gonna be different now you see
And add to all this dirty laundry you left me
Its' getting air and with heavy rotation
You'd better have a damn good explanation

You act as though you have lived a lie
Because you're tans been overcooked
But I've been burned and burned
And burned and burned!

[Drum solo]

And now every single day,
I look more like my father
I've only got so many layers
And it's only getting hotter
2 am, dicks out and pissin'
Till you leave town wishing {No! }
I won't be satisfied

[Chorus x2]

I didn't mean to be so forward
There are some things you should know:
He loves you like a truck stop s***w
When you're alone he adores me
You'd best get it straight, say it.
When you're all dressed you just bore me [x2]

[Chorus x2]
