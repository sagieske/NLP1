Song:

You'd better sit down
I've got something to confess to you
I can make you walk out
But I think I owe us both the truth

We've been going through some changes
And it don't feel the way it felt
And before you even ask me
I have to say there's someone else

I'm in love with another man
The man you used to be when our love began
I'm in love with another man
The man you were and could be again

The man that I love
Would always let me know he cared
When it comes to us
You hardly let me know you're there

So can you really blame me
If he's the one who has my heart?
I just wish I could be with him
It hurts so much to be apart

I'm in love with another man
The man you used to be when our love began
I'm in love with another man
The man you were and could be again

I'm in love with another man
The man you were and could be again
