Song:

Transcribed by Michael "Calvin" Balonek

Follow the fold and stray no more,
Stray no more,
Stray no more,
Put down the bottle and we'll say no more,
Follow, follow the fold.

Follow the fold and stray no more,
Stray no more,
Stray no more,
Tear up your poker deck and play no more,
Follow, follow the fold.

To the meadows, 
Where the sun shines,
Out of the darkness, 
And the cold.

Follow the fold and stray no more,
Stray no more,
Stray no more,
If you're a sinner and you pray no more,
Follow, follow the fold.
