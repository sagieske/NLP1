Song:

Well how're the mountains off the harbor?
And how far are you from shore?
And when your ship
Oh when your ship comes into port
Would you call?
Oh would you call?

In that cabin in Montana
Was that donkey getting drunk?
Well it's been hell back here in Philadelphia, yeah
And York ain't what it was

Now you know grandpa's washing dishes
He does it when he can
Trying to get this fire started
And I could really use a hand

The dog is barking out back
He thinks he's in the band
Trying to get this fire started
And I could really use a hand

You know I dreamt where
We're at the station
And you asked me if you could go
You know I never really had the chance
To say no

Well it's night time in Alaska
I hear it's dark until the spring
Well it's been hell back here in Philadelphia, yeah
And York ain't what it was

Now you know grandpa's washing dishes
He does it when he can
Trying to get this fire started
And I could really use a hand

The dog is barking out back
He thinks he's in the band
Trying to get this fire started
And I could really use a hand

Well I dreamt where
We're at the station
And you asked me if you could go
You know I never really had the chance
Oh no
To say
