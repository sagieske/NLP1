Song:

Think about you make me feel right
To stand above all this beauty
To sing about the way I run away, from
The colour of desire in my head
Don't you know we can make it
You and me we could grow old
Something there's so significant, admit it
You'll never ever gonna bring me down

It's not a secret that I should keep
It's not a shame so I won't hide it
And all this pain I got from you is true, girl
My deepest thought is crying out loud
Don't you know we can make it
You and me we could grow old
Something there's so significant, admit it
You'll never ever gonna bring me down

Bad bad bad, the time is up again
Sad sad sad, my heart is burning red
You're miles away, I wonder why
All those 10 days,
That's all I have inside

Bad bad bad, I hurt you once so bad
Sad sad sad, if I just could make it right
Be stronger now cause you'll be back
Close my eyes and
It's worth a thousand kiss

I remember when we drunk
It was just so much fun
But time goes by so fast

Think about you make me feel brave
To fight alone all this beauty
To sing about the way I run away, from
This devil deep inside my soul
Don't you know we can make it
You and me we could grow old
Something there's so significant, admit it
You'll never ever gonna bring me down

Bad bad bad, the time is up again
Sad sad sad, my heart is burning red
You're miles away, I wonder why
All those 10 days,
That's all I have inside

Bad bad bad, I hurt you once so bad
Sad sad sad, if I just could make it right
Be stronger now cause you'll be back
Close my eyes and
It's worth a thousand kiss

I remember when we drunk
It was just so much fun
But time goes by so fast
