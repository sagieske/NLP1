Song:

Press record, cuz here less is more
Than before when everything in the store cost a quarter
Fast the forward, get a cam record it
Now there's a berry that's born on every corner

Hot damn hoe here we go again
Got ammo to bust back my trusty pen
The winds are rushin', men and women are lustin'
How long do we got till it breaks?

Just depends on whether rim's the same price as jim's life
Right becomes wrong, wrong becomes right
Fight for life, cold winter breeze blow swift
Everyday is a gift bigger than box wrapped for Christmas

Some say why do I tell my story?
Tell them you saw me alone wit' mic talkin' 'bout life

And you know just shootin' the breeze
Humbly mumble to you people bout the birds and the bees
About the war overseas and they killin' our trees
It ain't goin' be nothin' left if we hate
Gotta believe

Cada-cada día yo veo la destruccion
Cada-cada día yo veo la maldicion
Cada-cada día yo veo la destruccion
Cada-cada día yo veo la maldicion

Won't it all go away, won't it all go away
This is, this is my world, this is, this your world
If you believe in my heart, this is, this is my world
This is, this our world, if we believe in our hearts
