Song:

Let me tell you a story
Story of a man
Who wants to be a god
God of the wind
He dressed to brown
Brown leather clothes
He used a bone mace
And ate mushrooms
He lived in the woods
There trees are huge
Only friends were trolls
Who were all the time drunk
He saw nightmare
There big bad bear
Ran behind him
And shouted these words:
[Chorus:]
If you want to be a god of wind
You have to beat me
If you want to be a god of wind
You must take my skin
If you want to be a god of wind
You must use my nails
If you want to be a god of wind
You must be like me, must be like bear
