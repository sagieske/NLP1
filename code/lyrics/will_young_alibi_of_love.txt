Song:

Strange how this language that I've learned
Still remains with me
Strange how it revisits my mind
To tear away fragments of sanity

Middle 8:
Terms of endearment
These rules of engagement
Love as its language
Still remains with me
Yet something that's hurting
This feeling that's burning
Keeps me hanging on with its words

Chorus:
This alibi of love
This alibi of love
Always disguised
Behind these eyes
I'm telling you this is so real

This pain is the hardest thing I own
It's not my decision
I'm scared you're here again
To lay this burden at my feet

(Middle 8)

[Chorus:]
This alibi of love....

Scats

[Chorus: X2]
This alibi of love....
