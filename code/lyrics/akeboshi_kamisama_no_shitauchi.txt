Song:

The sunlight burnt the air around my window pane, 
In broken dreams I feel the fear of night again
I'm lost without a place, without home or womb, 
It's empty objects now that hold me in this room, 

She said she read my eyes and danced me to the floor, 
But in her shadow stood the devil at the door, 
The smile that hid her life was thin and strainging fast, 
Her carefree movements masked the truths whitin her past

Just close your eyes and see what you can see
Just close your eyes and see what you can see

The sunlight burnt the air around my window pane, 
In broken dreams I feel the fear of night again
And God he clicks his tongue in a moment of silence
This tearless story unfolds while her tears roll down

Just close your eyes and see what you can see
Just close your eyes and see what you see
Just close your eyes and see what you can see
Just close your eyes and see what you can be
