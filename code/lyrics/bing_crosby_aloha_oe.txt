Song:

Proudly swept the rain by the cliffs
As on it glided through the trees
Still following with grief the liko
A hihi lehua of the vale

Aloha oe, aloha oe
Thou charming one who dwells among the bowers
One fond embrace, before I now depart
Until we meet again

One fond embrace, before I now depart
Until we meet again
