Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break (x3)
Make ya back break baby
Baby baby baby...
Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break (x3)
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break
Make ya back break

Baby who I be
You already know
You can find me in the club
Or see me at a show
Sippin on bub
Fillin in the corner
Party going on
Come join if you wanna

Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands

S*** little thing
Saw you from a distance
So what's your name
Baby what you drinkin'
So come on over here and tell me what you're thinkin'
Baby look good I don't even wanna blink man

Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands

Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Your back break baby
Your back break
Back break

Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break (x3)
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break
Make ya back...

Baby go ahead
You can drop it low
Ain't no need to be afraid
Baby this is your show
Take you to the flo'
You know what I mean
You the baddest thing that this club has ever seen

Girl, shake it over here
Over there
To the front
To the rear
To the bottom
And to the middle
So give it to me
Give me just a little

Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands
Baby clap your hands
Let me see you clap your hands

Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Your back break baby
Your back break
Back break

Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break (x3)
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break
Make ya back...

Baby back break
Baby I'ma be ya doctor
It's all good baby I'ma fix you proper
So break your back I know you wanna
So go ahead I know you wanna
You look good to me everytime you shake it
So hot baby girl I can't take it
So let me see you make your back break
So let me see you make your back break baby

Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Shake it for me til your back break (x2)
I wanna see you make your back break baby
Your back break baby
Your back break
Back break

Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break (x3)
Make ya back break baby
Make ya back break
Make ya back break baby
