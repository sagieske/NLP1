Song:

I? Ve lived in apartments, I? Ve lived in a home
I travelled in trailers when I used to roam
But now in these places you won? T have me dead
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I do what I want to; no worries, no care
If anyone bugs me I climb little stairs
Way up to a level where I feel no threat
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

The stair climbing's nothing, I couldn? T care less
I don? T rush for busses and trains are a mess
There? S no one to care for, I don? T make a bed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I like how I? M living, I? M nobody? S slave
My head? S above water, so don? T make a wave
There's no door to lock and no dog to be fed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

So why should I move when the neighborhood? S right?
No taxes to pay and no landlord to fight
Now I call this living, what? S more, like I said
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head

Now you keep your ulcers, your ills, and what's new
You sure couldn? T have them and live like I do
You think I have problems, but you do instead
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I live with two people, I like both of them
He likes both of me and I like both of him
They? Re my alter-egos and to them I? M wed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

There? S no civil status in my neighborhood
And its that kind of thinking, that keeps it so good
I don? T take the lead but I like to be led
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I? Ve lived in apartments, I? Ve lived in a home
(so why should I move when the neighborhood's right?)
I travelled in trailers when I used to roam
(No Taxes to pay and no landlord to fight)
But now in these places you won? T have me dead
(Now I call this living, what? S more, like I said)
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head {together}

I do what I want to; no worries, no care
(now you keep your ulcers, your ills, and what's new)
If anyone bugs me I climb little stairs
(you sure couldn't have them and live like I do)
Way up to a level where I feel no threat
(You think I have problems, but you do instead)
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head {together}

The stair climbing's nothing, I couldn? T care less
(I live with two people, I like both of them)
I don? T rush for busses and trains are a mess
(he likes both of me, and I like both of him)
There? S no one to care for, I don? T make a bed
(They're my alter-egos and to them I'm wed)
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head {together}

I like how I? M living, I? M nobody? S slave
(There's no civil status in my neighborhood)
My head? S above water, so don? T make a wave
(And it's that kind of thinking that keeps it so good)
There's no door to lock and no dog to be fed
(I don't take the lead, but I like to be led)
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head {together}

So why should I move when the neighborhood? S right?
(I've lived in apartments, I've lived in a home)
No taxes to pay and no landlord to fight
(I travelled in trailers when I used to roam)
Now I call this living, what? S more, like I said
(But now in these places you won't catch me dead)
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head {together}

Now you keep your ulcers, your ills, and what's new
(I do what I want to; no worries, no cares)
You sure couldn? T have them and live like I do

(What'd he say?)
What'd he say?
(Do you know what he said?)
I don't know what he said!
(No, I don't know what he said!)
