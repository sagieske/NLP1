Song:

I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head
I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, Try to forget it
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I'm feeling stressed
And I need to do something
I f****d up for nothing
Now I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

Please bathe me now, Wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline

Oh no, Like Gasoline

I wake up, the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try
You deserve forever
Not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I'mma try to keep you near

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline

Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like Gasoline
