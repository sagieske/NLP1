Song:

I may burn out like a candle and
I may pass away
I may fall just like a shooting star
My heart will stay
I'll be yours until forever,
Forever I'll be true to the promise
I have made from the day that
I found you
Forever your in my heart
Even if were apart

I say, forever I'll be yours
Forever I love you
I say, forever I'll be yours
Forever I'll be true
My love will never fade away
Even if I'll die and
I will love you until the end of time
Even without your smile

So hear me please I beg you
Don't walk away I need you
Just stay with me and be by my side
Take my hand and we'll work it out

Until, forever I'll be yours
Forever I love you
I say, forever I'll be yours
Forever I'll be true
My love will never fade away
Even if I'll die now
I love you until the end of time
Even without your smile

So hear me please
I beg you
To stay...
