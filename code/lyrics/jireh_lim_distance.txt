Song:

Baby, I wish you’re here right next to me,.
But you’re miles and miles away from me, 
Your sweet voice on the phone, 
Brings sweet melody to my ears, 
I could spend my day just listening to it, 

Time will come the day we’ll be together again, 
And all the waiting will be worth it for sure, 

Maybe I thought for once that you and I will never work, 
But I am holding on to your heart over a pleasure to meet, 

I am surrounded by ones that are closer, 
But all I can see is you, 
Staring smiling at me, 
I would never break this promise, 
Until the day you say don’t bother coz you found another, 

I never thought we’ll be stronger.
From sunlight to moonlight.
Everyday I long for your touch and kiss, 
Only in my dreams I could get closer to you anytime, 
Coz there I can fly for free.

Why oh why do I have to be so far away, 
But for someone like you I’m willing to stay, 

Maybe I thought for once that could find another you, 
But as you see I was wrong cause there is no one like you, 

I am surrounded by ones that are closer, 
But all I can see is you, 
Staring smiling at me, 
I would never break this promise, 
Until the day you say don’t bother coz you found another, 

Sooner I’ll be by your side, 
And everything will be worth the wait.

Maybe I thought for once that could find another you, 
But as you see I was wrong cause there is no one like you, 

I am surrounded by ones that are closer, 
But all I can see is you, 
Staring smiling at me, 
I would never break this promise, 
Until the day you say don’t bother coz you found another,
