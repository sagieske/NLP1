Song:

Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for
There's nothing to die for

Cause I'm burying my sins
I'm a prisoner and waiting
I'm drowning within
When the world is all I'm hating
This is my hell

We conform from underground
We arise from your defenses
Through this constitution revolution end

Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still ganna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for

If I cannot be saved
Then my pride is for the taking
If this is my grave
I will close my eyes awaking
Everything is red

We conform from underground
We arise from your defenses
Through this constitution revolution end

Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still ganna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still ganna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for

Pero mi pais
(But my country)
Todo por mi pais
Todo por mi pais
Todo por mi pais
(Everything for my country)

Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still ganna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for
(There's nothing to die for)
When everything comes down

Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still ganna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for
