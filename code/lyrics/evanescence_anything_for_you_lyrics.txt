Song:

I'd give anything to give me to you
Can you forget the world that you thought you knew

If you want me
Come and find me
Nothing's stopping you so please release me

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you

Nothing left to make me feel anymore
There's only you and everyday I need more

If you want me
Come and find me
I'll do anything you say, just tell me

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
Anything for you

Overcome your urge inside
Forever never die
I'll be everything you need

I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
I'll believe all your lies
Just pretend you love me
Make believe, close your eyes
I'll be anything for you
