Song:

Look at yourself and the mirror pretends
What you see is superman
Marvel comic heroes to go
Goin' up the wall like spiderman

All the bodies are invited
All the bodies are excited

Think your Mr. Know it all
Nothin' but a poster on the wall
Sendin' my kid on off to war
Takin' my money and you still want more

All the bodies are invited
All the bodies are excited

All the bodies are invited
All the bodies are excited
All the bodies are invited
All the bodies are excited
