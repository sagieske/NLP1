Song:

(dwight yoakam)

Don't look inside. No don't look there
'cause you might find yourself somewhere
Walkin' round lost and alone
Without one clue that it's a long way home

Years and years is a lot of time
To drag your heart across every rock you find
Hate is deep and it's pull is strong
But the passion's short then it's a long way home

I can't take one single step for you
But I might just help to find some small pathway through

Don't look back 'cause you might see
Just how far all that used to be

Just let your mind think on what's gone
And then you'll know that it's a long way home

Yeah, you'll know that it's a long way home
You'll find out that it's a long way home
There ain't no doubt that it's a long way home
