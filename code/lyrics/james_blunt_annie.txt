Song:

Annie, you had your name in the bright lights.
I thought I saw your photograph having such a laugh in a magazine,
Did it all come tumbling?
Annie, you were made for the big time.
They said you're a star to be in the NME,
But the walls came tumbling down, down. Will you go down on me?
'Cause Annie you're a star, that's just not going very far.
And all the world will know your name,
And you'll be famous as you are 'cause I'll sing for you.
Annie, would it be nice to be recognised?
And did you practise your autograph but now no one's asked and it's such a shame,
That the dreams are crumbling?
Annie, why aren't you bathed in the limelight?
'Cause I thought that you said you'd be a celebrity several years ago.
Did it all come tumbling down, down. Will you go down on me?
'Cause Annie you're a star, that's just not going very far.
And all the world will know your name,
And you'll be famous as you are 'cause I'll sing for you.
