Song:

Into a strange new world, into the after
All your tears might find you've fallen too far
And I still believe in nothing
Take another look, take another ride
Can't we make them leave the hate behind
Will we ever see the shape of tomorrow?
Into the empty storm, into the formless loss of hope,

Will we ever see the cure for our sorrow

And I still believe in nothing
Where we can forget the game
Nothing is sacred when no one is saved
Nothing's forever so count your days
Nothing is final and no one is real

Nothingpray for tomorrow and find your empty still
