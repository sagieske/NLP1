Song:

They painted up your secrets

With the lies they told to you

And the least they ever gave you

Was the most you ever knew



And I wonder where these dreams go

When the world gets in your way

What's the point in all this screaming

No one's listening anyway



Your voice is small and fading

And you hide in here unknown

And your mother loves your father

'Cause she's got nowhere to go



And she wonders where these dreams go

'Cause the world got in her way

What's the point in ever trying

Nothing's changing anyway



They press their lips against you

And you love the lies they say

And I tried so hard to reach you

But you're falling anyway



And you know I see right through you

'Cause the world gets in your way

What's the point in all this screamin'

You're not listening anyway
