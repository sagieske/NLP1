Song:

Listen up people on the beacha,
Bout Phineas and Ferb in the backyard beach,
Every mornin' Phineas he gonna say,
Brother what you gonna do today,
Now you see were have fun playing under the sun,
Get in line... Get in line cause the wet skis runnin,
My backyard beach... My backyard beach,
Nothing's out of reach in the backyard beach,
You can change in the broken hut,
Drink out of a coconut,
3 game for a token but the rest is free,
You got skiing... Para sailing,
Surfing and a flailing put our contacts in saline or the rest you can't see,
At the backyard beach... At the backyard beach,
Nothing's out of reach at the backyard beach,
The backyard beach... The backyard beach,
Don't fall into the breech at the backyard beach!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
