Song:

Hot... Aww!

You can keep your black tongue!
Well, I found at the mortuary
You know I'm gonna want some, want some, ah
We're high in the backroom, gonna have a pack soon
With this you will regret
Just let it be, yeah yeah yeah

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (x3)

Sonny kept his ring on
Red tape so ordinary
Love, acting like it was gone, gone, gone, gone, ah
Let's do this like a prison break,
I wanna see you scream and shake!

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!

Boy you just a stupid b***h
And girl you just a no good d**k (X 3)

Hot... Aww!

We're gonna keep it in the family!
Yeah, well, you know we're on the run
You know you gonna want some, want some, ha
We're high in the backroom, gonna have a pack soon
With this you will regret
Just let it be, yeah yeah yeah

Boy you just a stupid b***h
And girl you just a no good d**k (X 3)
