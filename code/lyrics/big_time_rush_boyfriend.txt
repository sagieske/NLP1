(Yeah)
And it isn't anything they could have said or done
(Said or done)
And everyday I see you on your own
And I can't believe that your alone
But I overheard your girls and this is what they said
Looking for a

(To find the right words)
So when I kick it you it ain't something that you've heard

I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer
But I know I gotta put myself forward
See I think I've got the kind of love that you deserve and I heard that...

Don't be scared come put your trust in me
Can't you see all I really want to be is your boyfriend

Your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy friend
Your boy boy b-b-boy b-b-boy friend
