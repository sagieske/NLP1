Song:

Days and nights
Without a reason
That was called my life
I'd give all I know
To keep one hello from saying goodbye
Then our eyes met
When our eyes met
I began to live again

[Chorus]
All because of the time
That you gave to me
Time is standing still until
Together we'll be
Somewhere some way somehow
Everything is new
And it's all because of you

It takes a special kind of artist
Look at what you've drawn
Eyes that shine
Reflecting you and a heart
With heartache all gone
Let me hold you cause when I hold you
Dream becomes reality

[Chorus]
All because of the time
That you gave to me
Time is standing still until
Together we'll be
Somewhere some way somehow
Everything is new
And it's all because of you

You ask
Can this be real
I know what I feel
Heaven knows what I love
God sent you from above
You're all I'm thinkin' of

[Chorus]
All because of the time
I know time is standing still until
Together we'll be
And there's a world out there
'Til now I never knew
And it's all because
It's all because of you
All because of you [3 x]
