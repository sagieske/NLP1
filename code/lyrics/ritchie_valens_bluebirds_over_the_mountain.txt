Bluebirds over the mountain
Sea gulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me

Boy and girl they fell in love
Each was like the heavens above
He looked in her eyes of blue
She vowed to him that she'd be true

Bluebirds over the mountain
Sea gulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me

I miss you, oh can't you see?
You're the only girl for me
Soon you're gone
And I'm all alone

Come on, baby
Come back home

Bluebirds over the mountain
Sea gulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me

Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to me

Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to me

FADES-

Well-well-well
Bring my baby back to me.
