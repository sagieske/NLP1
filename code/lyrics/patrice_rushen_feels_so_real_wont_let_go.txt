Song:

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go

It is a night I won't forget
The kind you dream of
Sweet candlelight, the mood is set
I'm ready for love

Your kiss, your sweet embrace
I'll never be the same
Are you my dream come true
You just thrilled me so, won't let go

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is this my dream come true)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go

So close to you and yet so far
It tears me apart
I wish you knew my happiness
Is there where you are

For you I'll be true
And it will be the same
We kiss and on like this
Love will surely grow, don't let it go

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is this a dream come true)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)

It feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Whoa, whoa)
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)

Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love
Does it seem that love is just a dream
Give it up

Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love (Feels so real)
Does it seem that love is just a dream
Give it up (My love is comin' on strong)

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is my love for you)
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is this a dream come true)

It feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Whoa, whoa)
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go

Feels so real
No matter what I do, it feels so real, so real, so real
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go

Givin' love, just the two of us
Makin' love (Feels so real)
Does it seem that love is just a dream
Give it up (My love is comin' on strong)

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Yeah)
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Is this my dream come true)

It feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do is this a dream come true)
It feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Oh... Ho... Oh...)

Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (Whoa... Oh... Ho... Ho... Yeah)
Feels so real
And my mind won't let go (No matter what I do)

It feels so real (So real)
And my mind won't let go
