Song:

This is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With the same old blues

Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And when I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, oh me

Just because of you, boy
Just because of you whoa, oh, oh
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you

I got the same old friends
And they've got the same old sins
I tell them the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins

But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Everyday of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew

Just because of you
Just because of you, whoa, oh, oh, oh
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you

I go to the same old places
I see the same old faces
I look at the same old sky
See it all with brand new eye

I got a brand new boy
And I got me a brand new smile
Since I found you, baby
I got me a brand new style

Just because of you, boy
Just because of you, oh, I feel good
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you, oh, I feel good

Just because of you, boy
Hey, just because of you, yes, I do
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you, oh, it feels good

Just because of you, boy
Yeah, just because of you
Just because of you, boy
Just because, because, because of you

Just because of you, boy
Ooh, boy
Just because of you, boy
Ooh, boy
Just because of you, boy
Ooh, boy
