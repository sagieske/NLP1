Song:

On that snowy bright December day
She came and took my breath away
It was there I met my love so fair
A beauty oh so true and rare

Chorus: 

For who we are and what we'll be
I'ii sing your praise eternally
When I was lost you carried on
When I was weak you kept us strong

You walk the line so gracefully
Of friendship, love and loyality
In troubled time you did your best
Of lesser strenght I must confess

Repeat Chorus--

As seasons come and seasons pass
The bond we know will always last
We built a life remaining true
I pledge my heart and soul to you

Fo who we are and what we'll be
I'll sing your praise eternally
The miles we've shared I'd trade but few
They're the ones thet kept me away from you

On that snowy bright December day
You came and took my breath away
It was there I met my love so fair
A beauty oh so true and rare
