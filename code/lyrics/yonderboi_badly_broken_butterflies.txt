Song:

Pictures of my mind
Then I can't forget
Pictures of us
I neither can forget

Those old pictures
I wish I could
I wish I could
Forget

Take the way it is ain't no need to consider
Don't care what you did
You are only a consumer
Prisoner to drugs and sweets
Free market for love and peace
But don't forget the heartbeats
How the heart really beats
My consolation is your endlessness
How does it feel to succeed less and less
What helps me to survive is your sickness
You badly broken butterflies
You poor princess
