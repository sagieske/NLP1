Song:

Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

Borders are the gallows
Of our collective national egos
Subjective, lines in sand
In the water, separating everything

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

Here's my song for the free
No, it's not about praise and publicity
Corprotocracy, what a hypocrisy
Aristocrasy versus democracy

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

The king is dead and now
We're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise
We're merely covering our feet

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

Fear is the cause of separation
Backed with illicit conversations
Procured by constant condemnations
National blood-painted persuasions

The king is dead and now we're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise, we're merely covering our feet

Your gods are dead and now we're dancing in the streets
As the waters rise, we're merely cowering in defeat

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go
I never let you go

Never let you go
I never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go

Never let you go
I never let you go
Never let you go
Never let you go
