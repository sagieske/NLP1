Song:

I remember the time when I met you
We were so young and I was so unsure
Didn't even know the meaning of love
Although I felt something inside me

Bridge I
That's not the way how we planned it
And not the way it used to be
That's not the way how we wanted it
So we have to say goodbye
All these feelings I can't hide

I remember all those times, when we were so in love
Thought that it's forever and forever you are mine
I remember all those days when we were makin love
Nothing's been the same my baby, since you've been gone

I still dream about you

My heart still beats when I see you around
I know you've got someone beside you now
But if you need me I'm still there for you

Why do we have to say goodbye
Why do you put these tears in my eyes
Days feel like years when you're not around
It hurts me inside baby
Deep down inside me

Repeat hook 2x
Bridge ii:
I am still hopin that there will come a time
I'll feel you and touch you, just kiss you
All through the night

Repeat bridge 1, hook
