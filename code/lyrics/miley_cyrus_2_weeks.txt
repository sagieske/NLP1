Verse 1:
Two weeks from now we'd be kissing.
Two weeks from now I'd be missing.
Two weeks from now you'd be listening.
Two weeks from now ow ow.
Two weeks from now we'd be together.
Two weeks from now I'd be better.
Two weeks from now you'd be forever.
Two weeks from now ow ow.

Chorus:
The wait is just too long.
We just gotta stay strong.
It's only fourteen days.
Till my dreams become reality.

Verse 2:
Two weeks from now we'd have fun.
Two weeks from now I'd be in the sun.
Two weeks from now you'd be the one.
Two weeks from now ow ow.
Two weeks from now we'd last for time.
Two weeks from now I'd be paralised.
Two weeks from now you'd be mine.
Two weeks from now ow ow.

Chorus x1

Chorus #2:
It's been two weeks.
Just kiss don't speak.
The wait was worth it.
All the time we skipped.

Verse 3:
Two weeks from then and we're great.
Two weeks from then and not late.
Two weeks from then and we're kissing.
Two weeks from then and we're listening.
Two weeks from then en en.
Two weeks from then and we're together.
Two weeks from then and we're forever.
Two weeks from then and we're laughing.
Two weeks from then and we're bragging.
Two weeks from then en en.

Chorus #2

Two weeks from now.
We'll make it some how.
