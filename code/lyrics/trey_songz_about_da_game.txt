Song:

It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game

Ride and low
(Ride and low)
Lay back in the seats and creep
That's just how I roll

With some fresh nice ones on ma feet
This is how we go
(This is how we go)
And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo
'Cause it ain't about that no more

It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game

It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am life that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game

Look at me
(Look at me)
When you ask why I sit in the streets, that's who I be
Yo, I live for the duo for feelin' free

They are too many other dudes
You can choose that got this luxury
But without it all
(All the haters want to hate me)
But just nuthin'
(But the ladies just want to love me)
And they love me for what I do

It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game

It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am life that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game

Ride and low
(Ride and low)
Lay back in the seats and creep
That's just how I roll

With some fresh nice ones on ma feet
This is how we go
(This is how we go)
And I'm tryin' to find a chick who ain't about the duo
'Cause it ain't about that no more

It ain't about the rims on ma truck
Ain't about the ice on ma watch
Ain't about the coup on ma truck
Baby, it's about the game

It ain't about the shows that I f***
Ain't about the duo or ma rocks
And am life that I live it don't stop
Baby, it's about the game
