Song:

This is the story that time forgot.
And though some names have been changed,
Some names, some names have not.
Tune in every night at six o'clock
You can open up a magic box and see me there.
Ready or not, here I come, I'm free.
I got so many names,
Let Lucifer Longtail suffice,
So many faces, so many devices in the
Sweet smile of the talk-show host
To the suicide celebrity ghost.

That's me, yeah,
The ace in the hole of America's soul.
Adore, adore
Bow down before.
Bow down before.
Adore, adore.
A star is born, you start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me.

And we already know the news is born and sold
By the man with the plan and the corporate gold.
And we already know that the story can change
At the roll of a dice, reality rearranges.
That's me, yeah
I'm everywhere you did not think I could be so,
Adore, adore.
Bow down before.
Bow down before.
Adore, adore.
A star is born, you start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me.

And I'll be there in the secrets that you dream in.
And I'll be there when you wake up in the morning.
And I'll be there when you get home in evening.
'Til the days of your life is done.

This is the song that the caged bird sings,
Curled up like a cat at the corner of everything.
Don't feel bad even if you could,
'Cuz if you did not do it,
Someone else just would.
It's... Easy.
Believe. Me.
I'll show you such wonderful things.
I'll show you such wonderful things 'til you're just like me.

Adore, adore.
Bow down before.
Bow down before.
Adore, adore.
A star is born, you start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me.

Adore, adore.
Bow down before.
Bow down before.
Adore, adore.
A star is born, you start to fall
Down on your knees
And adore me.

Adore. Adore.
Bow down. Before.
Adore. Adore.
Bow down. Before.
Adore. Adore.
Bow down. Before.
Adore. Adore.
Bow down before.
Adore.
