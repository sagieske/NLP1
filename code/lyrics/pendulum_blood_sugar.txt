Song:

Ladies and gentlemen,
We understand that you,
Have come tonight,
To bear witness to the sound of Drum and Bass.
We regret to announce,
That this is not the case,
As instead, we come tonight to bring you,
The sonic recreation of the end of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Prepare to hold your colour.

Okay, f**k it, I lied.
It's Drum and Bass.
What you gonna do?
