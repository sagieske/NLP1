Song:

Red gates of iron cast their
Black shadows on this land
Dividing souls... Far below
The gathering winds the armies watch
Are rising from the west
Foretelling news... Of freedoms hand

In secrecy theyve infiltrated
All of our strongholds
Controlling more... Year after year
So weve let this happen all along
Believing whats been said
Our leaders cry... We have no one to fear

We watch the sun rise, and hope
We watch the sun rise, and hope
That it wont be our last
Before the storm
Before the storm
Before the storm
Before the storm

Is it late to try, must we all die
Our system awaits testv freedom by choice...
Is it for all men, best
So we wait in fear the atom split
Our hearts in two be torn
Learn from the past... Before the storm

We watch the sunrise, and hope
We watch the sunrise, and hope
That it wont be our last
