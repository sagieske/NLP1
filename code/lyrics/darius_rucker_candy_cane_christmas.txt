Song:

Tiny little boots covered in snow
Apple cider warmin' on the stove
Tinsel twinklin' everywhere
Holly hangin' on the stairs
It must be Christmas Eve

Angels sittin' high upon a tree
Watchin' over presents patiently
Milk and cookies on a plate
Santa Clause is on his way
The kids should be fast asleep

Sleigh bells are ringin' in their heads
Twistin' like little tops in their beds
Tryin' to sleep but it's no use
With hoofs tap tappin' on the roof
Peakin' out the window to see what they can see
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be

The kids will wake up awfully early
'Cause they can't wait to see
If Santa made it so they can say
"Look what he brought me"

Sleigh bells are ringin' in their heads
Twistin' like little tops in their beds
Tryin' to sleep but it's no use
With hoofs tap tappin' on the roof
Peakin' out the window to see what they can see
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be
It's a Candy Cane Christmas
Sweet as it can be
