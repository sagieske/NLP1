Song:

How it all started, I hardly remember
A casual walk through the park in the winter
All that I wanted was someone I could talk to
It had to be you.

The wind was cold we hudled together
Looking bakc I should have known better
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look what I've done.

Chorus:
Gone too far, I don't know how I did it
Gone too far and I hate to admit it
But I spend all my time thinking of you
Gone too far, there's nothing I can do now
Gone too far, it'll work out somehow
But I spend all my time thinking of you

Seems before, I didn't know what was missing
Maybe I did, but I just wouldn't listen
Wasn't it me who said I'll never fall for anyone
And look What I've done.

Repeat 1st 3 lines of chorus
Adlib

Bridge:
Maybe somewhere along the line
I knew it would happen to me
Now I look in those smiling eyes
And for days now that's all I can see
