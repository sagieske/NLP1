Song:

There are tears in my soup
And I'm eating my sorrow
There is snot in my macaroni
It's salty

There was love in my life
And it binged on my sorrow
When I went to the restroom
It was purging

Bu-Bulimia Bulimia...

In the toilet of life
Are my tears and my sorrow
As I pull down the handle
They are swirling

To the sewers of life
Go my tears and my sorrow
And I'm empty of macaroni
After hurling

Bu-Bulimia Bulimia...
