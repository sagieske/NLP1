Song:

I see the fear in your eyes.
I fear the pain in your heart.
How can something so well put-together
Be so torn apart?

You are the beauty I want.
You are the angel I need.
I find the proof of God
In every single word that you speak.

You smell like girly shampoo
I love when I smell like you.
Reminds me why I wake up.

And if I tremble at the sight of you
It's not because I'm cold.
It's because I'm staring at
The girl I want to love me when I'm old.

I swear with all my heart
Every word I write for you is true
And I won't hesitate to give my all for you.

You are the stars in the sky.
You are the sound of the rain.
You are the strong sense of calm
That takes away all the pain.

You are the rush of the wind.
I'm just a man on his knees
Praying to God to grow old
With the girl of his dreams.

You've got my heart in your hand
You've got my hand if you want
So please love me forever.

And if I tremble at the sight of you
It's not because I'm cold.
It's because I'm staring at
The girl I want to love me when I'm old.

I swear with all my heart
Every word I write for you is true
And I won't hesitate to give my life for you.

And if I die before I wake
In the night just look above.
With every star that greets your face
I am giving you my love.

And if I die before I wake
In the night just look above.
With every star that greets your face
I am giving you my love.

Deep in the still of the night
I hear your voice in the dark.
It fills the empty spaces
Taking over my broken heart.

You give me strength to go on.
You rescue me from the pain.
I'm crazy for you 'cause your love
Kept me from going insane.

You stole my heart with one kiss.
Embraced my soul with your lips.
And I'm forever grateful.

And if I tremble at the sight of you
It's not because I'm cold.
It's because I'm staring at
The girl I want to love me when I'm old.

I swear with all my heart
Every word I write for you is true
And I won't hesitate to give my all for you.
