Song:

Lately I been praying I been talking to God but I been caught up in some serious doubt
I feel like I got cut and I can't stop the bleedin' but it's good I'm lettin' everything out
We were talkin' 'bout commitment how it weights on the soul
How it's grave and how it's scary as steel
How I've been looking for you since the day I was born
This is the way that I been tryin' to feel
And I just don't know what I'm gonna do
But I need to get to heaven 'cause I miss you
100 miles an hour with a dui you know they caught me on the 405
They pulled me over to the side of the road and said "you're lucky kid to still be alive"
Are you sure you want to take me home to meet your folks
When afterwards you know where I gotta go?
I been trying to convince you that I'm not that bad
But it's hard when you got nothing to show
And I just don't know what I'm gonna do
But I need to get to heaven 'cause I miss you
Well where your treasure is, is also your heart
You seek the kingdom and it's given to you
I know it's never worth it when you go out alone
You end up paying for the things that you do
So check it, I called her on the phone and told her everything
She was cool man she gave me some grace
Lord, don't let me mess it up this time, God just get me out of this place
'Cause I just don't know what I'm gonna do
But I need to get to heaven 'cause I miss you
