Song:

Deny resurrection, behead the nazarene son
Foredoomed holy spirit, our war at last be won
Legion crush jehovah, see through the faceless dog
Untie our world from Satan
You know it can't be done

Wipe away this world of unworth
Decapitation, Satanic rebirth
Off with his head to sever his soul
Beheaded prophet the suffer is yours
"Forever....."

Virgin, mother murdered, once warned but now is dead
Destroyed heaven's kingdom, in flames the righteous fled
Legion, thou has waited, beface the sacred dog
Satan's revelation, this world will always be ours

End of god the way it must be
Behead the prophet, let Satan free...

No god, no lord shall live
What always has should never been
No god, no lord shall live
Behead the prophet and we win

No man to begotten, infant Jesus dead
End of god forever, cast among the souls of Hell
Thou who has imprisoned, suffer by your own demise
Execrate the revelation, master satan rise!

Deny resurrection, behead the nazarene son
Foredoomed holy spirit, our war at last be won
Legion crush jehovah, see through the faceless dog
Untie our world from Satan
You know it can't be done

No god, no lord shall live
What always has should never been
No god, no lord shall live
Behead the prophet and we win

No man to begotten, infant Jesus dead
End of god forever, cast among the souls of Hell
Thou who has imprisoned,
Execrate the revelation,
Master satan rise!
