Song:

She's always in control
My beating heart she stole
I'm almost done with this
Can't take it no, no, no
She used to get me
But then lately it's been opposite of that
I'm going crazy and I want out of this mess
Step up to the plate like that

Swing, miss and you strikeout like that
You had your chance I'm not taking you back
When I leave I'm not looking back
You had your chance I'm not taking you back

We were like Jack and Rose
The credits start to roll
I thought I knew it all
But no, no, no, no
I used to play the fool
But now I see the consequence of that
I'm going crazy and you know I fight back

All this time I've been so blind with you
I should have seen it coming all along
This is goodbye our love capsized
Somehow I feel the weights just slip away
I'm breaking out, I'm breaking out
