Song:

(Herbert Lawson)
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel down hearted
That will prove your love for me is true.
Anytime you're thinking 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you.
Anytime your world is lonely
And you'll find true friends a few
Anytime you see a rainbow
That will be a sign the storm is through.
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
Anytime you're sure you want only my love
That's the time I'll come back home to you.
--- Instrumental ---
Anytime you're thinking 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you...
