Song:

I see
You've turned your back on love again
And I feel
Your stumbling downwards once again

And I feel
Despair kissing our lips again
And I feel
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah

Oh you hear
Me crying behind your back again
And you hear
My heart beat slowin' down again

And I feel
Despair kissing our lips again
And I feel
Despair holding our hearts again
I feel
Despair kissing our lips again
And I feel
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah

Oh baby yes I feel
Despair kissing our lips again
And I feel
Despair holding our hearts again
And I feel
Despair kissing our lips again
And I feel
Despair holding our hearts again, yeah

Despair holding our hearts again, oh
That's right
Yeah
