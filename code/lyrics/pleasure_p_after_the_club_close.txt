Song:

In this crowded place, we call the club, with you tonight
I can't even think straight for all the people up in my space tonight
If we were alone tonight in this club just you and I
Wouldn't it be so nice... Bring a little peace of mind
(Just want it to be you and I)

Chorus
Slow dance with me tonight after the club close
I wanna hold your body tight after the club close
We gone break the dj off to stay late after the club close
We gone get our freak on you and I after the club close

Now babysitter's waiting up for you at cha house tonight
And I know it's really getting late but that's alright
(Baby girl ya know it took us a while)
It took us a while to get the dj to stay
(So why would we run away)
But now that we're here why run away
I want to get a little more then doing it with you tonight
Just want it to be you and I

Chorus
