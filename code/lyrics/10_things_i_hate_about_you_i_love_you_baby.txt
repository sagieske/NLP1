Song:

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby.
Trust in me when I say:
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you,...
