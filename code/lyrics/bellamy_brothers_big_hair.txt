Song:

My baby's got big hair
I see it flowin' down from everywhere
You may not like it son but I don't care
That girl was sent from up above
When I get tangled up in there
I feel just like a Texas millionaire
My baby's got big hair
She's the one I love

She's got a little old compact car
A mini-skirt that goes way too far
A tiny Airstream at the trailer park
The smallest dog you've ever seen
Now when she's wearin' them gogo boots
A tube-top and dark roots
She's so s*** and she's so cute
It makes a redneck wanna sing

My baby's got big hair
I see it flowin' down from everywhere
You may not like it son but I don't care
That girl was sent from up above
When I get tangled up in there
I feel just like a Texas millionaire
My baby's got big hair
She's the one I love

Last Friday night I took her on the town
She wore it high while we danced around
Later on you know she let it down
Behind the Dairy Queen
Someday soon I'm gonna change her name
Go down to Wal-Mart and I'll buy a ring
Walk down the isle with it untamed
A good old boy can only dream

My baby's got big hair
I see it flowin' down from everywhere
You may not like it son but I don't care
That girl was sent from up above
When I get tangled up in there
I feel just like a Texas millionaire
My baby's got big hair
She's the one I love

My baby's got big hair
She's the one I love
