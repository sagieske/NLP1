Song:

Turn Away, Turn Away
From Me, From Me
And I pray, yes I pray
For thee, for thee, for thee-ee-ee

Another World
Wrapped up inside another place
And I hope, and I pray
That the pain goes away,
Yes I pray, Yes I pray, for thee-ee-e> Turn Away, Turn Away
From Me, From Me
And I pray, yes I pray
For thee, for thee, for thee-ee-ee

Turn Away, Turn Away
From Me, From Me
And I pray, yes I pray
For thee, for thee, for thee
