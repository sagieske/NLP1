Song:

Distance can determine so many things
From new love to wedding rings
From staying or saying goodbyes
I've heard the stories
Of failure and glories
The warnings of one who will never ever try again
But hunny well make it yes we will
Although were miles part
I love you still
As long as you wait for me
Please save a space for me
Inside your arms I know it's been long
Darling stay strong for me
Just as the age of vines grows
So will our love our souls
I promise you we will make it through
As long as you wait for me
Wait for me
Please save a space for me
Inside your arms
I know it's been long
But darling stay strong for me
Just as the age of vines grow
So will our love our souls
I promise you
Well make it through
As long as you wait
Wait for me
