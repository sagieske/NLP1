Song:

Girl, you and me ain't talking much.
I just slam the door and leave in my truck.
Is there anything left for us?
I guess enough's enough.
I look down, see your name there on my phone then I hit ignore & just drive
On.
We've been living like this way too long.
And there ain't no reason to turn around.
Baby, you can have it all.

Cause I ain't, I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that.
And I'm done with you messing with my mind.
The last time was the last time, baby.
I can only change who I am so much, and all I can give is all my love.
And my love ain't never been enough.
So I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that.

Street after street & town after little down.
Feels like I'm on the right road now.
I bet you're wondering how, I could just walk out.
Cause I put you high up as I could.
And I know I've done everything I should, to try and make a bad thing good.
I guess it just took too long for me to see, that we ain't meant to be.

Cause I ain't, I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that.
And I'm done with you messing with my mind.
The last time was the last time, baby.
I can only change who I am so much, and all I can give is all my love.
And my love ain't never been enough.
So I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that.

Well I'll gas up & I'll start to second-guess myself.
And I'll crave your touch and that'll make it hard as hell.

But I ain't, I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that.
And I'm done with you messing with my mind.
The last time was the last time, baby.
I can only change who I am so much, and all I can give is all my love.
And my love ain't never been enough.
So, I ain't coming back.
No, I ain't coming back.
I've already been there, done that
