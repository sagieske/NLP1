Song:

Snowflakes fallin' everywhere
Christmas carols fill the air
Santa Claus is almost here
It's a very merry Christmas.

Children playin' in the lane
Echoes at my window pane
Santa Claus is here again
It's a very merry Christmas.

Hang your stocking and jump in bed
Close your eyes and cover up your head
Don't there peep cause if you do
Ol' Santa Clause might be watching you.

Christmas lights are green and red
Mistletoe hanging overhead
Fills my heart with happyiness
And the very merry Christmas.

Hang your stocking and jump in bed
Close your eyes and cover up your head
Don't there peep cause if you do
Ol' Santa Clause might be watching you.

Christmas lights are green and red
Mistletoe hanging overhead
Fills my heart with happyiness
And the very merry Christmas.
It's a very merry Christmas...
