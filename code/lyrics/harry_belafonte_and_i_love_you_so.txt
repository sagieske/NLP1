Song:

And I love you so though people ask me how
How I’ve lived till now, I tell them I don’t know
I guess they understand how lonely life has been
But life began again the day you took my hand

And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won’t set me free
But I don’t let the evening get me down
Now that you’re around me

And you love me too your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free, I’m happy that you do
The book of life is brief and once a page is read
All but love is dead that is my believe

And yes I know how loveless life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won’t set me free
But I don’t let the evening bring me down
Now that you’re around me

And I love you so though people ask me how
How I’ve lived till now, I tell them I don’t know
