Song:

Mush:
A pair of new shoes with matchin' laces!

Racetrack:
A permanent box at Sheepshead races!

Spot conlon:
A porcelain tub with boilin' water!

Kid blink:
A Saturday night with the mayor's daughter!

Racetrack:
Look at me
I'm the king of New York
Suddenly
I'm respectable
Starin' right at 'cha
Lousy with stature

Jack:
Nobbin' with all the muckety-mucks
I'm blowin' my dough and goin' deluxe

Racetrack:
And there I be
Ain't I pretty?

Racetrack and jack:
It's my city
I'm the king of New York!

Boots:
A corduroy suit with fitted knickers

Les:
A mezzanine seat to see the flickers

Snipeshooter:
Havana cigars that cost a quarter

David:
An editor's desk for the star reporter

Newsies:
Tip your hat
He's the king of New York

Denton:
How 'bout that!
I'm the king of New York

Newsies:
In nothing flat
He'll be covering
Brooklyn to Trenton
Our man Denton

Kid blink:
Makin' a headline out of a hunch

Denton:
Protecting the weak

Racetrack:
And payin' for lunch

Denton:
When I'm at bat
Strong men crumble

Racetrack:
Proud yet humble

Racetrack and denton:
I'm (He's) the king of New York

All:
I gotta be either dead or dreamin'
'Cause look at that pape with my face beamin'
Tomorrow they may wrap fishes in it
But I was a star for one whole minute

Startin' now
I'm the king of New York

Denton:
Ain't ya heard?
I'm the king of New York

All:
Holy cow
It's miracle
Pulitzer's cryin'
Weasel, he's dyin'
Flashpots are shootin' bright as the sun
I'm one highfalutin' son-of-a-gun
Don't ask me how
Fortune found me
Fate just crowned me
Now I'm king of New York
Look and see
Once a piker
Now a striker
I'm the king of New York
Victory!

Guts and glory
