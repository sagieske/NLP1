Song:

Wait, do you see
My heart on my sleeve?
It's been there
For days on end and
It's been waiting for you
To open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
And we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you
