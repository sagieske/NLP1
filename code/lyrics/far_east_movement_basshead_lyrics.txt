Song:

Give me that bass, make it bang
Boom, boom

Cruising down town with me and my crew
Girls on the sidewalk, how do you do?
I like your bass, that's something to s***w
If you're looking for a good time, follow the boom

Trip to the liquor store then to the crib
Knock on the door, damn look who it is
It's the L. A. Freaks with all that base
It's nothing like a hutchie with an 8o8

Pack that stump,... To the trunk
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you're a basshead
Girl you're a basshead, girl you're a bass head
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead
Go girl you're a bass head, yeah you're a basshead
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead

Pop, pop... Take a sip like... We the cool kids
Take a hit like cal on a cool hit
Cross fitted all day on the new s**t
Tripping out when the bass look real fat
She got a... Hit like a heart attack
Oh, girl got bass, with a nice shape,
Nothing like a hutchie with a 8o8

Pack that stump,... To the trunk
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you're a basshead
Girl you're a basshead, girl you're a bass head
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead
Go girl you're a bass head, yeah you're a basshead
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead

For my L. A. Creeps, no sleep, no tweeks, an L. A. Freak
... Fly tweets, 5 highness in the back seat
And the... Hell yeah, hell yeah
And the... Hell yeah, hell yeah, go girl

Pack that stump,... To the trunk
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you're a basshead
Girl you're a basshead, girl you're a bass head
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead
Go girl you're a bass head, yeah you're a basshead
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead

So, so fat, face so cute,... Taste like mango fruit
Heard you looking for a ballet, shot caller
She gave me her number but I'm not gonna call her
... I got to choose
Them boys... Now get high in the morning
Show no love for the suckers, I ain't never scared...
Said she love me but I don't trust her
Get rich and have 4... Mothers
Yeah, get hit or get lost,
I'm tryna be the same place,... Lip gloss
Now go girl, go...

Pack that stump,... To the trunk
And girl is a basshead, let me see you pump it
Yeah, get wasted, to the, to the pavement
Let me see you pump it, girl you're a basshead
Girl you're a basshead, girl you're a bass head
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead
Go girl you're a bass head, yeah you're a basshead
Let me see you pump it girl, you're a basshead
