Song:

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
Now, I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Kiss him once for me

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas
This year

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Kiss him once for me

Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh, by golly, have a holly jolly Christmas
This year

Santa Claus is coming to town
