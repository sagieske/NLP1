Song:

Perishing beside myself I lay
Better days I hope to see fade away
Unsure I woke up in this place
It was a long winding road from where I came

[Chorus:]
It seems in hindsight that I've known
That when I woke up your on
Well I can't see you that I knew
All that I have is you

Woke up inside an empty room
Hadn't lost gaping holes and sounds that move
Nothing I feel myself with do
The only thing I know I feel is you

[Chorus:]

I'm sorry when I can't see you (3x)

[Chorus:] (2x)
