Song:

We fought the truth
As long as we lived our love
Fearing all the solutions we found
We drowned ourselves
In the lake of tears theat we cried
'Til we found out that love is it's ground

Call me a fool, but I'm not
Our love changed - and love changed me

I kept waiting for your answer
Then I found out the answer was you
No more riddles of my longings
Now I Know that the answer is you

I want to thank you, my creator
I still wouldn't live my life without you
