Man! I Feel Like a Woman!

I'm going out tonight--I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise---really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

No inhibitions--make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only wanna have a good time

Bridge:
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and...

Chorus:
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy--forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts--short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild--yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action--feel the attraction
Color my hair--do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free--yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!

The girls need a break--tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance--we only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

I get totally crazy
Can you feel it
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm Holdin' on to Love (to save my life)

I don't need a shrink to tell me what to think
There ain't no missing link in my love life
It's alright, I ain't that upright
I don't need a psychic 'cause I don't really like it
When someone tries to tell me just what my future holds
I already know

Bridge:
Your love keeps me alive
You're all I need to survive
I got you by my side

Chorus:
So I'm holdin' on--I'm feelin' strong--baby you're the one
For all my life!
Yeah I'm holdin' out--there ain't no doubt--I can't live
Without
You all my life!
I'm holdin' on to love to save my life

I don't need to get all caught up on the net 'cause I'm already set
Can't you understand---already got my man
No I don't need proof to show me the truth, not even Dr. Ruth
Is gonna tell me how I feel--I know our love is real

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]

(I'm holdin' on to love to save my life)

[Bridge:]

[Chorus:]

Save me, save me, save me
Save my life

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Love Gets Me Every Time

Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry-- had no worries
Stayin' single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered--'til I discovered

Bridge:
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
I gol' darn gone and done it

Chorus:
Gone and done it (gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)
I guess I - - - gol' darn gone and done it

I was quite content
Just a-payin' my own rent
It was my place--I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I had it covered-- 'til I discovered

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Bridge:]

Chorus:
Gone and done it (gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (gone and done it)
Or his sweet, sweet talk (gone and done it)
It's in the way he calls my name (gone and done it)
I know I'll never be the same (gone and done it)

[Bridge:]

Thought I had it covered
Life was going great
Well I 'gol darn gone and done it

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't be Stupid (you know I love you)

You're so complicated--you hang over my shoulder
When I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys
You think they're on my tail

I get so aggravated when I get off the phone
And get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me
And you'll see

Bridge 1:
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax

Chorus:
Don't be stupid--you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous--you know I need you
Don't be absurd--you know I want you
Don't be impossible

Bridge 2:
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
Can't live without you (can't live without you)
I'm crazy 'bout you (I'm crazy 'bout you)
So don't be stupid--you know I love you

Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail

Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax--Max

[Chorus:]
(Bridge 2)

Don't be stupid-- you're my baby

(Bridge 2)
[Chorus:]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

From this Moment On

(I do swear that I'll always be there. I'd give anything
And everything and I will always care. Through weakness
And strength, happiness and sorrow, for better, for worse,
I will love you with every beat of my heart.)

From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on

From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on

I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I Iive
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on

You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Come on Over

Get a life--get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break--take control
Take advice from someone you know

Chorus:
Come on over---come on in
Pull up a seat--take a load off your feet
Come on over--come on in
You can unwind--take a load off your mind

Make a wish--make a move
Make up your mind--you can choose
When you're up--when you're down
When you need a laugh come around

[Chorus:]

Oh, oh, oh...

Be a winner--be a star
Be happy to be who you are
Gotta be yourself---gotta make a plan
Gotta go for it while you can

[Chorus:]

Get a life--get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break--take control
Take advice from someone you know

[Chorus:]

Oh, oh, oh...

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When

If elephants could fly I'd be a little more optimistic
But I don't see that happening anytime soon
I don't mean to sound so pessimistic
But I don't think that cow really jumped over the moon

Bridge:
When will I wake up?
Why did we break up?
When will we make up?

Chorus:
When money grows on trees
People live in peace
Everyone agrees
When happiness is free
Love can guarantee
You'll come back to me--that's when

I'd love to wake up smiling--full of the joys of spring
And hear on cnn that Elvis lives again
And that John's back with the Beatles and they're goin' out on tour
I'll be the first in line for tickets--gotta see that show for sure

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Whatever you Do! Don't!

Deep in Denialville
Tryin' a' fight the way I feel
I go jello when you smile
I start blushin'--my head rushin'

If you stand too close to me
I might melt down from the heat
If ya' look my way one more time
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Whatever you do. ..

Chorus:
Don't even think about it!
Don't go and get me started!
Don't you dare drive me crazy!
Don't do that to me baby!

You stop me in my tracks
My heart pumpin' to the max
I'm such a sucker for your eyes
They permanently paralyze
Whatever you do. ..

[Chorus:]

(Whatever you do, don't do that to me)
You got my heart under attack
You give me shivers down my back
D'ya have to walk the way you do?
I get weak just watchin' you
Whatever you do. ..

[Chorus:]

Don't do that-don't do that

-------------------------------------------------------------------

If You Wanna Touch Her, Ask!

Let me let you in on a secret
How to treat a woman right
If you're lookin' for a place in her heart
It ain't gonna happen overnight

First you gotta team to listen
To understand her deepest thoughts
She needs to know you can be friends
Before she'll give you all she's got

Bridge:
If you start from the heart
You'll see love is gonna play it's part

Chorus:
If you wanna get to know her
Really get inside her mind
If you wanna move in closer
Take it slow, yeah take your time
You must start from the heart and then...
If you wanna touch her
Really wanna touch her
If you wanna touch her, ask!

A little physical attraction
Romantic, old-fashioned charm
And a lot of love and tenderness
Is gonna get you into her arms

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Verse:]
[Chorus:]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

You're Still the One

(When I first saw you, I saw love. And the
First time you touched me, I felt love. And
After all this time, you're still the one I love.)

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

Bridge:
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

Chorus:
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
[Chorus:]

I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Honey, I'm Home

The car won't start--It's Falling apart falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows--got a run in my hose
My hair went fiat--man, I hate that (hate that)

Just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress--I must confess
This could be worse than pms

Bridge:
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait 'til the end of the day
Honey, I'm on my way
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Chorus:
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, gimme something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me
I need to relax and watch tv
Get off the phone--give the dog a bone
Hey! Hey! Honey, I'm home!

I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurts like hell
This job's a pain--it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

Oh, rub my neck will you

[Chorus:]

I'm home, that feels much better

-------------------------------------------------------------------

That Don't Impress me Much

I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius--you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

Bridge:
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else

Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brain but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve--just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place

[Bridge:]

Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much
So you got the looks but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
C'mon baby tell me--you must be jokin', right!

[Bridge:]

Okay, so you've got a car
That don't impress me much
So you got the moves but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

That don't impress me much
You think you're cool but have you got the touch
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much

Okay, so what do you think you're Elvis or something...
Whatever
That don't impress me

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Black Eyes, Blue Tears

Black eyes, I don't need 'em
Blue tears, gimme freedom

Positively never goin' back
I won't live where things are so out of whack
No more rollin' with the punches
No more usin' or abusin'

Bridge:

I'd rather die standing
Than live on my knees
Begging please--no more

Chorus:

Black eyes--I don't need 'em
Blue tears--gimme freedom
Black eyes--all behind me
Blue tears'll never find me now

Definitely found my self-esteem
Finally--I'm forever free to dream
No more cryin' in the corner
No excuses--no more bruises

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

I'd rather die standing
Than live on my knees, begging please...

[Chorus:]

It's all behind me, they'll never find me now
Find your self-esteem and be forever free to dream

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I Won't Leave You Lonely

Together--midnight in summer
The air's so much warmer
Falling in love under starlight
Holding on so tight--together

Chorus:
I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be alright
I won't leave you lonely tonight

Imagine--the air filled with jasmine
The breeze blows with passion
You and me dance with desire
The moon is on fire--imagine

[Chorus:]

Je t'aime beaucoup mon amour
You are the one I adore

I won't leave you lonely tonight
I want you to hold me all night
It's gonna be alright
No you won't be lonely tonight

Na-na-na...
Te amo mucho mi amor
You are the one I adore
Te amo

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Rock This Country!

I woke up this morning with a buzz rollin' 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinkin' but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious--looks like it's goin' around
It's cool once you catch it--you can't keep your feet on the ground

Bridge:
C'mon, c'mon--let's get something started
C'mon, c'mon--let's start something now

Chorus:
We're gonna rock this country
We're gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy--every blue eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho--give it a whirl
We're gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah-oo-na-na-na...

From Utah to Texas, Minnesota, Mississippi too
Or Nevada, no matter where you live--this buzz is for you

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

Ah-oo-na-na-na...

We're pluggin' in the power
Crankin' up the sound
It's comin' your direction
It's headin' to your town
We're kickin' up dust
Blowin' off steam
Let's get nuts now
Everybody scream

[Chorus:]

-------------------------------------------------------------------

You've Got a Way

You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say--you really got a way

You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see... You got a way with me

Chorus:
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what Iove's made of
It's in the way we make love

You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me

[Chorus:]

Bridge:
Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are

[Chorus:]

It's just the way you are

-------------------------------------------------------------------
