Song:

Mag:
Shilo?
Is your name Shilo?
Can I talk to you?
Can you come down please?

Shilo:
Why?

Mag:
So we can speak

I saw you at the show
I thought I'd seen a ghost
Your resemblance is striking

You have your mother's eyes, her hair
I was told you died with her
All these years have come and gone
How do I put this?
I'm your- Godmom

Shilo:
State your business

Mag:
Business?

Shilo:
What do you want?

Mag:
I want, I want to finally meet you
Something real to cling,
To leave you
With the hope that you will go do
All you're meant to,
All I failed to
In you is a world of promise
We have both been kept in bondage
But you could learn from all my failures

Shilo:
I'm not suppose to talk to strangers

Mag:
Or let them through the gate?

Shilo:
That either
A big risk

Mag:
A big fence

Shilo:
A big mistake

Mag:
A new friend

Marni:
Chase the morning
Yield for nothing
Chase the morning
Yield for nothing

Shilo:
Oh my god, mom!
How'd you do that?

Mag:
Do what?

Shilo:
Do that, that eye thing

Mag:
These eyes can do more than see

Shilo:
I know. I mean,
I've seen you sing

Mag:
Where?

Shilo:
From my window
I can see the world from there
Name the stars and constellations
Count the cars and watch the seasons

Mag:
I wish we could have watched together

Shilo:
I can't have guests

Mag:
Never?

Shilo:
Ever
If Dad found out that I'd been let out
Or that you'd been let in

Mag:
I should go then
Before I do
Promise me you won't

Shilo:
Better that you don't.

Mag:
Don't forget a sheltered rose
Needs a little room to bloom
Outside her bedroom

(Shilo:
It's best if I resume my life
Inside my bedroom.)

Marni:
Chase the morning
Yield for nothing
Chase the morning
Yield for nothing

Mag:
Let your life be a dream
Integrity, honesty
It's too late for me
Don't look back
'Till you're free to chase the morning

Marni:
Yield for nothing
Chase the morning
Yield for nothing
Yield for nothing
