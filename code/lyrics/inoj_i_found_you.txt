Song:

I've searched the world 'round and 'round
Never to find someone like you
People kept breaking my heart
I started to think love was untrue

Bridge 1
Then came you
>From above
When I was down you'd lift me up
Opened your key you were there
Showed me love said you cared
Baby

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

Baby so many times they would say that they would stay
All of my lifetime
And I believed every word
Until the day they said goodbye

Bridge 2
Then came you
You made it right
I couldn't breath you gave me life
And now I know love so true
Happiness being with you

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

Baby

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

Bridge 2

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

Chorus
I found love
Because of you I know
Cause of your love you've shown
Now I can give love back

I can give love back to you
