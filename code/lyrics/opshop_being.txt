Song:

Locked in a strange town
They'll make room for us somehow
Maybe a cheap caravan on the highest hill

With a view
Where I can float away with you
Away from the insides of this steeple
When and where we're getting old and feeble

[Chorus:]
And who
Who should come running now
Who would refuse to speak at every letter
You know it's better to move
The air will freeze before it gets better

But I can thaw
I can see the earth is calm but about to roar
From both inside and out my head's up in a rain cloud
And there's not much to laugh about

But then one day
There'll be nothin' but this thing we can't do without

And you
You should come running now
Yeah you
Your time is running out
It's better to lose
You know the air will freeze before it gets better

Hoo' huh'

[Instrumental]

Ooh' ooh' woah' oh'

And we don't wanna go to war again
Don't wanna go to war again
We don't wanna go to war again
Don't wanna go to war again
We don't wanna go to war again
Don't wanna go to war again' oh'

And you
You should come running now
Yeah you
Who'd refuse to speak at every letter
You know it's better to lose
You know the air will freeze before it gets better

Being
Being left with barbed wire and a shoe-string
We're just being
Being left with barbed wire and a shoe-string
We're just being
Being left with barbed wire and a shoe-string
We're just being
Just being
