Song:

[Verse:]
Hidden beneath the ground
Is the spring that's feed the creeks
Invisible as the wind
That you feels upon your cheeks

And every breeze that whisper
Remind us constantly
Sometimes what's real
Is something you can't see~

[Chorus:]
Believe in all that can be
A miracle start whenever your dream
Believe and sing from your heart, you'll see
Your song will hold the key~
