Song:

Scared shaking my teeth loose These walls are closing in on me
Come on
Dropped jaws as they watch us sink into the sand where they know we should be
It could be said
We've been here to many times
And this is what I am
But I'm still trying to change my past
I've left so many drowning... So many hearts left astray
You'll pray for me but I'll die for you?
Come on
This is what I am but I'm still living with your ghost
I only wish you the best
Still sinking my teeth marks
These walls are closing in on me
Don't talk as they watch us sink into the sand where they know it should be
Is this what you, had hoped for?
I'm sorry to say, that I want now to be free
Go on be with him
I'll die as no hero
And I'm the victim of betrayal
Can you see them now watching you?
Feeling everything
Well I'm sorry to say this is goodbye
I only hoped for the best
Don't talk as they watch us sinking
Your past is?
Into the sand where they know it should be
Say good bye!
Don't talk as they watch us sinking
