Song:

You loved it when my heart dropped, you paused, stopped, and walked away
Full of content that it went your way

These cuts that I've caused are never too deep to heal
Peel back the bandage, see a scar from countless careless things

And feel yourself drifting, pulled away

Well nothing feels real anymore
I'm not taking my time anymore
To show you how I feel
To show you who I am
Cause it's locked away

We all need to find our way
Cut the loss, just walk away, ooh

Now head towards the light, the dark has no place here
Now head towards the light, the dark has no place here

I don't feel real, I don't feel real
This pain is beating.
I don't feel real, I don't feel real

Well nothing feels real anymore
I'm not taking my time anymore

Now head towards the light, the dark has no place here
Now head towards the light, the dark has no place here

Well nothing feels real anymore
I'm not taking my time anymore
To show you how I feel
To show you who I am
Cause it's locked away

The things we think about at night never lose taste
Now, take the close to find something greater
This wall has finally reached it's end
It's higher ground, lets make a stand
Did you ever think that we would get this high?
Pull back the sheets to find the ending that you prayed for.

Now head towards the light, the dark has no place here
Now head towards the light
