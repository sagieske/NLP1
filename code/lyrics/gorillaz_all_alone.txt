Chorus

Alone...(Alone) (x16)

Leviticus-o...
Deuteronomy...

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like
Seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress?
Can't take this, really can't finish this
These ears and all these graces
It's my mistake, I make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce-wiggle bounce-wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats
Bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted cain
I'll twist again
I'll push the blade
As plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
We shoot where who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth ovah
Return of the ogah!

Chorus

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come on save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me

Chorus
