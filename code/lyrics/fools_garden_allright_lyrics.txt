Song:

(Hinkel / Freudenthaler)

Can you hear me?
Baby, wake up!
You're a little late,
It's nearly ten.
You look awful
Without the make-up
And if you don't stop
You will kiss the end
Allright, allright
Say did you ever think about it
Allright, allright

It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down
It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down

You're going down instead of going up
Say do you think that I am an elevator
I'm sick an tired of it
Baby stop!
You never do it
'cause you do it later
Allright, allright
Say did you ever think about it
Allright, allright

It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down
It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down

It makes no difference to me how you feel
You've got me waiting for so long
Don't mind, my direction's not your physical attraction
Bye, bye karma!

I'm sorry baby but you've got to face it now
I'm not the one
I think you will see
You always tell me that you'll mend your ways
I don't believe it anymore - it kills me
Allright, allright

It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down
It's allright
When your life gets you
Your life gets you down
