Written by ugly kid joe

I'm frank sinatra in a rock n roll band
I'm a hevayweight demon with a heavyweight plan
I'm uncle sam with a joint in my mouth
And my v8s floored when I headed down south
This aint hell, sure aint heaven
Pull on over to the seven eleven
Stop rich now, pontiac here
Big blue love budweiser beer
Can't you see them
Can't you see them
Gi joe I'm stretch armstrong
Every blade of grass I'm the water in the bong
I'm aqua man I'm the devil with a grin
Ambidextrous now cause I use both limbs
East palo alto, age 26
Full love circle not one love missed
A1 liquor, berones too
Crown royal, no. 502
Can't you see them
Can't you see them
August 27th on a calendar scale
And on this day I went to jail
The blue man on my trip and on my ride
See I gotta go and will I survive
I'm the man and I do and I don't
I'm the man and I will and I wont
I'm the man and I could not lie
Why most should live now some should die
