Song:

At Last......

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh ya ya

At Last......

The sky's above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clovers
The night I I looked at you
I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I I I I could call my own
I found a thrill
To press my cheek to
A thrill that I've never known

Oh ya ya

And you smiled
And you smiled

Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine......

At last
