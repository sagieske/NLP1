Song:

If you were mine, everytime,
You could be the one to make me feel alright,
Day or night, feel you close in my arms,
If you were mine, yes it's true,
There would never be a day without your smile,
Take your time,
Baby I would feel so real if you were mine.

Hold me close into your arms,
Never let me down girl.
Feel the magic in the air, it's here
Love is written on my face,
Everytime you're near me,
Just be here and it's alright.

Everynight and everyday,
Need your loving here to stay,
Not just today, but everyday on my way,
You gotta keep it in your mine,
That life will be so fine,
Oh baby if you would be mine.

If you were mine, everytime,
You could be the one to make me feel alright,
Day or night, feel you close in my arms,
If you were mine, yes it's true,
There would never be a day without your smile,
Take your time,
Baby I would feel so real if you were mine.

Since I know that times have changed,
Always light around me,
'cause you make my dreams come true so true.
Years before I felt so sad, now the hope is rising.
With your love, I'm gonna fly so high.

Feel the magic in the air, be aware
That if you share my dreams
It seems love is everywhere.
You gotta keep it in your mine
That love will make me shine,
Oh baby if you would be mine.

If you were mine, everytime,
You could be the one to make me feel alright,
Day or night, feel you close in my arms,
If you were mine, yes it's true,
There would never be a day without your smile,
Take your time,
Baby I would feel so real if you were mine.
