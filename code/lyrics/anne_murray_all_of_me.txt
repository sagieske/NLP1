Song:

All of me
Why not take all of me?
Can't you see
I'm no good without you?

Take my arms
I want to lose them
Take my lips
I'll never use them.

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?...
