Song:

[Verse:]
So tell me what are we living for?
I say we chuck inhibitions
And sell our souls to rock and roll
I need to know what I'm missing

So turn it up on the stereo
Somebody light the ignition
What the hell are you waiting for?
It's time to make a decision

(Nah-oooh)

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin

I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now

[Verse 2:]
If there's a maker up above
Then why is nobody listening
You show me hate, and I'll show you love
It's not about your religion

We're always lookin' to someone else
Just take a look in the mirror
'Cause all you need is inside yourself
It couldn't be any clearer

(Nah-oooh)

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin

I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now

[Bridge:]
The more we love,
The more we learn
The more we love,
The more we burn
The more we love

So tell me what are we livin' for
I say we chuck inhibitions
And sell our souls to rock n' roll
I need to know what I'm missin'

[Chorus:]
I'm feeling the world go round
It's spinning me upside down
I'm finally homeward bound
I'm not giving up
It's crawling under my skin
And I don't care if I sin

I really want it
I really want it
I really want it right now
I really want it right now
