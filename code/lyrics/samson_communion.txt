Song:

Muscles getting weaker
Outlook getting bleaker
Sun is setting in your eye
Winter's blown your hair grey
For many seasons now
As you speak your willpower is drained
Now we can start the long way home
Now we can start the long way home
Call upon the energy within you
Communion will come from all around
Magnify your tiny light
Spirit blessing in the night
Feel your power surge
Now we can start the long way home
Now we can start the long way home
Now we can start the long way home
Now we can start the long way home
Rest in peace tonight
If we find our way back there
Deaf and blind and weary;
Rest and sleep tonight
If we build a place of peace
So when we meet our last goodbye
Our final breath a contened sigh
Our children will be free
Rest in peace tonight
Find our way back there
Now we can start the long way home
Find our way back there
Now we can start the long way home
Find our way back there
