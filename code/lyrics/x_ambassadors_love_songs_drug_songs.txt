Song:

Alright
Stay over
Stinking like Jackie-D and coca-cola
Hey now
Don't try to f**k with me
Ill throw you underneath the bus if you understand me
Love songs
Drug songs
We can get together if you get to know me
Play nice
Baby think twice

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together (2x)

Play dead
Roll over
Stinking like s** in a range rover
Bail out
Baby you asked for it
Pray that someone in the car got the cash for it
Love songs
Are drug songs
We can get together if you understand me
Blink twice
Baby think twice

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together (2x)

Grown man
Tipping over
Stinking like a badge and a filled quota
Hard time
Break you out again
Break you out
Break you out again
Break you out

And I look you in the eye
You know this is the last time I'm
Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together (2x)

Gonna put you back together
Gonna put you back together (2x)
