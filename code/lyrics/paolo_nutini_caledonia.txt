Song:

I don't know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
And these past few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away
I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where I come from
And that's the reason why I seem
So far away today

Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you; re calling me
Now I'm going home
And if I shall become a stranger
No it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

Well I have moved
And I've kept on moving
Proved the points
That I needed proving
I've lost the friends
That I needed losing
Found others on the way
I have kissed the fellas
And left them sighing
Stolen dreams yes there's no denying
I have travelled hard
Sometimes with conscience flying
Somewhere with the wind

Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you; re calling me
Now I'm going home
And if I shall become a stranger
No it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

Now I'm sitting here
Before the fire
The empty room
A forest choir
The flames have cooled
Don't get any higher
They've withered now
They're gone
And I'm steady thinking
My way is clear
And I know what
I will do tomorrow
The hands have shaken
The kisses flowed
And I will dissappear

Let me tell you that I love you
That I think about you all the time
Caledonia you; re calling me
Now I'm going home
And if I shall become a stranger
No it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
