Song:

Once two individuals walked in a room
One looked at the other
But he doesn't know what to do
He'd better figure out his plan so
If he succeeds, he'll get what he needs
So he builds up the nerve to go
And talk to the girl
That he's been burning for
And he says, with a slightly boyish grin
I know that this sounds weird,
But you've just got to hear
I've got this fantasy,
Just between you and me
Where we could spend the
Night and all of the day
Doing all the things I just can't say
And in my fantasy, your kiss is heavenly
So I try to figure out any possible way
To make my fantasy come true one day
She politely denies his invitation
Just then another one hits the floor
One down and one to go
This time he must be smooth,
Or he'll be pulling root
So he says please
Can I just buy you a drink
And I'll show you
That I'll do anything for one kiss
But before let me tell you this
