Song:

She's a good girl, she's Daddy's favorite
Saves up for Harvard, she knows she'll make it
She's good at school, she's never truant
She can speak French, and I think she's fluent

[Calum:]
Every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
She sneaks out the window to be with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em... 

[All (Chorus):]
She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

[Luke:]
(Do, do do, do do, do do)

[Calum:]
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught...
[Luke:]
(Do, do do, do do, do do)

[Calum:]
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught... 

She's a good girl
Straight A student
She's well into her self-improvement
I swear she lives in the library
But if you ask her she'll say, 

[Michael:]
"That's where you'll find me!"

[Luke:]
But if you're looking, you won't find her there
She may be better but she just loves to swear... 
In the back of the room, where nobody looks, 
She'll be with her boyfriend... she's not reading books

[All (Chorus):]
She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

[Luke:]
(Do, do do, do do, do do)

[Calum:]
Good girls are bad girls and good girls are bad girls! 

[Luke:]
(Do, do do, do do, do do)

[Calum:]
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught! 

[Ashton:]
She's a good girl, hasn't been caught... 
She's a good girl, hasn't been caught... 

[All (Chorus):]
She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

[Luke:]
She said to me, forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
