Song:

When I was alone,
I felt so cold,
Its hard to keep from shaking.
I found someone and I couldn't move.
I couldn't breathe.
And you try to tell me
That were almost here.
That weve almost made it.
How can I be somebody new,
When I see my own reflection?
And you try to tell me
That weve almost made it.
That were almost here.
How can I be somebody new,
When I see my own reflection?
