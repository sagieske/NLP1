"Aqua Boogie
(A Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop)"
{G Clinton, W Collins, B Worrell}
Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!
I am Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk
I can't swim
I never could swim
I never will swim
Oh, put me down!
Let go my leg! (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!)
I told ya...will you shut up!...I told ya I can't swim! Ha hOwww no!

Put me down, I hate water, ho

(Hah -ah hah -ah hah -ahhh)

Will you shut up!

(Aqua boogie baby) Never learned to swim,
(underwater boogie baby)
Can't catch the rhythm of the stroke
(Aqua boogie baby) Why should I hold my breath,
(underwater boogie baby)
Feelin' that I might choke (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!)

(Aqua boogie baby)
Things ya blow through, because of things ya swim through
(Underwater boogie baby)
Why hold your nose to spite your face (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!)
(Aqua boogie baby)
With the rhythm that makes you dance to what we have to live through
(Underwater boogie baby)
You can dance underwater and not get wet, OH!!!

Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadooloop
(Put me down, let go my leg OH!)
Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadooloop
Psychoalphadiscobetabiohumanyouloop

I hate water, let me go, put me down! Hah-ho
You're all wet!

(I'm at the boogie baby) Never mean to drown
(I'm Underwater boogie baby) Can't comprehend all the strokes
(I'm at the boogie baby) Why should I hold my breath?
(Underwater boogie baby) (he's deep) Feelin' that I might choke! Oh!

(Aquaboogie baby) There's a magic rhythm one with the a real drum (?)
(Underwater boogie baby) Why blow your nose to spite your face
(Aquaboogie baby)
With the rhythm it takes to dance to what we have to live through
(Underwater boogie baby) You can dance underwater and not get wet.

I am the Nose (Ha-ah, hah-ah, ha-ah)

(Ha-ah, ha-ah, ha-ah!)
