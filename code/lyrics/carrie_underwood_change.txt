Song:

Whatcha gonna do with the 36 cents
Sticky with Coke on your floorboard
When a woman on the street is huddled in the cold
On a sidewalk vent trying to keep warm

Do you call her over, hand her the change
Ask her story, ask her her name
Or do you tell yourself

You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world

Oh, whatcha gonna do when you're watching tv
And an ad comes on, yeah you know the kind
Flashing up pictures of a child in need
For a dime a day you could save a life

Do you call the number, reach out a hand
Or do you change the channel, call it a scam
Or do you tell yourself

You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world

Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world

The world's so big it can break your heart
And you just want to help not sure where to start
So you close your eyes, and send up a prayer into the dark

You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
Don't listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world

Oh, the smallest thing can make all the difference
Love is alive, don't you listen to 'em when they say
You're just a fool
Just a fool to believe you can change the world
