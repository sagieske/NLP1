Song:

Gravity pulls and we fall from the clouds
We prove to each other
That we're both human now
The time that we spent
Trying to make sense of it all

All that I'm asking for
Is that you need nothing more
And nothing comes in between
Our love and it's fragile scene
All that I'm asking for
You're all that I'm asking for

Now we walk together
Knowing where we've been
Knowing the stakes of being mistaken again
It's in the past tense
There is no making sense of it now

All that I'm asking for
Is that you need nothing more
And nothing comes in between
Our love and it's fragile scene
All that I'm asking for
You're all that I'm asking for

In the still of your hands
Anything can happen now
With every beat of my heart
Love speaks in silence

In the still of your hands
Anything is possible
With every beat of my heart

The time that we spent
Trying to make sense
Of it all

All that I'm asking for
Is that you need nothing more
And nothing comes in between
Our love and it's fragile scene
All that I'm asking for

Is that you need nothing more
And nothing comes in between
Our love and it's fragile scene
All that I'm asking for
You're all that I'm asking for

It's in the past tense,
There's no making sense of it now
