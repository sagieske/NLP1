Song:

1) Move, and you will find
Your blood flows, as thick as mine
Its so sad, the way we do the things we do
Makes me mad, knowin the things I done to you


2) Time and temptation, can really run you down
And all these frustrations, pushing me underground
So if I mind my heart in your presence, will I be free
And if I do the things you say, will you take all of me


Chorus -
It drives me crazy cause you've got too much to ignore
And I can't see myself on the outside looking in
We've all got troubles yes I know
But if we struggle we can grow
Find myself in your eyes standing in the glow


3) Standing in your shadow, or lying in the shade of your arms
Masking my expression, another way to not be harmed
Yesterday is fallen, todays on another line
Your running in circles, and I am out of time


Chorus
