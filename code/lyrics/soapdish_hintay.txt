Song:

Nakakulong sa bahay
Namumuti na'ng kulay ko
Nakaupo't naghihintay
Pa rin sa tawag mo

Usapan 7: 30
My God it's 12 already.
And I'm Stil waiting for your
Stupid call

[Chorus:]
Just what the hell happened to you
Are You Dead
Maybe you lost your Love instead
I'll take a picture of my
Heart it's dead
Not just because I really like you
Honey you can fool around me
Hey you honey
'Coz I won't push you down
No more
Not true maybe
You made me go round and round
Uh oh.
Around yeah eh yeah yeah

Pag beerhouse di na bale
Baka 'no pa'ng ma-dale ko
Magtitiis na lang sa
Picture mong ninakaw ko

A simple sweet temptation
Totally lead to bad vibration
Pero nag-iisa na
'San ka ba?

[Chorus 2:]
Just what the hell happened to you
Are You Dead
Maybe you found someone instead
I'll take a picture of my
Heart it's dead
Not just because I really like you
Honey you can fool around me
Hey you honey
'Coz I won't push you down
No more
Not true maybe
You made me go round and round
Uh oh.
Around yeah eh yeah yeah
