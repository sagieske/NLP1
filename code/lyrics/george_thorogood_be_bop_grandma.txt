Song:

Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma do the rock 'n' roll
Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma do the rock 'n' roll

She can rock day and night
Bless her soul

Well, she's a be bop grandma
Who thinks she's a sweet sixteen
She can dance so good
She can keep up with Maybelline

I didn't know my sweet grandma
Was a rock 'n' roll queen

She's a fan of Bandstand
She watches each and every day
She can shimmy and dance
To any record any jockey can play

She's a hip shakin' grandma
Hip, hip, hip hooray

Well, shake it one time for me, grams
Shake it, please don't break it
Shake it one time for me girl
Shake it, please don't break it

I said shake it one time
Shake it one time for me
Yeah

Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma do the rock 'n' roll
Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma do the rock 'n' roll

And as long as she can rock
She will never get old

Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma watchin' mtv
Peepin' through the window
Watchin' grandma watchin' mtv

Everybody thinks she's crazy
But she's alright with me

She's alright with me
She's alright with me
She's alright with me
