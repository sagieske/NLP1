Song:

Anastasia
Tell me who you are
Are you someone
From another star

Anastasia
Are you what you seem
Do your sad eyes
Remember a dream

Why do you tremble
And why do you sigh
Could you be lonely
As lonely as I

Will you remember
When summer has flown
Another world, a world
That is yours alone

Anastasia
Smile away the past
Anastasia
Spring is here at last

Beautiful stranger
Step down from your star
I only know I love you so
Whoever you are

Anastasia, Anastasia

Beautiful stranger
Step down from your star
I only know I love you so
Whoever you are
