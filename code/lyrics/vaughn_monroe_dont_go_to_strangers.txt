Don't Go To Strangers
Vaughn Monroe

Mucic by Arthur Kentand Dave Mann Lyrics by Redd Evans

Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love,
Don't go to strangers darling, come to me.
Play with fire till your fingers burn,
And when there's no place for you to turn,
Don't go to strangers darling, come to me.
For, when you hear a call to follow your heart,
You'll follow your heart I know.
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand,
And I'll understand if you go! So,
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers darling, come to me.
