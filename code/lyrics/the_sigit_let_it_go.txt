Song:

His mouth's whole lot of dirty words
The church sings out of mighty chords
Rather speak none clue
Than make a world a zoo

He drank whole lot of lot of booze
Nerve strips on the marbles blues
In a poor old Reagan views
I'm fighting while I'm confused

Just say no
Let it go
Say no just let it go

He lost whole lot of honesty
Mosque spread new prophecy
In a poor old Reagan views
I'm fighting while I'm confused

He drank whole lot of lot of booze
Nerve strips on the marbles blues
In a poor old Reagan views
I'm fighting while I'm confused
