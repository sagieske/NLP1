Song:

Some things you feel
Before somethings revealed
Sometimes you know
Before sometimes it shows
You were with her said you werent and you're
Not not not
Gonna lie about the feelings that you
Got got got
You can tell me that you love me but you're
Not not not
Gonaa get away with lying coz you're
Hot hot hot
I believed you when you talked about
Love love love
That im the only on that you were thinkin of
But im really not the type to rise above
A little indiscretion with a scrub
Busted , it's you i trusted
I guess i must have been a fool
Some things you feel
Before somethings revealed
Sometimes you know
Before sometimes it shows
Its not gonna happen you can
Try try try
Id never take you back I'd rather
Die die die
I know you really did it coz you
Lie lie lie
And now were not N'sync so it's
Bye bye bye
So you tell me that you want me and im hot
(uh huh)
And im the only good thing that you got
(uh uh)
Too bad you were cheating and got caught
You really don't deserve another shot
Busted , it's you i trusted
I guess i must have been a fool
You were with her said you werent
Had you're fun fun fun
Now i guess you're gonna pay for all the things youve done
Don't even try to tell me she's the only one
If you see me comming near
You better run run run
So now i know the truth i wonder
Why why why
But im really not the type to sit around and
Cry cry cry
Now you turned you're back on the one you trusted
Too bad baby coz you're busted
