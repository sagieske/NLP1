Song:

So you think you'll take another piece of me
To satisfy your intellectual need
Do you want? Do you want action?

Gonna bring you down 'cos you're pushin' me
You gotta recognize my superiority

Liar, liar - you know you believed it
Liar, liar - 'cos I'm the main man
And that's why

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
And everybody wants a piece of the action

Oh I was suicidal 'cos she was my idol
Baby baby baby bring it to my knees
Now there was a time I would have walked the line
Don't you drag me down with your insatiable greed

Liar, liar - you know you believed it
Liar, liar - 'cos I'm the main man
And that's why

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
And everybody wants a piece of the
Action!

Do you want?
Action, action!

Everybody wants, everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody needs

Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody needs a main attraction
I got what everybody needs
Satisfaction guaranteed
And everybody wants a piece of the
Action, action, action ...
