Song:

Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on you
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on you
I wanna love you so bad
Til I don't know what to do

I'm going down to Louisiana
To get me a mojo hand
I'm going down to Louisiana
To get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna have all you women
Right under my command

Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working)
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on you

I got a gypsy woman
Givin' me advice

I got a gypsy woman
Givin' me advice
I got a whole lotta tricks
I'm keepin them on ice

Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working)
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on you

Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working)
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
(Got my mojo working)
Got my mojo working
But it just don't work on you
