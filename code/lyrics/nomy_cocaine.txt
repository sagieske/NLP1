Song:

You are in pain
Take your life, take your life with cocaine
But I am who I am
So I do what I can, when I can
But I can't really do a damn thing

So fine this day
All your problems has gone away
But tomorrow, when you wake up
All your problems are back to stay

Your life, a game
Turn it up, turn it up with cocaine
And everytime that you live is a time when you feel
And the only time you heal

Tell me what it is
And it would never be like this
A problem that we have in common
Baby tell me what it is
It probably doesn't mean a piss
Yeah rip my heart apart

Now it's too late, too late to live
Only heaven loves you now
So love it back for once
Just once

Now it's too late, too late to live
And my conscience killing me
So am I alive
But I'm not free

And for all of you that can relate to this too
And for all of you that can relate to this too

White snow
I know
You're on a place where I just can't go
But I hope you do remember
Your snow doesn't warm you in december

You are in pain
Take your life, take your life with cocaine
But I am who I am
So I do what I can, when I can
But I can't really do a damn thing

Now it's too late, too late to live
Only heaven loves you now
So love it back for once
Just once

Now it's too late, too late to live
And my conscience killing me
So am I alive
But I'm not free

And for all of you that can relate to this too
And for all of you that can relate to this too

Tell me what it is
And it would never be like this
A problem that we have in common
Baby tell me what it is
It probably doesn't mean a piss
Yeah rip my heart apart

You are in pain
Take your life, take your life with cocaine
But I am who I am
So I do what I can, when I can
But I can't really do a damn thing

Now it's too late, too late to live
Only heaven loves you now
So love it back for once
Just once

Now it's too late, too late to live
And my conscience killing me
So am I alive
But I'm not free

And for all of you that can relate to this too
And for all of you that can relate to this too

Now it's too late(x13)
