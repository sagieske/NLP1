Song:

You see the kid who just tags along
To young to know what was going on
Wouldn't give me the time & day
Well little sister grew up and hey don't you see
I think you need for you to take me seriously

Coz you seriously got a lot of
Things to say don't you see
How it could be

Chorus:
I could be the girl who most likely to
Blow you away with what I can do
Maybe I'm a superstar maybe I'll double cross in my head

I could be the girl who most likely to
Make every dream I'm dreaming come true
What you see is what you get
I haven't even happened yet, haven't even happened yet

Who knows someday I could be frontpage news
Everybody's wishin they're in my shoes
And I'll bet you'll never guess
And all the time inside the backseat instead
Telling all the world what was in my head
And I definitely got a lot of

Things to do don't you know, how I could go...

Chorus:
I could be the girl who most likely to
Blow you away with what I can do
Maybe I'm a superstar maybe I'll double cross in my head

I could be the girl who most likely to
Make every dream I'm dreaming come true
What you see is what you get
I haven't even happened yet, haven't even happened yet

Oh... Oh...
It could go either way
Oh... Oh...
I could be the one to say
I told you so... Eh...

(I could be the girl who most likely to
Blow you away with what I can do
Maybe I'm a superstar maybe I'll double cross in my head

I could be the girl who most likely to
Make every dream I'm dreaming come true
What you see is what you get
I haven't even happened yet, haven't even happened yet)
