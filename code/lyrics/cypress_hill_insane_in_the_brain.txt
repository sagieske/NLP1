Song:

Who you tryin' to get crazy with ese? Don't you know I'm loco?

To da one on da flamboyant tempa
I just toss that ham on the fryin pan
Like spam
It's done when I come in slam
Damn, I feel like the son of sam
Don't make me wrek s**t
Hectic next to the chair
Got me goin' like general electric
Errr
The lights are blinkin' I'm thinkin'
It's all over when go out drinkin'
Oh makin' my mind slow,
That's why I don't f**k with the big four-oh
Bro, I got ta' maintain
Cuz a n***a like me is goin' insane

Chorus:
Insane in da membrane
Insane in da brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Fred's insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Do my s**t undercover
Now it's time for for the blubba
Blaba to watch dat belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet don't try it
I'll jack your a** like a looter in a riot
My s***s fat like a sumo slammin' dat a**
Leavin' your face in the grass
You know I don't take a dulo lightly
Punk just jealous cuz he can't outwrite me
So kick that style, wicked wild
Happy face n***a never seen me smile
Rip dat mainframe
I'll explain
A n***a like me is goin' insane

Chorus

Like Louie Armstrong
Played the trumpet
I'll hit dat bong and break ya off something soon
I got ta get my props
Cops
Come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad
Yes I'm the pirate pilot
Of this ship if I get
Wit' the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen
Look, but don't make your eyes strain
A n***a like me is goin' insane

Chorus
