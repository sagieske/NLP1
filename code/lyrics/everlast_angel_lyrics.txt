Song:

Imma find me
A woman that's real
Imma find me
A woman that's strong
Imma find me
A woman that's oh so true
I got a pedestal to put her on

I found me a Girl
She's sweet as could be
An everythin' in her world
Revolved all around me

I had a chance to make her mine
But I was to blind to see
And now I got to let her go
An pray she comes back to me

-She's my angel she's my lover
-She's my very best friend
-I hate her cause I love her
-So I hurt her again
-Don't want no other lover
-Won't go through it again
-She's my Angel She's my lover
-She's my very best friend

Imma find me
A woman that's young
Imma find me
A woman that's pretty
Imma find me
A woman that swears I'm the one
An imma try not to treat her shitty

Girl I been drinkin
Ever since you been gone
An I been thinkin
Maybe that I was wrong
You been holdin' out for way to long
I get this feeling you don't wanna belong

-She's my Angel, She's my Lover
-She's my very best friend
-I hate her cause I love her
-So I hurt her again
-Don't want no other lover
-Won't go through it again
-She's my Angel She's my lover
-She's my very best friend

Imma find me
A woman that's tough
Imma find me
A woman that's loyal
Imma find me
A woman that say she got enough
And that's the one I'm gonna spoil

Well I've been waitin
Such a very long time
My hearts gonna break
Girl if I don't make you mine

What's past is past
What's done I cannot rewind
All said and done girl
So your one of a kind

-She's my Angel, She's my Lover
-She's my very best friend
-I hate her cause I love her
-So I hurt her again
-Don't want no other lover
-Won't go through it again
-She's my Angel She's my lover
-She's my very best friend

-She's my Angel, She's my Lover
-She's my very best friend
-I hate her cause I love her
-So I hurt her again
-Don't want no other lover
-Won't go through it again
-She's my Angel She's my lover
-She's my very best friend
