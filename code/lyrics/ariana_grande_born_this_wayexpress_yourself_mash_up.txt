Song:

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothin wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far,
Listen to me when I say"

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

Ooo there ain't no other way
Baby I was born this way
Baby I was born this way

So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
(Make him express yourself)
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Born-born-bo-bo-born this way
Ooooh-ooooh
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
(Baby I was born this way hey heeey)
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
(Respect yourself)
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

I was born this way hey
(Don't go for second best baby)
I was born this way hey
I'm on the right track baby I was born this way hey
Hey, I was born this way hey
Express yourself
Hey hey hey hey...
