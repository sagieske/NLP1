Song:

Aby Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swim so wild and you swim so free
Heaven above and sea below
You're a little white whale on the go.
Baby Beluga.
Ah, Baby Beluga.
Is the water warm, is your mother home
With you so happy?
Way down yonder where the dolphins play
Where you dive and splash all day.
Waves roll in and the wave roll out.
See the water squirting out of your spout.
Baby Beluga.
Ah, Baby Beluga.
Sing your little song, sing for all your friends.
We'd like to hear you.

Anthony: Let's do a whale dance, everybody. Flip your tails up. Waves roll in, waves roll out. Now take some big breaths. That's it.

Greg: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo.
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo.
When it's dark and you're home and fed
Curled out snug in your water bed.
Moon is shining and the stars are out.
Good night, little whale, good night.
Baby Beluga.
Ah, Baby Beluga.
With tomorrow's sun, another day's begun
You'll soon be waking.
Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swim so wild and you swim so free
Heaven above and sea below
You're a little white whale on the go.
You're just a little white whale on the go.
You're just a little white whale on the go.
