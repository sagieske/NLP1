Song:

I'm up 24 hours, money and the power
Stuntin on the hoes and I; m shittin on the cowards
I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours (x2)
No s**t, shave or shower, until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up, I'm up 24 hours
Damn, it's a good day (x2)
Call Drummer Boy and told let's go make a hood tape,
First thing imma do, pull otu my 7'4,
Candy Coated Black thang sittin on them 40 O's,
24 tower, 8 bricks of powder, 10 bells of dro,
When I payed for the flour,
Don't talk about my lambo, talk about my Rarri,
Talk about my Phantom, or talk about my Harlie,
Bricksquad Bikerboys Angel name Charlie, goons goin physco, white boy narley every 24 auh second passing me da marley, lame tryna diss don't effect me hardly
Chorus:
I'm up 24 hours money and the power,
Stuntin on the hoes and I'm shittin on the cowards,
I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours (x2)
No s**t, shave or shower, until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up, I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours
I'm going to the bank again makin auh deposit,
It's getting kinda chilly, bring my minks up out da closet,
Getting kinda warm bring my jewrly out da safe,
If it be a problem put da hater in his place!
Slicker than an oil spill, sharper than an razor,
I'm screaming anybody get it like my n***a Major!
Finna copp auh condo an finna pull auh ammo,
Bricksquad bandana on think I'm fuckin Rambo,
It's Gucci!
Imma killa, so don't push me,
Bricksquad ain't o p***y n****s runnin wit dem wig splitters,
N****s screaming roll one Gucci let me hold some but I can't let cha hold nun I hit cha wit da whole drum,
Chorus:
I'm up 24 hours money and the power,
Stuntin on the hoes and I'm shittin on the cowards,
I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours (x2)
No s**t, shave or shower, until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up, I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours

I'm f*****g with the white girl you can call me Ice-T,
Cause I got my Crystal Zone you can call it Spike Lee,
Robbing me unlikely last tyr dropped dem hollaing tip stop dem I ain't have time to box him,
Stuntin like auh actor, winning like an athlete,
Straight to the money like a sprinter at auh track meet,
First sign Waka, then I sign Gucci, then I sign Bricksquad tell em comin sue me
Chorus:
I'm up 24 hours money and the power,
Stuntin on the hoes and I'm shittin on the cowards,
I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours (x2)
No s**t, shave or shower, until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up, I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours

Chorus:
I'm up 24 hours money and the power,
Stuntin on the hoes and I'm shittin on the cowards,
I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours (x2)
No s**t, shave or shower, until I get my money back, I gotta get my money up, I'm 24 hours
I'm up 24 hours
