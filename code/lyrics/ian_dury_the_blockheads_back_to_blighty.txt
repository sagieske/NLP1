Song:

When faced with a hinderance
The brave mountainier
Turns and walks back into the wind
But my hesitation
In strange hemisphere
Makes me quit before I begin

Intrepid explorer
His reason extremes
Persues the unknwo we perefect aplone
Behaves like a trooper
Who brags and blasphemes
Tell the truth, I wanna go home

Back to blighty
Back to blighty
Back to blighty
Back to blighty

The poor navagator
The siren that calls
He's not a warning of coming distressed
Although you're a chamer
The prospect appals
Going back to my former address

Back to blighty
Back to blighty
Back to blighty
Back to blighty

There is a green hill far away....
