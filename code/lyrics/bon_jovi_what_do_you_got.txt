Song:

Everybody wants something, just a little more
We're making a living, and what we're living for
A rich man or a poor man, a pawn or a king
You can live on the street, you can rule the whole world
But it don't mean one dang thing

What do you got, if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere
You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold, in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of

If you ain't got someone, you're afraid to lose
Everybody needs just one, someone... To tell them the truth
Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I still believe
I believe in hope, I believe the change can get us up off our knees

What do you got, if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere
You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold, in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of

If you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score
If you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for

I don't wanna have to talk about it,
How many songs you gotta sing about it?
How long you gonna live without it?
Why does someone somewhere have to doubt it?
Someday we'll figure it out

Solo

What do you got, if you ain't got love?
Whatever you got, it just ain't enough
You walk in the road, but you're going nowhere
You're tryin' to find your way home, but there's no one there
Who do you hold, in the dark of night?
You wanna give up, but it's worth the fight
You have all the things, that you've been dreaming of

If you ain't got love, it's all just keeping score
If you ain't got love, what the hell we doing it for
Woahhh, I ain't got, if you ain't got love
Woahhh, What do you got if you ain't got love?
Woahhh, What do you got if you ain't got love?
