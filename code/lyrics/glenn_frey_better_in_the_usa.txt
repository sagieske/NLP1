Song:

Well they look to the east
They look to the west
The Third World wonders
Which way's the best
We got freedom, we got soul
We got blue jeans and rock'n roll

Man, there ain't no choice
It's better in the U.S.A.
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
You can be what you want
Say what you wanna say
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
Why can't I make you understand
It's better in the U.S.A.
(It's better in the U.S.A.)

I hear the same propaganda
Day after day
It's gettin' so hip to knock the U.S.A.
If we're so awful and we're so bad
You oughta check the night life
In Leningrad

Man, it ain't even close
It's better in the U.S.A.
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
If you could see behind the curtain
Life is cold and grey
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
How can I make you understand
It's better in the U.S.A.
(It's better, it's better)
I think I'll play

Nobody's perfect and change comes slow
It's really up to you
Which way you wanna go
You can lean to the left
And lean to the right
You can stand in the dark
You can stand in the light

Drivin' on the beach
On a night in June
Me and my baby
In the lover's moon
They're playin' sweet soul music

Got it turned up loud
Make me feel so good
Make me feel so proud

Man, there ain't no choice
It's better in the U.S.A.
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
Well they'd be movin' here from Moscow
If they could only find a way
(It's better in the U.S.A.)
How can I make you understand
It's better in the U.S.A., baby baby
(It's better)

We got the burgers and fries
(In the U.S.A.)
We got the friendly skies
(In the U.S.A.)
We got the beautiful girls
(In the U.S.A.)
Got the beautiful curls
(In the U.S.A.)
We're drivin' beautiful cars
(In the U.S.A.)
We're diggin' movie stars
(In the U.S.A.)
We get to make romance
(In the U.S.A.)
Let the little girl dance
(In the U.S.A.)
It's better, baby
Nice sweater, baby
What do you say you and me go for a little drive.
Come on.

It's better (Repeat and fade)
