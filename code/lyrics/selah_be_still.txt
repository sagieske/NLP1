Song:

Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here; 
Come bow before him now with reverence and fear
In him no sin is found we stand on holy ground.
Be still, for the presence of the Lord, the holy One, is here.

Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around; 
He burns with holy fire, with splendour he is crowned:
How awesome is the sight our radiant king of light! 
Be still, for the glory of the Lord is shining all around.

Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place:
He comes to cleanse and heal, to minister his grace - no work too hard for
Him.
In faith receive from him.
Be still, for the power of the Lord is moving in this place.
