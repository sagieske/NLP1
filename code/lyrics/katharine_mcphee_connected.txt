Song:

I'm blind-folded on
This carriage ride that they call life.
Keep trying to make it
Through that next turn,
Knuckles white and holdin' tight.
So here I go, takin' a curve,
But I know that I'm never alone.
I think of you,
I know you'd never let me go.

I feel connected, protected,
It's like you're sitting right with me
All the time.
You hear me, you're near me,
And everything else is gonna be alright.
'Cause nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this time.
Connected... Connected inside.

It's not an accident,
The time we spent apart.
But now we're so close,
I can always find you
Right here in my heart.
You've given me somethin' I need,
And I don't ever want it to end.
Because of you,
I know I've found my strength again.

I feel connected, protected,
It's like you're sitting right with me
All the time.
You hear me, you're near me,
And everything else's gonna be alright.
'Cause nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this time.
Connected... Connected inside.

Every time that I breathe,
I can feel the energy.
Reachin' out, flowin' through,
You to me and me to you.
Wake or dream, walk or stand,
You are everywhere I am.
Separate souls, unified
Touching at the speed of light.

Whoa, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh,
Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh

I feel connected, protected,
It's like
You're sitting right with me
All the time.
You hear me, you're near me,
And everything else's gonna be alright.
Connected, protected,
Now you're in my mind,
Now I'm doin' fine.
You hear me, you're near me,
And everything else's gonna be alright.
'Cause nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this,
Nothin' can break this time.
Connected... Connected inside
