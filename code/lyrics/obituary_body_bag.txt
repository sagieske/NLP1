Song:

You're rising
Cure you of the dead
You're dying
Live beyond the way
Falling thru the gates
Scavenge you
With the darkening light
Thru the falling going low
Thru the death of those
The dying...
We're dying
Healing of the one
Falling of the days
Charring in the sun
We're dying
Killing for the need
Violence of the ways
Slowly bleed
Killing for the need
Rising of the dead
The falling ways
The killing for the need
.. Darkened light
The rising of the dead
With the darkening light
