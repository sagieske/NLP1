Song:

Blind and ambiguous, all part of the game
I've feigned my ambivalence with a smile

All my hate beneath me forms a cage
All this time to form the man I became

The sun in my hand becomes my despair
For I still want the truth

Play the fool so ignorant in the shadow of disdain
Breeding your deception without eyes

All my hate beneath me forms a cage
All this time to form the man I became

The sun in my hand becomes my despair
For I still want the truth

Play the fool so ignorant, deception is the game
Bleeding hearts and soiled minds
Reflect the state of our being

All my hate beneath me forms a cage
All this time to form the man I became

The sun in my hand becomes my despair
The sun in my hand becomes my despair

Play the fool so ignorant, deception is the game
Bleeding hearts and soiled minds
Reflect the state of our being
