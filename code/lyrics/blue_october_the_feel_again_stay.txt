Song:

I see the sun go down on the river
I feel the wind blow out, would've stayed to gray
I feel the air around you, it's kinda closing in
Do you feel it fall, or do you feel at all, I can!

I see the world keep moving as I stumble
They seem to move much faster than me
And while I sit in my four cornered room dividing hearts for a little girl
Well I can't be anything but who I am

And I wish you'd stay
That was the beginning of the two of us, the start of our show
Stay, stay, stay...
Now I would never have let go

And I see the sun go up as your image
And I feel the weight of your eyes as you stare
I feel it all when you, when you first, when you kissed my lips
You used to make me feel at home, you made me feel at home, you made me
Feel again

Oh and that's when you use to say, "Will you stay, and not let go?"
That was just the two of us to think about, the stars of our show
And you would say, "I wish you'd stay and I'd never go"
Oh I would never have let go!

So take this heart of mine
You've taken it a hundred thousand times
But this time, this time, I'm gonna take it with me

I see the door close down behind you
I watch your face turn from glow to straight gray
I see the moon go up and it shines this glory on my face
Who would know? Who would know? Who would know?

How we would stay, and we should stay and never let go, oh hell no
There's just three of us to think about now, in our show, our show, our
Show
I think we'd stay, we'd just stay, and then we'd know
That we should never let go

Something to think about, her heart
Just look into those big brown eyes, and you'd just fall apart
We should stay, at least we'd stay, at least she'd know
That we should never let go
No, no, let go, go, oh...

I wish you'd stay
I wish you'd stay...
