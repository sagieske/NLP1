Song:

You will suffer enough in your years
And I don't want to bring you more pain
The skies turn light and dark and dark and light again
But you're the only sky I see
Will you be with me when the storm the rolls by?
Will you still need me when you're doing fine?
Will you still love me?
I have given my whole heart once before
And you know how that's a thrill
See I have loved and lost and lost and loved again still
You're the only love I need
Will you be with me when the storm rolls by?
Will you still need me when you're doing fine?
Will you still love me?
