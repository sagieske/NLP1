Song:

Because he called the forest brother
Because he called the earth his mother
They drove him out into the rain
And some people even said
That the boy from the country was insane

Because he spoke with fish in the creek
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak
And who knows, maybe they do
Hey, how do you know they don't
Just because they've never spoken to you

Boy from the country
Left his home when he was young
Boy from the country
He loves the sun

He tried to tell us that we should love the land
We just turned our heads and laughed
You see we did not understand

But you know sometimes I think
The boy from the country
Must be the only one who sees
Because the boy from the country
Doesn't want to see the forest
He'd rather see the trees

Boy from the country
Left his home when he was young
Boy from the country
He loves the sun
