Song:

Hey, Mister Bartender
Please don't be so slow
I got time for one more round
And a six pack to go

Tomorrow mornin's Sunday
I'm gonna be feelin' low
So please, please, bartender
I wanna six pack to go

I've been drinkin' all day long
Takin' in the town
I've done spent my whole paycheck
Justa honky tonkin' 'round

I don't have enough to pay my rent
I ain't gonna worry though
I've got time for one more round
And a six pack to go

Hey, Mister Bartender
Please don't be so slow
I got time for one more round
And a six pack to go

Tomorrow mornin's Sunday
I'm gonna be feelin' low
So please, please, bartender
I wanna six pack to go

I've been drinkin' all day long
Takin' in the town
I've done spent my whole paycheck
Justa honky tonkin' 'round

Well, I don't have enough to pay my rent
I ain't gonna worry though
I've got time for one more round
And a six pack to go

One six pack to go
