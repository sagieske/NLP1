Song:

The snow is falling, the city is white
Your eyes are shining like diamonds tonight
And we're all alone, there's no one home
You're finally in my arms again
The night is silent and Christmas is here
I couldn't ask for more than having you near
'Cause I love you, girl, I always will
And now I know the moment is right
The moment is right

I've been waiting to give this gift tonight
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time
It's something to last for as long as you live
Tonight I'm gonna give you (oh, girl) all my heart can give

I thought I'd give you something shiny and new
I tried to find something worthy of you
But I realized when I looked inside
There's some things that money can't buy (oh, no)
I feel the magic whenever you're near
I feel it even more this time of the year
'Cause I love you, girl, I always will
And now I know the moment is right
The moment is right

I've been waiting to give this gift tonight
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time
It's something to last for as long as you live
Tonight I'm gonna give you (oh, girl) all my heart can give

You know I'll always be true to you
And you know I'm the one you can turn to
Any time, any place, or anywhere
You know that I'll always be there

I've been waiting to give this gift tonight
I'm down on my knees, there's no better time
It's something to last for as long as you live
Tonight I'm gonna give you (oh, girl) all my heart can give
