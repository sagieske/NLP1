Song:

Slumber-blind I speak my mind
When I'm out cold (or so I'm told)
And so I'm scared to rest my head in company.
You're not scared of words unsaid,
You close your eyes, say your goodbyes
And so I'm left to watch you drift away from me
So peacefully.

And I'm just looking for the person
Who will smile at all my questions,
Who will tell me I'm just tired, and then send me
Back to sleep.

You stole the covers in the night,
You turned away, turned out the light,
But it's ok because I'm already miles away.
