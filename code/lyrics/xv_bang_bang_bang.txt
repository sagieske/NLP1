Song:

[Verse:]
Realities harsh, so I dream through it
Try to give exhale, and I just breathe through it
See I can make a hit, no thing to it
But all y'all do is miss, no ring to it
What I bring to it's like sheet music that he wrote
I'm F'in sharp but the lines have brought
Me nothing but some C notes
My girl a** never be flat, yo girl look like a minor
I've been unemployed forever, but this 'bout to get me higher
To the sky-er, now I test my wings
I got Victoria's Secret angels doing devilish things
Tryna mess with a king they say I mainly model
But I'mma get into acting
I say go break a leg, you might just get casted
And they asking why xv?
At 15 I started rapping. Most of us don't see 21
So when I was young I made it happen
Now look they eyes. I'm 26 and I'm fly
I'm reloaded, I'm reloaded and I'm aimin' til I...

Chorus
Sky high, that's where we aim
We just shootin' for the stars like
Bang, bang, bang
Riiight, it will never change

The sky is where we aim like
Bang, bang, bang. (x2)

[Verse 2:]
Jackasses thought I was done, hoping I crash in fire
Still amazed at all the ones that these raps inspire
Sweet as driving Miss Daisy but streets be driving me crazy
So I'm feeling just like Dinero in Taxi Driver
Watching the growth, you see the flow, you see the shows get live-are
What I gave em was dope, but my new s**t get you higher
I was Richard Pryor to my dreams of Brewster's millions
Now I refuse and let a few fans be my ceiling
A Kansas kid with small town hardships
But flew around those big cities, I'm like Clark Kent
Astronaut dreams, yeah we knew 'em since
So I brought my camp, yeah my crews in tents
We gotta have it, see those stars and gotta grab it
Goofy n***a with a bad b***h. I think I'm Roger Rabbit
But I ain't framing a thing but them plaques I get with my rhymes
I'm reloaded, I'm reloaded and I'm aiming til I'm...
