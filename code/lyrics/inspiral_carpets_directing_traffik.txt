Song:

I read it in a book in school
I read it with 'Janet and John'
No matter how you know the man
You can't trust what he's on
Sometime later when he's on his own
What once was muscle is now bone

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffic

You can't judge a man by his skin
Or a book by the cover it's in
But I can't help feel it's true
The devil's got a hand on you

In a world of laughter
Where the madmen thrive
Sewing up your death-shroud
From the inside

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffic

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffic
[Repeat x1]
Man...
