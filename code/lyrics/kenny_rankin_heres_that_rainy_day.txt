Song:

Maybe I Should Have Saved
Those Leftover Dreams
Funny Here's That Rainy Day

Here's That Rainy Day
They Told Me About
And I Laughed At The Thought
That It Might Turn Out This Way

Where's The Worn Out Wish
That I Threw Aside
After It Brought My Lover Near
And It's Funny How Love Becomes
A Cold Rainy Day
Funny That Rainy Day Is Here

Where's The Worn Out Wish
That I Threw Aside
After It Brought My Lover Near
Funny How Love Becomes
A Cold Rainy Day
Funny That Rainy Day Is Here
We're Clear To Peer
That Rainy Day Is Here
