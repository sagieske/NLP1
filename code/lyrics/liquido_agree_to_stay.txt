Song:

You held my spine
To see me rise
Now taste the silence
A brick of light reveals the day
I smell that you went by
I see now
Agree to stay and spend the night
Don't be alone now
You held my hand
I slipped away
We'd sleep beneath the stars
-
How I hate being scared
The more I think
The more I do
Still anything reminds me of you
I smell your hair
I hear your voice
-
I feel you
I wish we knew a place to play
Where no one could find us
You lied to me
The other day
Don't keep it all inside
-
How I wish I was free
The more I think
The more I do
Still anything reminds me of you
I smell your hair
I hear your voice
-
I feel you
