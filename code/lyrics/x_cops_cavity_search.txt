Song:

It's a dirty job but someones got to do it
So open up your ass so I can look into it
'Cause you never know what you're gonna find
When you ram your fist up a person's behind

Cavity Search on the side of the road
I'm almost positive I'm breking a code
But I'm the one who's in control
It's my job to search your hole

With a rubber glove pulled on my fist
I search your every orifice
Probing you with icy tools
I search for drugs and stir your stools

Cavity Search on the side of the road
I'm almost positive I'm breking a code
But I am here to protect the souls
Of the people who pay me to look up prisoners holes
So drop'em
Spread'em wide
This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me

It's a dirty job but someones got to do it
So open up your ass so I can look into it
'Cause you never know what you're gonna find
When you ram your fist up a person's behind

Cavity search by the side of the road
I know damn well that I'm breaking a code
But I am here to protect the soules
Of the people who pay me to look up your hole
