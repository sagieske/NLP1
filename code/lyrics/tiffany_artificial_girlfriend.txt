Song:

Artificial girlfriend

You're like an accident
I'm not wearing underwear
Stepped in this a thousand times
Should no better but I don't care

You're like a big balloon
I can feel it tied around my neck
Floating higher...pulling tighter
The view from here just takes my breathe away

Baby I just want to hate you
I don't mind
I'll be your artificial girlfriend
Don't ask why
Don't ask why

Make me feel like you're my hero
Make me feel like I'm the one
Temporary satisfaction's go to be better than none at all

Baby I just want to hate you
I don't mind
I'll be your artificial girlfriend
Don't ask why
Don't ask why

You're like an accident
You're like an accident
You're like an accident
I'm not wearing underwear
Stepped in this a thousand times
Should no better but I don't care

Artificial...superficial...unconditional...very special
Artificial...superficial...unofficial...very special
Artificial...superficial...unconditional...very special
Artificial...superficial...unofficial...very special
