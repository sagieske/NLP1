Song:

I can't give you stars that shine
Or the moon above
All I have to offer you
Is True, True Love

A True, True Love
That grows and grows
Forever and a day
Not like the rose
That only grows
Awhile, then fades away...

Tomorrows True, True Love will be
More than it is today.

Tomorrows True, True Love will be
More than it is today.
