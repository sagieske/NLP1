Song:

Well I'm so tired of the rain
Falling softly on the ground
Just enough to get my feet wet
But not enough to let me drown.

I've been laying in my bed
Wishing I had never woken
Begging God to rid my head
Of every word you've ever spoken.

Broke my knuckles on the wall
Because I thought about the call
Where you said you'd always love me.
Do you not tell the truth at all?

Well if I ever cross your mind
Make sure you write down the times
So I will know the moments
I was eating you alive.

And now I lay here
Waiting with the hope that
I might find some sleep.
I need some sleep tonight,
'cause I've been waiting on your call
But I know it will never come
But I'm still waiting by the phone.

And don't you dare (don't you dare)
Say you ever loved me
Or even tell me that you cared
'cause you knew what you were doing
And you know just what you've done.
How dare you say you miss me
With your spit still on his tongue.

I am broken I am beaten
I'm mistreated and I'm torn.
I am cold with no direction
But I'm lost without your warmth.

I'm trying hard to find some hope
That I might get the chance to breathe.
Get off my mind, give back my heart
And get the f**k away from me.

I know I couldn't give you much
But I know I gave my best.
You were always my princess
And now he's sliding up your dress.

And I know I gave the world
Everything I've ever had.
Johnny Cash said love would burn
I never thought it'd hurt this bad.

Well I'm so tired of the rain
Falling softly on the ground
Just enough to get my feet wet
But not enough to let me drown.

I've been laying in my bed
Wishing I had never woken
Begging God to rid my head
Of every word you've ever spoken.

Broke my knuckles on the wall
Because I thought about the call
Where you said you'd always love me.
Do you not tell the truth at all?

Well if I ever cross your mind
Make sure you write down the times
So I will know the moments
I was eating you alive.

You are the itch that's on my back.
You are the gum under my shoe.
You are the horrors of my past.
You are the chill that haunts the room.

You are the creaking on my steps.
You are cancer, you are plague,
You are regret, you are disease.
I wish that you would go away.
