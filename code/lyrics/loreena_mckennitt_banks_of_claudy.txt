Song:

Trad. arr. by Loreena McKennitt
As I walked out one morning
All in the month of May
Down by a flower garden
I carelessly did stray
I overheard a young maid
In sorrow did complain,
All for her absent lover
Who plows the ranging main.
I boldly stepped up to her
And put her in surprise.
I know she did not know me
I being in disguise.
I says, "Me charming creature,
My joy, my hearts delight,
How far have you to travel
This dark and dreary night?"
"I'm in search of a faithless young man.
Johnny is his name.
And along the Banks of Claudy
I'm told he does remain."
"This is the Banks of Claudy
Fair maid where on you stand.
But don't depend on Johnny
For he's a false young man.
Oh don't depend on Johnny
For he'll not meet you here.
But tarry with me in yon green woods
No danger need you fear.
Oh it's six long weeks or better
Since Johnny left the shore
He's crossing the wild ocean
Where the foam and the billows roar.
He's crossing the wild ocean
For honour and for fame.
But ths I've heard, the ship was wrecked
All on the coast of Spain."
Oh it's when she heard this dreadful news
She flew into despair.
By the wringing of her milk white hands
And the tearing of her hair.
Saying "If Johnny he is drowned
No man on earth I'll take,
But through lonesome groves and valleys
I'll wander for his sake."
Oh it's when he saw her loyalty
No longer could he stand
He flew into her arms saying
"Betsy I'm the man."
"Saying Betsy I'm the young man
The cause of all your pain
But since we've met on Claudy Banks
We'll never part again."
