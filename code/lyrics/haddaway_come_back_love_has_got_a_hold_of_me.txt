Song:

I stay
I decide
I never wanted to see your face again
But when you passed me by
I was back on fire

Love
Love has got a hold of me
(Baby just can't you see)
Love
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me)
Come back

Since I closed my eyes and
Made a picture of you in my mind
My love is eating me
I want you by my side

Love
Love has got a hold of me
(Baby just can't you see)
Love
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me)
Come back

(Oh, come back)
(Oh, come back)
Come back
Come back

Love (love)
Love has got a hold of me
(Baby just can't you see)
Love (love)
Love has got a hold of me (hold of me)
Love
Love has, love has
Love has, love has got a hold of me
Come back...
