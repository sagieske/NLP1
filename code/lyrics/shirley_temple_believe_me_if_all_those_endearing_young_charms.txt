Song:

Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
Which I gaze on so fondly today
Were to change by tomorrow,
And fleet in my arms
Like fairy gifts fading away,
Thou wouldst still be adored,
As this moment thou art,
Let thy lovliness fade as it will;
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
Would entwine itself verdantly still!
