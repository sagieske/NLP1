[Whistling]

Eh!... Chineke me!... Ew!

Ala Oyi e!.. Ala Oyi e!
Ala Oyi e!.. Ala Oyi e!

For instance
Say na me be one wey dey give chance
Say na me be one wey dey make plans
For all man to benefit
Abi to make we disagree
Abi na to create chance
But now am not of importance
Cos now I am looking from a distance
That's why you give them the chance
To turns us... To turns to victim of circumstance
Them just dey ignore our existence
Them just dey use excuse buy chance
Like them no know say we dey
Them dey use us dey play
...
When we stand for resistance
All in the act of exploitance
Abi we just be living in a trance
Ayi oh! My God!
Ala Oyi e!

This thing that am feeling
Is a feeling of love
And you know say is so... Ala Oyi e!
This thing no go go
Then you know I go slow... Ala Oyi e!
This thing is affecting your thing
And is killing your soul... Ala Oyi e!
See this type of thing we we dey feel
They make me dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!
Even if I want to dey cheat
I go still dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!
Stand look around you
I bet you go dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!.
Ala Oyi e! For the thing wey you see wey make you Ala Oyi e!

For instance
Say na me be Baale of Nigerians
Say na me be one wey dey make plan
Say I go create a scenery where better go plenty
Make we dey give chance
Instead to dey pack the money go France
To make suffer to full in abundance
To make me run run away
To a place where ebi say
I go feel like Europeans
Where them go respect my skills for instance
Where them no go dey play pranks
Ontop people wey work the way
Wey give them the key
To chop substance
As them know say we be freelance
Their looting no dey give us assurance
Repentance no dey their plane
E dey create annoyance for my heart
So Ala Oyi e!

This thing that am feeling
Is a feeling of love
And you know say is so... Ala Oyi e!
This thing no go go
Then you know I go slow... Ala Oyi e!
This thing is affecting your thing
And is killing your soul... Ala Oyi e!
See this type of thing we we dey feel
They make me dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!
Even if I want to dey cheat
I go still dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!
Stand look around you
I bet you go dey want to dey... Ala Oyi e!.
Ala Oyi e! For the thing wey you see wey make you Ala Oyi e!

Make we dey give chance... Ala Oyi e!
Instead to dey pack the money go France... Ala Oyi e!
To make suffer to full in abundance... Ala Oyi e!
Ala Oyi e!.... Ala Oyi e!... Ala Oyi e!
