Song:

Ever since my life began,
There've been times I need somebody here,
To help me understand.
I can find my plan with a helping hand from you.
Your help will do.
And I'll be here to help you too.
Ever since my time was new,
There's been things I need somebody here,
To help me try and do.
I can see them through with a helping hand from you.
Your help will do.
And I'll be here to help you through.
And I'll be here to help you too.
Ever since the world was made,
There's been times a person needs to find a friend who's not afraid,
And I know I'll do the things I got to do workin' with you.
I've got a helping hand,
Waiting to hold your hand.
I've got a helping hand for you.
I've got a helping hand,
Waiting to hold your hand.
I've got a helping hand for you.
I've got a helping hand for you.
