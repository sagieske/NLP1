Song:

A call from your house but you're not there
You're beyond all fear

Like a fairytail you are living in my head now
You shine like a star

If I could give you time what would that meen
You could have stay here everything could've been fine

If I could set you free what would that meen
Then you would live forever more now I see

It could have been me
It should have been me
With god and he's angels
I still ask why

It could have been you
It should have been you in pain and in loss now
Let me fly

Years have gone by but the voice in my head
They still ask why

I wonder where you are I can still see you
You could'nt gone that far

If I culd give you time
What wuold that meen
You culd have stayed here
Everything culd been fine

If I could set you free what would that meen
Then you would live forever more now I see

It could have been me
It should have been me
With god and he's angels
I still ask why

It could have been you
It should have been you in pain and in loss now
Let me fly

It could have been me
It should have been you
With god and he's angels
Let me fly

It could have been me
It should have been me
With god and he's angels
I still ask why
