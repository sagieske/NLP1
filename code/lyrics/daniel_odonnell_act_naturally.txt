Song:

Well, they're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally.

Well, I bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well.

I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
All I got to do is act naturally.

--- Instrumental ---

We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And Begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally.

I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well.

I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally.

Yes, all I got to do is act naturally...
