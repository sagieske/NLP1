Song:

Come out of a fireball
Notes burning and the letters scrawled
I ain't ever goin' back no more

Bare light blub and a hotplate
Was there that I finally met my fate
And I ain't ever goin' back no more

She danced the room and she made it fine
I sang a song about a crooked line
And I ain't ever goin' back no more

She's my first love and she's my last
Don't ask me how it ever came to pass
'Cause I ain't ever goin' back no more

I ain't going back no more
Wouldn't even try to find that door
And I ain't ever goin' back no more

I don't care what the past has in store
I ain't ever goin' back no more
I ain't ever goin' back no more

A pint of gin and a long bus trip
Somebody said you just get over it
I ain't ever goin' back no more

I see her face at every shitty bar
I have to play to pay for this guitar
I ain't ever goin' back no more

I'm singing every song for her tonight
So bartender would you hit the lights
'Cause I ain't ever goin' back no more

A little something to remember me
It's been so long Lord she musn't see
I ain't ever goin' back no more
I ain't ever goin' back

I ain't goin' back no more
Wouldn't even try to find that door
I ain't ever goin' back no more

I don't care what the past has in store
I ain't ever goin' back no more
I ain't ever goin' back no more

Dust settles in a darkened room
Whiskey steals away the sense of doom
I ain't ever goin' back no more

We made love and we made hate
Never could seem to get it straight
I ain't ever goin' back no more baby

You're branded on my soul and in my mind
I keep running up and down this old fence line
I ain't ever goin' back no more

Only one thing in my life is true
Honey I will remember you
I ain't ever goin' back no more

I ain't ever goin' back no more
Wouldn't even try to find that door
I ain't ever goin' back no more

I don't care what the past has in store
I ain't ever goin' back no more
I ain't ever goin' back no more
