Song:

You drive me crazy
Out of my mind
You really do it to me
You're one of a kind.
You sucked me in like a magnet
Now I'm addicted to you
I'm always ready,
Ready for you.

Chorus:
You turned me on
You make me explode
Too much is never enough.
With ecstacy you'll give it to me
Too much is never enough.

You taste so sweet, baby, Angel in heat
You're so sweet, Angel in heat.

The way you do it to me
The way you use your lips
You make me scream
N' we go down for another trip.
Neverending feeling
The way it must be
Our desire
Brings us higher.

Repeat Chorus.

I know you love it
N' I love it too
You give it to me
N' I give it to you
Keep on, keep on
Never stop
Let's go over the top.

Repeat Chorus.
