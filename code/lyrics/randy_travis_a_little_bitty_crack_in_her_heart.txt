Song:

(Shawn Camp/Jim Rushing)

Shattered inside and scattered around
Were pieces of her broken heart
I gathered her up, the pieces I found
I put her back together like a busted guitar
But osme glue holds and some glue don't In spite of everything I tried
Somebody's stole my darlin'
Right before my very eyes

He didn't walk, talk or push his way in
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playin' no harp
As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

Copin' with hone and hoping i'm wrong
But I sure see a definite change
There's look in her eyes that's sayin' goodbye
And her snuggle when I hold her don't feel the same
The way her heart bests for that sneaky theif
You would picture him dark and tall
But the feller that stole my darlin'
Lord, he'd have to be very small

He didn't walk, talk or push his way in
Or fly through the windows on a gust of hot wind
He didn't sprout wings
And he sure wasn't playin' no harp
As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart

As low as he was, I couldn't see him
Slitherin' around in the dark
He must've crawled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
Lord, he must've craweled through
A little bitty crack in her heart
