Song:

Daddy and the devil walk side by side
Me and momma, we tried to hide
He couldn't stay sober if he tried
Daddy and the devil walked side by side

The devil had a hold on daddy's hand
He never had a straight and narrow plan
Down a dark and deadend road they ran
The devil had a hold on daddy's hand

Chorus:
He took his soul and he took his pride
But the devil still ain't satisfied
We all cried the day he died
Daddy and the devil walked side by side

Daddy and the devil were the best of friends
We all know that story's end
But it's the son who pays for the father's sins
Daddy and the devil were the best of friends

Chorus
Years gone by and I'm a full grown man
It took a lot of living to understand
How a good man falls for the devil's plans
The devil had a hold on daddy's hand

Chorus

Daddy and the devil walked side by side
