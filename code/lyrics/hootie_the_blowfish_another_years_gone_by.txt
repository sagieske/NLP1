Song:

Oh my God what do I see, over my shoulder
Now that a year's gone by
Can't escape this memory, it's burning brighter
Now that a year's gone by
And I try, not to linger, but I'll still cry
Now that a year's gone by
I hope we'll try to find some peace
Take from our history what is meant to be
Eventually the truth is plain to see
Another year's gone by
Oh my God it's part of me, this burning anger
I feel the fever rise, fill my heart with harmony
Let it spill over, touch us deep inside
So an eye, it won't be taken, for an eye
Now that a year's gone by
I hope we'll try to find some peace
Take from our history what is meant to be
Eventually the truth is plain to see
Another year's gone by
Oh my God please answer me, why are we fighting
If you're on everybody's side
If we can't stop this misery in your name and put our fear aside
We'll be gone before we know it, blink of an eye
Another year's gone by
I hope we'll try to find some peace
Take from our history what is meant to be
Eventually the truth is plain to see
Another year's gone by
