Song:

Hi rak merachefet baolam shela
La la la la
Vehu menase lagaat
Hi nirtaat
Lo yodaat
Ata yoshev bapina umitbonen ba-ba
Baerev mitardema mitorer
Roe chalon patuach
Velo batuach
Ma la kara
Ma hi asta
Poched shehi kaftsa-tsa
Mibachuts hi afa
Al anan katan banta
Migdal shakuf bemikchol
Uvetocho afim
Kol hamal'achim
Vekol hafeyot haktanot
Rokdot bemaagal mistovev
Bli sof
La la la la la la
English translation
She just floats in her world
And he tries to touch
She recoils
Does not know
You sit in the corner and watch her
In the evening
You wake up from sleep
See an open window
And are not sure
What has happened to her
What has she done
You fear she has jumped
Outside she flies
On a little cloud
She has built a transparent tower
With a paintbrush
And inside it
All the angels fly
And all the little fairies dance
In a circle turning round and round
Endlessly
