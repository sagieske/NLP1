Konvict

Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

Ooooooh

How can I tell somebody what I've been feelling
Looking at me and think that I'll be tripping
But say what you want 'cause baby that means nothing
I play this game but now I'm tired of frontin'

Who needs your lovin'? I do
Who needs your touch and your comfort when you caressin'? I do
Nobody loves me like you
And when I'm needin' a fix nobody do it like you

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me that I couldn't do it (without you on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
I'm in the fast lane, but I'm cruising (with you by my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you (on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

I'm not your bird without wing, I'm tryin to get higher
Giving my everything light this fire
Wanna talk about you, wanna be about you
Oh 'cause I can't live without you

Who needs your lovin'? I do
Who needs your touch and your comfort when you caressin'? I do
Nobody loves me like you
And when I'm needin' a fix nobody do it like you

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it Think of little me that I couldn't do it (without you on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
I'm in the fast lane, but I'm cruising (with you by my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you (on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

Akon:
Dear God here's my letter
Writing to you coz my life has gotten a lot better
Got heart but I didn't sweat it coz I know you'll be there for me no matter the weather
I just wanna say thanks for being there for me everyday
And when I got taken away wanted to get away
You made me stronger to continue the fight
You made me give up the life I had on the streets
Gets rough and I've been on the hold on
Never questioned that you're the one that I call Lord
And just wanna show you I appreciate
Thank you for the rest no matter what it is

Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me that I couldn't do it (without you on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
I'm in the fast lane, but I'm cruising (with you by my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you (on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

Sometimes I gotta fight, just to get through it
Think of little me that I couldn't do it (without you on my side)
Silly si-silly me to think that I could leave you
Silly si-silly me to think that I don't need you

I got to stop so I don't lose it
I'm in the fast lane, but I'm cruising
