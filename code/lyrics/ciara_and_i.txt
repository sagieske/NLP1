Song:

[Verse:]
I don't need me a basketball player
All I need is somebody that's down for me
And he don't have to have money
His love is just like honey
It's so sweet to me
He could have everything in this world
But he'll sacrifice it all for me
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And it feels so real

[Chorus:]
And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
Its time, time for us to settle down
And I
Wanna be with him forever

[Verse 2:]
They can say that I am crazy
For making him my baby
But it's how it's gone be
See I done been through many changes
But this time I aint changing
It's gone stay the same
I can have everything in this world
But i'll sacrifice it all for him
And I made up my mind
I'm in love this time
And it, it feels real

[Chorus:]
And I
Know that he won't break my heart
And I
Know that we won't never part
Its time, time for us to settle down
And I
Wanna be with him forever more

[Bridge:]
I love you
And all of the things that you do
Oh baby please
I need you [ I need you]
So believe me [ I do ]
I do [ oooooo]
Cause I love you [ I love you]
And every lil thing baby [you do]
No no Ooo whoooooa Ooooo
They don't know how I feel
Cause I know this is real

[Chorus:] [2x]
