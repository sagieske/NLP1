Song:

But... Jesus comes to me While
I watch and wait And
long for peace He

is always there It's
where I belong For
the road I'm on is long Be

with Him I'll
be with Him Until
the day I die And

Jesus comes to me He's
my everything He's
all I need (for me) And

His voice I hear (I hear it all the time) He's
opened up my eyes It's
clear the reason why Be

with Him I'll
be with Him Until
the day I die Until

the day I die Jesus
comes to lead me on Taking
me home with Him Where
I'll be with Him forever
