Song:

I was foolin
When I said I'd always love you
Just foolin
When I said that I'd be true

Now you're gone
There's an achin that I can't seem to lose
And I wonder
Was I ever foolin you

And now that I realize
I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me
Just who the fool could be

But this time believe me
I'm not foolin you
I just can't talk my heart
Into unlovin you

And now that I realize
That I can't have you
It's finally dawned on me
Just who the fool could be

But this time believe me
I'm not foolin you
I just can't talk my heart
Into unlovin you

This time believe me
I'm not foolin you
I just can't talk my heart
Into unlovin you
