Song:

Nick:
I don't know what he does To make you cry
But I'll be there to make You smile
I don't have
A fancy car
To get to you I'd walk
A thousand miles

Brian:
I don't care
If he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know
But if you were my girl,
I'd make it so we'd never be apart

Chorus:
But my love is
All I Have to Give
Without you I don't
Think I can live
I wish I could give
The world to you
But love is all I have to give

Howie:
When you talk
(When you talk)
Does it seem like he's not even listenin' to a word
You say?
That's okay baby
Just tell me your problems
I'll try my best
To kiss them all away

Aj:
Does he leave
(Does he leave)
When you need him the most
Does his friends get all
Your time?
Baby please
I'm on my knees
Prayin' for the day
That you'll be mine

Chorus:
But my love is all
I Have to Give
Without you I don't
Think I can live
I wish I could give
The world to you
But love is all I have to give

Nick:
Hey girl,
I don't want you
To cry no more inside

Howie:
Oooh, all the money
In the world

Brian:
Could never add up to

Aj:
All the love I have inside

Chorus:
But my love is all
I Have to Give
Without you I don't
Think I could live
I wish I could give
The world to you
But love is all I have to give

Nick:
To you.

Brian: Ooooooooooh

All:
With out you I don't
Think I could live
Give the world to you, lady
But love is all I have to give

Brian:
That's all I got give
