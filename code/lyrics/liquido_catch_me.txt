Song:

Gotta get this feeling once again .
Why can't you ever keep me save from harm .
Watching colours form, minutes passing by .
This time I'm on my own I'm here to stay .
Turning upside down .
Everything that comes around goes around .
Something more than ordinary life .
Pulling inside out .

Over the top - I'm sliding from the edge .
Catch me I'm falling down, falling down .
Catch me I'm falling down, falling down .
I'm on my way .
I'm on my way .
All is fixed so face it one more time .

In a small world that I call my own .
Intrusive noises never let me go .
Simple awesome notes (that's) what I want to hear .
Pathetic neighbours jumping up and down .
Turning upside down .
Daily sadness melted from the sun .
Pulling inside out .
Over the top I'm sliding from the edge .

I'm on my way .
Catch me I'm falling down, falling down .
I'm on my wayCatch me I'm falling down, falling down .
