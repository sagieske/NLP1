Song:

Drive by my house late at night
You can see from the freeway above
No silhouette, but a light left on
Burning there for love

Smoke is rising from the fire
Coming out my back door
I'm inside, sound asleep
Cigarette on the floor
Burning there for love

Well i can still remember
A couple of years ago
When the smoke and flame called my name
It was a burning house of love

That rusty nail over our front door
Is where i hung our tears in the rain
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds
To see what luck can bring

Cause you're in your bed, i'm in mine
On either side of town
I think i might take a ride
And burn your love house down
Like a burning house of love
