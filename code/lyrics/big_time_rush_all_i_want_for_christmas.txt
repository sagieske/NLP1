Song:

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer's click

Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding onto me so tight
What more can I do?
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

Oh! All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly everywhere)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air, oh woah
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me? Oh

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

All I want for Christmas is you baby
You're all I want
You're all I need
A Christmas day baby you and me

You're all I want
You're all I need
A Christmas Day baby you and me
