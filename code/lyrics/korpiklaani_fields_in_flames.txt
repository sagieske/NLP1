Song:

They rode
Those two hundred men
Narrow roads
Through this dark cold land

They burnt all villages
They raped and destroyed
Took gold, silver and coins

They burnt all villages
They raped and destroyed
Took gold, silber and coins

Taxes to King was their mission
But pain and sorrow they left behind

They drank all booze
They stole and killed
Fields in Flames and
Families without homes

They drank all booze
They stole and killed
Fields in Flames and
Families without homes

Men with their golden swords
Horses armoured heads
Iron harassed hard
Blades of weapons slashed
In silence the village lie down
Hearts bleeding morbid sorrow

One man of these men of the death
One man, broke down

Down he went with insanity
Down man, lunatic

Down he went with insanity
Down man, lunatic

He lit the fire under the house
You could only see his feet

He burnt away his insanity
Burnt away those memories

He burnt away his insanity
Burnt away those memories

Men with their golden swords
Horses armoured heads
Iron harassed hard
Blades of weapons slashed
In silence the village lie down
Hearts bleeding morbid sorrow
