Song:

And if I ever fall in love again
I'll try to let my heart be free
Cause I know how it feels to be alone
Still trapped in old memories
And if I ever fall in love again
I'll search to find a love that's true
I need a lover who will share my life
And help make my love renewed

I'm not lost I've been here before
But everything has changed
No need to cry just dry my eyes
And let my heart show me the way

Chorus:

Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way
'Cause I need someone to love
Forever and always

And if I ever fall in love again
I know you'll be my lover and friend
And if I ever hold you in my arms
No nothing could tear us apart
And if I ever wanna hear you say
Darlin' I love you to me everyday
The only way to know our love love is right
It must pass the test of time

Now I'm not lost I've been here before
But everything has changed
No need to cry just dry my eyes
And let my heart show me the way

Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way
'Cause I need someone to love
Forever and always

Now I'm not lost I've been here before
But everything has changed
No need to cry just dry my eyes
And let my heart show me the way

Send me someone to love and I'll be on my way
'Cause I need someone to love
Forever and always

And if I ever fall in love
