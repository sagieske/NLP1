Song:

I mean this,
I'm not sure if you could say the same

Week after week after week
Idolatry is wasted reverence,
Idolatry is the yellow on your teeth

Gasp for the truth you once lived,
Beyond this world,

Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
Beyond this world is worth dying for,
Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
Beyond this world is worth dying for,

I remember what you used to claim,
What you used to claim,
You can't bury conviction with anything

Our message will grow,
Our message will grow,
No matter the mistakes made within construction

Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
Beyond this world is worth dying for
Beyond this world is what is always breathing,
Beyond this world is worth dying for

Gasp for the truth you once lived,
I pray that stolen glimpses do not subtract from what we've been building,
Keep stride persist in our march
