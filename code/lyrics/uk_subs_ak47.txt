Song:

There's something going down on the other side of town.
Smoke rising. City burning down - Mr. Ak47

Now there's burning and looting all down the street.
Police fire warning nobody heeds - Mr. Ak47

We're just one move closer to heaven. Got my ak47

The rich man won't take no blame and the poor man is just easy game.
And the next day you're out on the street, tossed out with the garbage.

Now you stand by the grave side, you look up to heaven.
There's a prophet with an ak47

There's blood on the hands, there's blood on the floor.
It runs down the hallway and out of the door
Into the street it joins a little more...
