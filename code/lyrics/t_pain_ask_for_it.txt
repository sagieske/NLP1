la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la, la la..
Ohh..

(T-PAIN)
It's been 2 months and 20 days
the last time I layed my eyes on you
(and I'm sick and tired)
of not bein around you
(and I'm sick and tired)
of not seeing your face
and baby I know...
that It's killing you too
I can hear it in your voice
when I'm talking to you
(on the phone late at night)
my conclusion is
(bein alone ain't right)
so confused babe
some nights i cry
(thinking about you babe, cant do with out you babe, please believe)
that I got this thing covered and
you ain't ever gotta worry bout nothin
so baby please tell me

(CHORUS X2)
if theres anything you want(want)
anything you need (need)
there aint nothin in this world that you cannot have
all you gotta do is ask for it
all you gotta do is ask for it

(NIVEA)
many nights I cried
thinkin about you boy
I've been dreamin about you boy
now we're seperated boy
theres one thing to say
but you gotta show you love me
because it's 15 min after 3 and im still waiting to see you
and I, I... I'm so tired of it boy
and I, I... done everything I could for sure
I've been sittin alone and I'm so gone
and I know you miss me
I'll be out the door coming back no more
no I don't want speak to you..you you you..
I did anything for you babe
everything for you babe
used to say that I had you sprung
used to treat me like I'm the one
guess I'll give u another chance
don bring all tha bull that shit again
I I I... I I I..
I... I...

(T-PAIN)
tell me

(CHORUS X4)
if theres anything you want(want)[anything]
anything you need (need)[anything]
there ain't nothing in this world that you cannot have
all you gotta do is ask for it
all you gotta do is ask for it
