Song:

April doesn't shower her sweet love on me
What someone gets in one day may take me two or three
Yes it's true she leads me like a puppet on a string
But my life without April is like next year without spring.

People say that April treats me cruel
But I just smile when they say there goes April's fool.

The first time I met April was in the middle of December
And she's taught me so many things I'd rather not remember
In wintertime she has me wearing summer clothes
In summer she has jack frost nipping up my nose.

People say that April treats me cruel
But I just smile when they say there goes April's fool.

But I just smile when they say there goes April's fool.
But I just smile when they say there goes April's fool...
