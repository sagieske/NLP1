Song:

It's not a secret, 
It's not fairytale, 
It's not made up, 
Jonah was in the whale, 
For three whole days, 
123! 

The greatest treasure, 
The word God's people wrote, 
It's in the bible, 
Where Noah built a boat, 
And it rained and rained, 

The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
For your everyday.

It's not a secret, 
It's not a fairytale, 
It's not made up, 
Jonah was in the whale, 
For three whole days, 
123! 

The greatest treasure, 
The word God's people wrote, 
It's in the bible, 
Where Noah built a boat, 
And it rained and rained, 

The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
For your everyday.

This side, give me a scream that your having fun! 
This side, give me a scream that your having fun! 

The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
The rainbows in the sky, 
To show God's promises are true, 
The rainbows in the sky to show the world, 
He's the only way, 
For your everyday, 
He's the only way.
