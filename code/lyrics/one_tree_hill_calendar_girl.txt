Song:

If I am lost for a day
Try to find me
But if I don't come back then I won't look behind me
And all of the things that I thought were so easy
Just got harder and harder each day
December is darkest
In June there's the light
But this empty bedroom
Won't make anything right
While out on the landing
A friend I forgot to send home
Who waits up for me
All through the night
Calendar girl who's in love with the world
Stay alive!
I dreamed I was dying as I so often do
And when I awoke I was sure it was true
I ran to the window
Threw my head to the sky
And said whoever is up there
Please don't let me die
But I can't live forever
I can't always be
One day I'll be sand on a beach by the sea
The pages keep turning
I mark off each day with a cross
And I'll laugh about all that we've lost
Calendar girl
Who is lost to the world
Stay alive!
Calendar girl who is lost to the world
Stay alive!
January, February, March, April, May
I'm alive!
June, July, August, September, October
I'm Alive!
November, December and all through the winter
I'm Alive!
I'm alive...
