Song:

I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realized
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something, somewheres got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When youve reached the bottom
It's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart
But I don't show it, show it
Then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it
Don't make me promises
Baby you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you
Now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you've reached the bottom
It's now or never
Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here
With nothing...

Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've
Got no more room
No room inside for me in your life

Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

Is it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you've reached the bottom
It's now or never

Is it all
Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call
You leave me here
With nothing at all

All...
