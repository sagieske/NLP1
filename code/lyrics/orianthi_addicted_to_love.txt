Song:

Is this love- or am I just a fool
Why do you keep on breaking my
Heart right into two
(And don't you know that I)
I can't help it, I can't can't help it
I can't help it, I just can't help it
I know you're bad for me but I'm so good for you
I try to walk away but that I can't do

[Chorus:]
Though I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love
And it hurts when I miss you
So I'm not givin' up cause I'm addicted to love
It's so wrong that it's right
Don't leave me tonight
Make my heart beat faster, yeah you bring me to life
And I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love

Look in my eyes- I wanna read your soul
I wanna take it all in 'til I start to lose control
(And don't you know that I)
I can't help it, I can't can't help it
I can't help it, I just can't help it
You're like a drug to me what am I gonna do
I gotta have it all I need a hit of you

[Chorus:]
Though I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love
And it hurts when I miss you
So I'm not givin' up cause I'm addicted to love
It's so wrong that it's right
Don't leave me tonight
Make my heart beat faster, yeah you bring me to life
And I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love

We have been on this crazy high flying to
The sky- then crashing down so low
You're a high that I just can't kick
No I just can't quit, oh no

(Guitar solo)

Though I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love
And it hurts when I miss you
So I'm not givin' up cause I'm addicted to love
Though I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love
And it hurts when I miss you
So I'm not givin' up cause I'm addicted to love
It's so wrong that it's right
Don't leave me tonight
Make my heart beat faster, yeah you bring me to life
And I try to forget you
But I can't cause I'm addicted to love
