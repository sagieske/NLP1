Song:

(Eddie):
Whatever happened to saturday night?
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?
It donґt seem the same since the cosmic light.
You came into my life and I thought I was divine.
I used to go for a ride with a chick whoґd go
And listen to the music on the radio.
A saxophone was blowing on a rockґnґroll show
And you climbed in the back and you really had a good time!

(All):
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!

(Eddie):
My head used to swim from the perfume I smelt.
My hands kind of fumbled with her white
Plastic belt.
Iґd taste her baby pink lipstick and thatґs
When Iґd melt.
And she whispered in my ear tonight she
Really was mine.
Get back in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song.
With your arm around your girl youґd try
To sing along.
You felt pretty good ґcause youґd really had a good time!

(All):
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
Hot Patootie bless my soul.
I really love that rockґnґroll!
