Song:

Who would have thought we'd feel this way
Finding a million things to say
Knowing our dream is coming true
So, girl come here and lay down by my side
Give me the love that's in your eyes
It'll be good just holding on tight
And share in the night.

Chorus:
So stay and we'll explore each other, stay
And see what we'll discover, hey
There's so much of you that I don't know
And though, it may not last forever, oh
It feels so right together, no
We just can't let it go.

Now that I'm listening to your side
Seeing the laughter in your eyes
Even the warmth of loving you.
Here, here in your arms it last a long
Lost in a glow I never know
Now that I found you
Just don't let it end
I wanna love you again...

(Repeat chorus)

I've had enough of being on my own
The emptiness of waking up alone
But when the morning finds we're lying here
We smile and say hello
Don't ask why, it's you and I...

(Repeat chorus)

No, we just can't let it go
