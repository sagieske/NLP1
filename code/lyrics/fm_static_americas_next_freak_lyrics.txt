Song:

This songs for the emo kids with the punk-rock, rockabilly screamo lids
And the crunk-rock, hip-hop and metal queens
Who still don't know what the heck that means
Lets cheer for the real mcs
All the east west 30 sound straight ogs
With the hippy rock hardcore alt countries
With the techno industrial magazine

I don't know where I fit in
But every time that records spins
I know the way it makes me feel
And I never tried to be your trend
Never asked to be everyone's friend
I'm just who I am and that's life for real
And every time you try to just remember...

That I won't be Americas Next Freak
I will not lay down every time you speak
And if all you see is Americas Next Freak
Take me home, take me home, take me home

This ones for the Phyllis Deans
And the beach boys rocking in the Philippines
With the twist top x-box strategies
All speaking French, Spanish, and Portuguese
And one time for the half to bites
With the super low low carb atckins diets
And the man with the plan in the corduroy
Who just brought back the backstreet boys

I don't know where I fit in
But every time that records spins
I know the way it makes me feel
And I never tried to be your trend
Never asked to be everyone's friend
I'm just who I am and that's life for real
And every time you try to just remember...

That I won't be Americas Next Freak
I will not lay down every time you speak
And if all you see is Americas Next Freak
Take me home, take me home, take me home

I don't see anything around me
I wont be, I wont be
I don't see anything around me
I wont be, I wont be
If you don't see, then makes me blind
Cause I wont see, I wont see
It makes me sick, it makes me smile
Cause I wont be, I wont be

I won't be Americas Next Freak
I will not lay down every time you speak
And if all you see is America's Next Freak
Take me home, take me home, just take me home

That I won't be Americas Next Freak
I will not lay down every time you speak
And if all you see is Americas Next Freak
Take me home, take me home, just take me home
