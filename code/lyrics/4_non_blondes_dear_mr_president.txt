Song:

I'm looking outside of my window
The view that I see
And the child is begging for money
Is a child and mama
Tell me why, tell me why
Is she so broke
The woman is blind
The kid's dealing crime
It's such a beautiful city,
But the word is burning it down
I go to my room to turn on the tv
I sit myself down
And I start laughing hard
'cause this man he's asking for money
I'll send you stuff to make you rich fast"
He say "if you send me lots of cash
But the man he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
One day I'm going to have lots of money
And it's called the us of A
But I'll have to give it up for this rich society
Oh please Mr. President will you lend me a future
'cause you'll just get it back
With the kid on the corner
From the little blind woman
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And the people full over, doin' crack
Yea yea yea yea yea
But the man he's burning it down
It's such a wonderful country
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
And it's burning down
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's called the us of A
I'm walking outside on a sunny day
With no one around
And I wonder what's wrong
Then I hear this loud piercing siren
And everybody climbed right on top screaming
Oh my God the bomb has just dropped
What a wonderful country
But the man he's burning it down
He's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
But the man he's burning it down
Yea yea yea yea yea
Yea yea yea yea yea yea
It's such a wonderful country
Yea yea yea yea yea
And it's called the us of A and it's burning down
