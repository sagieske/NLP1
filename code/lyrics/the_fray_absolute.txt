Song:

I've seen this one before, the girl she gets away 
Everybody knows it but no one tries to stop it 
Cause she barely even knows him but if she could see inside 
Everything is quiet as she waits to tell him who she is 

Is this all we get to be absolute 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear 

It's a kiss sits upon on her lips that waits for planes and battle ships 
She wants to be a dancer and he has got a picture 
On his wall and it's a sailor in a new port every night 
Yet man was born to trouble like sparks fly upwards innocent 

Is this all we get to be absolute 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear 

All we are and all we want 
40 years come and gone 
All we are in photographs 
Will never be taken 

Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want you here 
Quiet but I'm sure there is something here 
Tell me everything cause I want to hear
