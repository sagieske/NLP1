[Verse:]
Back when I was a young n***a
Playing in the sand
I had some big dreams so
I made a little plan
You was out partying while
I was thinking in advance
Try'n'a get right hoping
That one day I'd be the man
The years went by
I was in my A
I got rid of all of the n****s
That was in my way
I saved nickels and quarters
'till I could afford a studio
To record and then get money
Off the s**t I say
Then my dream came true and
The fraud n****s came out
See my ballin' out they all
We all gettin' paid now
Talking like "Hopsin, oh
You're a great pal"
F**k you, stick my balls
In your dang mouth
Now every other week
You hit me up for money
Frontin' like you always been down (pow!)
But back then when
A n***a was living bummy
Your a** was nowhere to be found (wow!)

What my n***a I ain't tryin to be one of ya fake a** goldigger
Homies that's not it (that's not what I'm doin)
But hey I want 500 dollas I'mma pay ya a** back next week man I promise (please)

[Hook:]
I can't even make friends
Cause all they ever do is ask for my money
They like let have this
Let me have that
Let me have this and they keep on coming (man)
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money
Let me get a dollar, Give me that money!
