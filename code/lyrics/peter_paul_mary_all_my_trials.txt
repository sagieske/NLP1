Song:

All my trials Lord, soon be over.

I had a little book was given to me,
And ev'ry page spelled Liberty,
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

If religion were a thing that money could buy,
The rich would live, and the poor would die,
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind,
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

There is a tree in Paradise,
The Pilgrims call it The Tree of Life,
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind,
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

All my trials Lord, soon be over.
