Song:

EXCHANGE OF HEARTS
David Slater
(David Slater)

One-sided love broke the see-saw down
I got to get rough when I hit the ground
And you went your way and I went wild
And girl, you'd understand if your heart was mine

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts

I'd never wished a lonely heart on you
It's not your fault, I chose to play the fool
One day may come when you'll be in my shoes
Then your heart will break and you'll feel just like I do

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts

When time turns the tables and soon I'll be able
To find a new romance
And then you'll remember my love warm and tender
Too late for a second chance

(Instrumental)

If we had an exchange of hearts
Then you'd know why I fell apart
You'd feel the pain when the mem'ries start
If we had an exchange of hearts
