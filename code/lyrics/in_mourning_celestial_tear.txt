Song:

So swift, embraced by you, you're silent, I travel alone
I breathe in memories, through barricades of stone

Who are you, I once met light from another angle, in another time
In your eyes, a solitaire, a vast dream far behind
If you were blind, if we were blind, could we then have been much closer

Fallen inside you, a celestial tear
If the waves could drown our emotions, would it be my fault
I cry for you a celestial tear
If we were only memories from other times

Who are you, I once met light from other angles, and other crimes
I breathe in memories through barricades of stone
If you were close, if we were close, would we then have been much blinder
