Song:

I get such a thrill
When you look in my eyes
My heart skips a beat, girl
I feel so alive
Please tell me baby
If all this is true
'Cause deep down inside
All I wanted was you

Ohhhh...
Makes me wanna dance
Ohhhh...
It's a new romance
Ohhhh...
I look into your eyes
Ohhhh...
Best years of our lives

When we first met
I could hardly believe
The things that were happening
We could achieve
So let's stay together
For all of our time
Girl I'm so grateful
That you are still mine

Ohhhh...
Makes me wanna dance
Ohhhh...
It's a new romance
Ohhhh...
I look into your eyes
Ohhhh...
Best years of our lives

My world's a better place
'Cause I know you're mine
This love is so real
And it's no surprise

Come on and say, "Yeah"
I got a song
Yeah.. C'mon
'Cause through the years
I'll be right by your side

Ohhhh...
Makes me wanna dance
Ohhhh...
It's a new romance
Ohhhh...
I look into your eyes
Ohhhh...
Best years of our lives

See, you always consider me
Like a ogre, ugly duckling
And treat me
Like a Notradamus
Is why I had to get my shine on
You give me somethin to keep my mind on
Cuz you had my mind on

Aa-aa, aa-aa, aa-aa
Turn the lights on
Come on baby
Let's just rewind the song
'Cause all I wanna do is make
The rest years the best years
All night long

Ohhhh...
Makes me wanna dance
Ohhhh...
It's a new romance
Ohhhh...
I look into your eyes
Ohhhh...
Best years of our lives

Ohhhh...
Makes me wanna dance
Ohhhh...
It's a new romance
Ohhhh...
I look into your eyes
Ohhhh...
Best years of our lives
