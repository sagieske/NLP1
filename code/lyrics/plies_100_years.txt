Song:

[Intro:]
My n***a e'erytime I think this s**t gettin' rough out here
For me my n***a... I just remind myself dog Monday through
Friday homie... From 8 in the mornin' to 5 in the evenin'
Dog... It's some n****s in the court room 'round the country
My n***a... Fightin' for they muhfuckin' lives dog... The
Crackers bannin' n****s e'eryday my n***a

[Verse:]
My dog went to court today they gave him fifteen
Cracker banned my lil' n***a he was se'enteen
Young n***a don't even know what all that time mean
P***y a** crackers done shattered my n***a dreams
They holl'in' mandatory they want him to do the whole thang
N***a showed up in court on my dog and did his thang
N***a did my n***a now I got to bust his brain
N***a woulda did me my dog'd do the same
His lady callin' me cryin' and now I feel her pain
Tired of losin' all my n****s to the chain gang
In thirty minutes a n***a whole life can change
Cracker over sentencing n****s when this s**t gon' change?

[Chorus:]
P***y a** cracker give a n***a a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love the air n***a breathin' for real
Take a n***a life from him they don't know how it feel
P***y a** cracker give a n***a a hundred years
Have ya mama leavin' out the courtroom in tears
Crackers don't love the air n***a breathin' for real
Take a n***a life from him they don't know how it feel

[Verse 2:]
Ain't talked to my dog yet but I know he sick
Next fifteen years of his life behind a fence
Cracker find a n***a guilty and hit him wit' the bench
Gave one of my dogs twenty-seven on his first offense
The time they givin' the n***a for the crime ain't makin' sense
They jacked the number up now it's eighty-five percent
They did that to make you f**k n****s out there snitch
And put conspiracy in the game to railroad the click
And crackers feel like n****s ain't got no common sense
A n***a paper ain't right they banned off the rip
A public defender don't get you s**t but a long trip
And judge sentencin innocent n****s without a guilt

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
How in the f**k can fo' birds get you a life sentence?
But give a cracker seven years for money launderin' millions
Shoot a n***a in the leg they sentence you like you killed 'em
Cracker catch you wit' that iron and put you under the buildin'
You a n***a that mean you guilty 'til proven innocent
Money talk and bullshit walk a thousand miles
You ain't got a paid lawyer then don't go to trial
Crackers owe each other favors, they'll swap ya out
"You give us him, we'll give you him" know what I'm talkin' 'bout
N***a took thirty years on a cop out
F**k you get thirty years for breakin' in a b***h house?
Crackers playin' a dirty game boy this s**t wild

[Chorus:]
