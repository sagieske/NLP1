Song:

(To Clara)
What, that chile ain`t asleep yet? Give him to me.
I`ll fix him for you.
(Jake takes the baby from Clara)

Lissen to yo` daddy warn you,
`Fore you start a-travelling,
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you,
But a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

Yo` mammy is the first to name you,
Then she`ll tie you to her apron string,
Then she`ll shame you and she`ll blame you
Till yo` woman comes to claim you,
`Cause a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

Don`t you never let a woman grieve you
Just 'cause she got yo` weddin` ring.
She`ll love you and deceive you,
Take yo` clothes and leave you
`Cause a woman is a sometime thing.

Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

There now, what I tells you; he`s asleep already.
