Song:

Tell the swine
We will make it out alive
There's a note in the pages of the book
So Sleep tonight,
We'll sleep dreamlessly this time
When we awake we'll know that everything's alright

And sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you

Hold on to what we all remember fighting for,
There's some strength left in us yet
Hold on to what we all remember dying for,
There's some hope left in it yet

The show on your face, and your razor blades
The twilight is bruised and there you lie

And sing to me, about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you
We'll cry tonight, but in the morning we are new
Stand in the sun, we'll dry your eyes

Hold on to what we all remember fighting for,
There's some strength left in us yet
Hold on to what we all remember dying for,
There's some hope left in it yet

And sing
Sing
Arise

Arise and be,
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

Arise and be,
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

Arise and be,
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

Arise and be,
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed
