Song:

Everything goes on late here
Me and Sally Brown
Sitting back in a Cadillac
Ain't got no worries at
Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
Watching my baby
Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
Bourbon Street
Watching my baby
Well, you get on famous
Me and Jenny Brown
Smoking and talking there
I'm so glad I'm on
Bourbon Street...
All the people smoke outside
Everything is keeping high
Come see me, hey, I got the best
Is one enough fly to the west
And now I know the difference
Of me and Johnny's hands
Me and moma peanut butter
Get your head in your bed
Bourbon Street...
All the people...
