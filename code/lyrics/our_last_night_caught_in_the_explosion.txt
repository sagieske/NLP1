Song:

Were these words on time
Is there anything or anyone that should know that you are
Failing on my time

You can't believe that these notions are what's holding me back
And these memories have broken down and crashed into the sun

And all i could do is recite these lines
Over and over until these nights have left me

And if these stars up in this sky could fall
I wouldn't mind if you were caught in the explosion

Those reds and oranges would be the colors of my celebration

I never thought it'd be the same without you
