Song:

Quarter million dollar cash in my guest room
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check
Count a cool 2 mill without breaking sweats
Hit some more ain’t f*****g flexin, waynebo rolex
Bricksquad monopoly, hey that’s the company
Run that s**t the f**k back a track
These n****s playing man we cop it
Sour top dog, we in this b***h man

[Hook:]
I’m rocking rollies, I’m talking 3 of those
Bad b*****s, I got plenty of those
Diamond grill, I came through the ghost
I’m riding 6’s, I can do the 4’s
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Thumbing through them bands, I be playing with the checks
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set, squad!

Quarter million dollar cash in my guest room
Thumbing through the bands I be playing with a check
Count a cool 2 mill without breaking sweats
Hit some more ain’t f*****g flexin, waynebo rolex

Jiggin through this work, I don’t have to benchpress
When they kinda worry, my dogs always love to flex
Cause he be a stone cold killa with the pistol
Run up in my …how’s your mama gonna miss you
Stay about my grizzle, thumbing through a check
Stay a real n***a, I’ma put it on my set
Fell in love with fashion, since Gucci Corvette
N***a disrespect me, I just leave his a** wet

[Hook:]
I’m rocking rollies, I’m talking 3 of those
Bad b*****s, I got plenty of those
Diamond grill, I came through the ghost
I’m riding 6’s, I can do the 4’s
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Thumbing through them bands, I be playing with the checks
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set, squad!

He ain’t never been scared, threw a hunned on his head
Cash, bad, bad, stay real…
If I catch you slippin with my gun, black mask
I’m always fuckin hanging with no hobbies
Thumbing through the bands, I be doing that
You know I’m real n***a b***h break your f*****g back
You a p***y n***a, you don’t want no get back
I got war, girls back, had to live with that
Same situation get it how you live b***h
Worth a couple comments, you ain’t even average
I’m flexin with d7,
Free my n***a boosie, I’m a fuckin savage

[Hook:]
I’m rocking rollies, I’m talking 3 of those
Bad b*****s, I got plenty of those
Diamond grill, I came through the ghost
I’m riding 6’s, I can do the 4’s
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set
Thumbing through them bands, I be playing with the checks
Keep it real till I die, put it on my set, squad!
