LUMIERE

Ma chere, Mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents - your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the gray stuff
It's delicious!

Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!
They can sing, they can dance
After all, Miss, this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!

LUMIERE AND CHORUS

Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding "en flambe"

LUMIERE

We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes!
I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks

CHORUS

And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

LUMIERE

If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest!

LUMIERE

Life it so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ahh those good ol' days when we were useful
Suddenly those good ol' days are gone
10 years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skill
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy you walked in and oopsie daisy

MRS. POTTS

It's a guest! It's a guest!
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed

CHORUS

We've got a lot to do!

MRS. POTTS

Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest!

CHORUS

She's our guest!

MRS. POTTS

She's our guest!

CHORUS

She's our guest!
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Be our guest!


CHORUS

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Our command is your request
It's been years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you,
We'll keep going
Course by course, one by one
'Til you shout, "Enough! I'm done!"
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest! Be our guest!
Be our guest!
Please, be our guest!
