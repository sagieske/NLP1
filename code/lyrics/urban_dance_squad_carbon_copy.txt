Song:

Wish and stay green like the hornet
Keep kickin' like kato
Wish my middlefinger never pointed
To those who always act so-so
Insane to drain out the character
Muteness gets a rendez-vous
Got the extra curricula
I don't envy you
They try to suck me into their dream
Their tactics is a smokescreen
But it's all clear to me

Don't wanna be a carbon copy

It's attitude actin' up, gratitude crackin' up
Atiitude actin' up, gratitude

I wanna go high, but think low
Wanna go low and get real high
Question versus answer
Never refrain the wonder and why
Do or die, when the price is high
Heard a sigh, well at least he tries !
Pedestrians all step aside
Let your life
Pass you by

They try to suck you into their dream
Their tactics is a smokescreen
But it's all clear to me

Don't wanna be a carbon copy
