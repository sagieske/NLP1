Song:

Whispers in the grass,
Under slow dancing trees
Birds you're telling me stories
Seeing you were meant for me

With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet melodies
Can't go back or can't go on
Bittersweet melodies

We can... For, snow sleeps under the door
Time is... Cause we singing
Telephone always ringing

With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet memories
Can't go back or can't go on
Bad memories
From tip to toes
Just when the feeling's well
I'm bound
When still could...
Ends in our hearts

With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet melody
Bittersweet memories
Can't go back or can't go on
Both... Singing that same old song
With those bittersweet melodies
Like a sweet memory
Bittersweet memories
And it seems all so wrong
Since those bittersweet melodies play for me
