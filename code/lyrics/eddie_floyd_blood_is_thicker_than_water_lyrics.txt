Song:

Oh yeah

I know blood is thicker than water
But who you gonna satisfy?
I know in your mother's eye
You're the only baby child
(Baby child, baby child)

I know blood is thicker than water
But I just can't come and see
If you let your family stand between you and me
(You and me, you and me)

'Cause I love you and you love me
That's the way it's supposed to be
Tell your folks to leave us alone
Get your things, come on home

I know blood is thicker than water
But who you gonna satisfy, oh?
Oh yeah

I know blood is thicker than water
But who you gonna satisfy, girl?
I know in your mama's eye
You're the only baby child
(Baby child, baby child)

I know blood is thicker than water
I just had to come and see
If you let your family stand between you and me
(You and me, you and me)

You see, I need you, you need me
We can't live off the family tree
Tell your folks to leave us alone
Get your things and come on home

Oh, baby
(I know blood is thicker than water but who you gonna satisfy?)
And satisfy me love
On the bay, yes I am
(I know blood is thicker than water but who you gonna satisfy?)
Honey, I just love you

Would you like to answer this?
(I know blood is thicker than water)
Who you gonna satisfy, darling
When the moon is shining bright, yeah

Oh baby
(I know blood is thicker than water)
Who you gonna satisfy now, yeah?
(I know blood is thicker than water)
