Song:

He was working at the record shop,
I would kiss him in the parking lot,
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop,
Seventeen.

He would tell me I was beautiful,
Sneaking in the neighbours swimming pool,
Yeah, he'd tell me how to break the rules,
Seventeen.

But hey, those days are long gone,
But when I hear this song,
It takes me back.

We were on top of the world,
Back when I was your girl,
We were living so wild and free.
Acting stupid for fun,
All we needed was love,
That's the way it's supposed to be,
Seventeen.

Stealing beers out of the trailer park,
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark,
My favourite place was sitting in this car,
Seventeen.

We laid a blanket on the rooftop,
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop,
The nights were cold but we kept them hot,
Seventeen.

But hey, those days are long gone,
And when I hear this song,
It takes me back.

We were on top of the world,
Back when I was your girl,
We were living so wild and free.
Acting stupid for fun,
All we needed was love,
That's the way it's supposed to be.

We were running red lights,
We were going all night,
Didn't care about anything,
We were living the dream,
Baby you and me,
We were seventeen.

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhhh

I remember what it felt like,
Just a small town kinda life,
If only I could just go back in time,
Seventeen.

We were on top of the world,
Back when I was your girl,
We were living so wild and free,
Acting stupid for fun,
All we needed was love,
That's the way it's supposed to be.

We were running red lights,
We were going all night,
Didn't care about anything.
We were living the dream,
Baby you and me,
Cause we were seventeen.

Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen.
