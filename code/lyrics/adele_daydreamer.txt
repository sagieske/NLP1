Song:

Daydreamer, sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun he is a real lover,
Making up the past
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt her figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he when he walks,
He is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase,
But good to catch
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back,
Oh
You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I'll say this, just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
