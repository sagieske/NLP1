Song:

[Yoochun]
I can show you the world
Shining shimmering splendid,
Tell me princess now
When did you last let your heart decide

[Yunho]
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

[Jaejoong]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Junsu]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now from way up here
Its crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

[Changmin]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feelings
Soaring, tumbling, free-wheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[Jaejoong]
A whole new world
A hundred thousand things to see
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[Junsu]
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Jaejoong]
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[Junsu]
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Anywhere there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[Jaejoong]
A whole new world
[Micky]
A whole new world
[Jaejoong]
That's where we will be
[Yunho]
Where we will be
[Jaejoong + Junsu]
A thrilling chase
[Changmin]
A wondrous place
[Jaejoong + Junsu]
For you and me..
