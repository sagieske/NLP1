Song:

(Ashanti) [Ja talking]
Always there when you call [Buckshots, hah], always on time
Gave you my.... Baby be mine
Always there when you call (call), always on time
Gave you my.... Baby

(Chorus - Ashanti)
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

(Ja Rule)
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing d**k like no other (shit)
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby you know the name and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our s** life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
****And I love to see that a** and b***s shake
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids****
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin your a** and fuckin you all wild
[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare, but who cares, you care, babe

[Chorus:]

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
B***h, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over b*****s, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
*Aint more n***a in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care, babe

[Chorus:]

Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I f**k you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these b*****s to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
[With Ashanti] But who cares, you care, babe

[Chorus:]

(Ashanti)

Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my.... Baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my... Baby be mine
