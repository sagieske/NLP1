Song:

(Steve Karliski)
Their eyes were upon me as they sat they're drinking
Their hands reach up for you with lust in their hearts
As you dance away I know just what they're thinking
As I watch them watch you it just tears me apart.
Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.
--- Instrumental ---
Your eyes fall out at them and the crowd all goes wild
To them you're just a woman to go with their wine
I look at you and all I can see is a child
Hating the world makes you old before your time.
Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.
Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.
