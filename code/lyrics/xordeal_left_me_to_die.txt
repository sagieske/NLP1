Song:

How could things run out of control so quick and unforeseen?
We lost ourselves in a personal war, an unnecessary ridiculousity
All my attempts to reach you were bound to fail
I raised no accusations because I always thought:
"What you didn't know when you said goodbye
Was that you left me to die"
You never saw my pain, the tears that I cried
You never heard me scream in the black of the night
You never understood my thoughts
You never made me feel human
I saw myself decay
Helplessly drowning deeper
I feasted myself at my agony
Growing my hate stronger because
Perhaps you knew when you said goodbye
That you left me to die
Now that I gained some insight
To the corrupted soul of yours
The only feeling I feel
Is eternal hate for you
Your heartlessness is disgusting
Can you still look in the mirror? - I doubt
But you keep telling me 'bout moral
You, a monster without a conscience
Now I'm sure when you said goodbye
You knew you left me to die
