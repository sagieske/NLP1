Song:

Feel like I've been waiting so long for tonight,
Cause I just can't get you out of my mind...
Can you feel my heart's beating so fast,
Now your here no there's no turning back...

Oh I think I'm falling, Can't hold on no more...
Enough is enough, enough is enough, just gotta let
Go...
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine,
No I never felt, never felt like this before...

Come on babe, don't give up on us...
Choose me andя I'll show you love...
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love!

If you cry I'll be there at your side,
If your lost I'll be there shining my light...
Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars,
Cause nothing could ever keep us apart...

Oh I think I'm falling, can't hold on no more...
Enough is enough, enough is enough, just gotta letя
Go...
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine,
No I never felt never felt like this before...
Come on babe, don't give up on us...

Choose me and I'll show you love...
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love,
Let me show you love!
