Song:

Get your shoes on, get your suitcase, your stereo and all your cds
No more talking, just start walking, 'cause all that's left for you to do is leave
Tell your lawyer it's all over, forget what he's got up his sleeve
No more signing, no more whining, 'cause all that's left for you to do is leave

[Chorus:]
All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

Leave the dog here, he don't like you and we'll go walking anytime we please
Leave the cat here, leave my hat here, 'cause all that's left for you to do is leave
I'll keep the diamond on my finger and you'll keep the bitter memories
Leave the dishes, no more kisses, 'cause all that's left for you to do is leave

[Chorus:]
All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

[Chorus:]
All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave
