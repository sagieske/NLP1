Song:

I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Many, many dreams, hard dreams and rough dreams to remember

I saw you there last night
Another man's arms held you tight
I don't know how I felt inside
All I know is I walked away and cried

I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Many, many dreams, hard dreams and rough dreams to remember

I know you said he was just a friend
But I saw you kiss him again and again
These eyes are mine, they don't fool me
Why did you hold him so tenderly?

I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, hard dreams and rough dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway, yeah
Oh, don't, don't you ever leave
Oh, come on baby, don't you know you satisfy me

I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
Many, many dreams

I've got dreams to remember
Many, many dreams, hard dreams and rough dreams to remember

I still want you to stay
I still love you anyway, yeah
Oh, don't you ever, ever leave me
Don't you know that you satisfy me

And I've got dreams, dreams to remember
I've got dreams, dreams to remember
