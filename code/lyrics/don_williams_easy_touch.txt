Song:

I'm an easy touch she knows it everybody does
I just can't say no she calls I go
And I would bring her the world on a silver platter
Oh but things like that don't matter
All she wants is all my love and for that I'm an easy touch
I'm an easy touch I love her she don't know how much
I just can't resist she wants she gets
And I would gladly pay any price to be with her
Oh there's nothing I wouldn't give her
All she wants is all my love and for that I'm an easy touch

I just love to hear her say honey there's something I need today
It's so sure a sign that love is on the way
[ strings ]
And I would gladly pay any price...
