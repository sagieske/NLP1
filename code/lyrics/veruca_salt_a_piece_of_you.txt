Song:

I'm just trying to live this life of mine
The more I look, the more I'm blind
And all I ask for is piece of mind
And all I want is a piece of you

Well I lost my way today
Back home from work
The snow fell like dust
I felt like dirt
Happens everytime I start to search
For that long lost piece of you

A piece of you
A piece of you
A piece of you

It seems the last time I was sure
Of anything
I sold my heart
I wore your ring
But now, the queen has lost her king
All I want is a piece of you

A piece of you
A piece of you
A piece of you
