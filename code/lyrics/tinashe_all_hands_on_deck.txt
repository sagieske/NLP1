Song:

[Hook:]
All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'ma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'ma blow your mind like that

[Verse:]
Wasted hard
When you left me, you left me with no choice
I'm looking for a boy to fill this empty void
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh
Wasted hard
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh

[Hook:]
(X2)

[Verse 2:]
Wasted hard
. Use to death do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners,. And destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch em go down, watch em fall like dominoes
Watch em go down, watch em go down, watch em go down

[Hook:]
[Verse 3:]
And you know that I tried
Really gave my all
Everything we built
Baby you let it fall, you let it fall
And now you want me
Want me back now
And the thing that's so funny
Is baby I'm long gone, I'm long gone

[Hook:]
(X2)
