Song:

Yeah
Yeayeah

Next thing I knew we were in deep
Hold on to me, cause babe I'm bout to leave
She said it never felt so right
As the time went by
And I was off in the night
She said I don't cry, tonight I cried twice
The thought of you not by my side
And I find you the on the emotional type
Hold on to me, we can hold on for life
Tell me how you feel when I say this,
Our destination is place-less
I never understood what it meant when
I said the three words that some people dread
That's about as real as it gets
I never hold back with my love and intent
Finally figured out what it meant
Now there's a spark in my heart times ten

Everyday
Eight days a week was the song that I'd play
Eight times for me and eight times for the sake
Eight times for love and eight times for the way
That I can remember those days
You and every minute wasn't all so strange
See you in the spring when the patience pays
I'm strugglin' but hustlin' and lovin' it, always.

Yeah yeah

I wrote to her eighty-five times
Sometimes for her, but sometimes for my
Simple collection of lies
Sometimes to find the way up in a rhyme
I woke up one morning to find
It was her first name on a billboard sign
I smiled and said damn what a trip
I was just yesterday I had a kiss for her lips
Usually I don't make much of this
A sign's a sign it doesn't change it a bit
I choose to stay calm in my sleep
Seeing the prize on April nineteenth
That was then, I was down to a week
Longest seven days of my life so to speak
I sip up my tea so sweet
And my head thirsts the girl I've been dying to see

So, everyday
Eight days a week was the song that I'd play
Eight times for me and eight times for the sake
Eight times for love and eight times for the way
That I can remember those days
You and every minute wasn't all so strange
See you in the spring when the patience pays
I'm strugglin' but hustlin' and lovin' it, always.
