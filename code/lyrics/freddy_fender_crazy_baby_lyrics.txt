Song:

The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I can't find my baby
I wonder she left town

Rain rain rain rain
I'd like to see my girl again
She broke my heart in two
And caused me so much pain

Rain rain rain rain
My pillow's soaking wet
I can't find her in the morning
She's not home yet

(Repeat)

The rain keeps falling
Tears keep coming down
I couldn't find my darling
I wonder she left town

Rain rain rain rain
My pillow's soaking wet
Where is she in the morning
She's not home yet

Rain rain rain rain
Rain rain rain rain
Rain rain rain rain
