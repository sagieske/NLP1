Song:

I've been thinkin' 'bout us
(and the things we've been through)
It's time we get serious
(you know I would like to)
But we need to work out these issues
Before they get out of hand

(oh Yeah) Oh yeah
I know we've been fussing and arguing
But the fact is unity is a good thing
It took a while for me but now I see
Though some will love you, that same will hate you
Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
Just try to chill and ride it out
But it's official when I'm against you
Whether it's wrong or it's right
I would rather be by your side (x4)

I've been lookin' at our history
Things ain't changin' but they need to be
Where do we start
Seems like it's gone too far
Can't we just try to work it out

(oh yeah) Oh yeah
I know we've been fussing and arguing
But the truth is unity is a good thing
It took some time for me but now I see
Though some will love you, that same will hate you
Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
So try to chill and ride it out
But it's official when I'm against you
Whether it's wrong or it's right
I would rather be by your side (x4)

I'm so sorry I treated you so bad (so bad)
But I did realize what a friend I had (oh no)
I regret the things I did and you can't believe that
I apologize
Wish I could take it back

Though some will love you (kiley: sometimes I loved you), that same will hate you
Sometimes I'll scream and curse you out
So try to chill and ride it out
But it's official when I'm against you (oh)
Whether it's wrong or it's right
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side (by your side, yeah)
I would rather be by your side (by your side)
I would rather be by your side (side)
I would rather be by your side (oh)
I would rather be by your side (oooh)
I would rather be by your side
I would rather be by your side
