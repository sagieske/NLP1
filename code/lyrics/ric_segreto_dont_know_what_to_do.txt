Song:

I have loved you only in my mind
But I know that there will come a time
To feel this feeling I have inside
You're a hopeless romantic is what they say
Falling in and out of love just like a play
Memorizing each line, I still don't know what to say
What to say...
Don't know what to do whenever you are near
Don't know what to say, my heart is floating in tears
When you pass by I could fly
Every minute, every second of the day
I dream of you in the most special way
You're beside me all the time
All the time...

I have loved you and I always will
Call it crazy but I know someday you'll feel
This feeling I have for you inside
I'm a hopeless romantic I know I am
Memorized all the lines and here I am
Struggling for words I still don't know what to say
What to say...

Don't know what to do whenever you are near
Don't know what to say, my heart is floating in tears
When you pass by I could fly
Every minute, every second of the day
I dream of you in the most special way
You're beside me all the time
All the time... all the time... all the time...
