Song:

As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord (oh yes)
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
We have counted the cost
We have made a choice
We will follow our God
And obey His word
From this day and
For the rest of our lives
We will serve the Lord
(Repeat)
[Bridge:]
We will not bow to another God
We will have no other gods but You
We will not serve two masters
We surrender our lives to You
We surrender our lives to You
(Repeat chorus 2x)
[Bridge:]
