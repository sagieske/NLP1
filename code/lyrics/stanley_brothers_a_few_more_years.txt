Song:

A few more years shall roll, a few more seasons shall come
Then we shall be with those at rest asleep within the tomb

Then Oh my Lord prepare my soul for that great day
Wash me in Thy precious blood and take my sins all away

A few more meetings here shall cheer us on our way
And we shall reach that endless rest on that eternal day
