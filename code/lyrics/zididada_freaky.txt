You tell me that you want me
To be your man
But I am twotimer baby
Forget about the things
You do for me
Cause I am a twotimer baby.

You say you wanna be with me
But baby I am to freaky-e
I really think you wanna stay away from me
Cause baby it ain't hard to see

I am freaky freaky freaky freaky yeaahh

I'd love to have a night
On the town with you
But a twotimer baby
Be carefull if yoy want me
To be your fun cause
I am a twotimer baby

I know you wanna be....

I am freaky....
