Song:

I am through with you
Baby, I refuse to be blue

Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat

Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)

Shame, shame on me
For thinking that I could possibly be
The exclusive one of your choice
In this world infested with boys

Well, now I know that I am first on your list
And if I leave, I'm gonna be missed
I cannot take a chance on you
It's so easy to become number two

And I refuse to be blue
Baby, I'm crying you will lose

Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat

Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)

Let you see how does it feel
(Let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real
(To be un-for-real)

To be without a love of your own
(Without a love of your own)
And all your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)

So good, I had known that your love was good
But it don't rectify how I'll cry
If you ever say goodbye

I refuse to be blue
Meaning, I'm cutting you a-loose

Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat
Let hurt put you in the loser's seat

Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)
Let hurt put you behind the wheel
(Hurt put you in the loser's seat)

Let you see how it feels
(Let you see how it feels)
To be un-for-real
(To be un-for-real)
To be without a love of your own
(Without a love of your own)

And all your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)
All your goodies are gone
(All your goodies are gone)

All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone

All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
All your goodies are gone
