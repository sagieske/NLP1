Song:

It’s bargain day
Wanna buy a heart?
It’s bargain day
Mine is torn apart

I’ll sell it cheap
Or maybe I could trade it in
On a happier model

It’s bargain day
Here’s a pair of arms
It’s bargain day
Gone are all their charms

They need somebody bad
To put themselves around
Where can he be found?

Here we have a pair of eyes
A little of dry of tears
A little bleak
And here we have a pair of eyes
You’ll have to bend an ear
Their words are week

But it’s bargain day
You can name your price
On bargain day
Think about it twice

For you might take these items
Torn with pain and strife
And maybe someday
You could bring them back to life

It’s bargain day
Wanna buy a heart
It’s bargain day
Mine is torn apart

I’ll sell it cheap
Or maybe I could trade it in
