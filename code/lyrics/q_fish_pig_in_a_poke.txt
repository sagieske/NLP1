Song:

Female - and 22 years old
Long hair - very good lookin'

I'm searchin' for you -your age is till 30

Just send me a letter
Box 6980

I wrote her - and she gimme a call
We've made a date (for today) - in Rics American cafe.

Who'll come through the door -
With this rose in her hand?

Will she fit my dreams -or will I hide my face?

Ref.:
But I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke
I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke

Perhaps she's rad!
Good lookin' to me.
Breasts like the moon -And hungry like me

But what about -(If) she's as ugly as sin?

3rd
A few weeks on - we're still together
But all she wants - is just to kiss me.

I've asked her for more -
But she always refuse me.

"No sex" she cries -
Before we get married.

Ref.:
But I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke
I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke

Perhaps she's rad!
Good lookin' to me.
Breasts like the moon -And hungry like me

But what about -(If) she's as ugly as sin?

No-I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke!!!
I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke!!!

Solo

Ref. X2:
But I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke
I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke

Perhaps she's rad!
Good lookin' to me.
Breasts like the moon -And hungry like me

But what about -(If) she's as ugly as sin?

No - I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke!!!
I don't wanna buy the pig in a poke!!!

But I always always always do...
