Song:

I'm a bad man... Given bad men... Bad looks.
Prince among thieves and crooks.
Want bad women, bad cars, bad runs, bad dudes... I'm makin my own rules.
I'm a bad man... Given bad men... Bad looks.
Prince among thieves and crooks.
I want bad women, bad cars, bad runs, bad dudes... I'm makin my own rules... I'm a bad man.

Shhhhh..... Got to sleep now...
To wake up... To trouble.

I'm a bad man... Bad men... Bad looks.
A prince amongst these murderers and crooks.
Juvenile from a good kid... One f****d up fellony wait for my life big.
If I was born blind, being daddy such the child.
Damn I was born to be wow... Ain't nobody gonna stop me.
I want it all till God shut my eyes and they bury my body.

It's almost over... Run.
I'm talkin to you... Ya'll want nothin with me.

All day, all night front of the store, my daddy's format.
Tussle on this corner, hussle on this corner.
Killa's ran in his house, tied his spouse.
Cocked the ammo back and the little boys mouth...
Been f****d up ever since... Scared murderer.
Brought me and bust me a gun ever since.
Roam the streets, no love... The streets... The streets changed me.

I'm a bad man... Given bad men... Bad looks.
Prince among thieves and crooks.
Want bad women, bad cars, bad runs, bad dudes... I'm makin my own rules.
I'm a bad man... Given bad men... Bad looks.
Prince among thieves and crooks.
I want bad women, bad cars, bad runs, bad dudes... I'm makin my own rules... I'm a bad man.

Want ya'll to follow me... Know where to go... Know where to hide.
Hahaha... Spell it all at em.... Spell it all at em and hollar.

I'm a bad bad bad man.... Watch out.... I'm a bad bad man.

Go to sleep now... Like this part... You know where to find me.
