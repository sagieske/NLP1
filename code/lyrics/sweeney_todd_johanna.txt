Song:

Anthony:
I feel you Johanna
I feel you
Do they think that walls can hide you?
Even now I'm at you window
I am in the dark beside you
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
And are you beautiful and pale,
With yellow hair,
Like her?
I'd want you beautiful and pale
The way I've dreamed you were
Johanna

Anthony:
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
And if you're beautiful, what then,
With yellow hair,
Like wheat?
I think we shall not meet again
My little dove
My sweet
Johanna

Anthony:
I'll steal you
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
Good-bye Johanna
You're gone and yet you're mine
I'm fine Johanna
I'm fine

Anthony:
Johanna

Beggar Woman:
Smoke!
Smoke!
Sign of the Devil!
Sign of the Devil!
C'iy on fire!
Witch!
A witch!
Smell that Sir?
An evil smell!
Ev'ry night at the Vesper's Bell!
Smoke that comes from the mouth of Hell!
C'iy on fire!
C'iy on fire!
Mischief!
Mischief!
Mischief!

Sweeney Todd:
And if I never hear your voice,
My turtledove,
My dear
I still have reason to rejoyce,
The way ahead is clear
Johanna

Anthony (same time as Mr. Todd [below]):
I feel you
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
And in the darkness
When I'm blind with what I can't forget
It's always morning in my mind
My little lamb
My pet
Johanna
You stay Johanna
(Anthony: Johanna)
The way I've dreamed you are
Oh look Johanna
A star
(Anthony: Buried sweetly in your yellow hair)
A shooting star

Beggar Woman:
There!
There!
Somebody!
Somebody!
Look up there!
Didn't I tell you?
Smell that air!
C'iy on fire!
Quick! Sir!
Run and tell!
More and more like a witch's spell!
There it is!
There it is!
The unholy smell!
Tell it to the Beadle, and police as well!
Tell 'em!
Tell 'em!
Help!
Please!
C'iy on fire!
C'it on fire!
Mischief!
Mischief!

Sweeney Todd:
And though I'll think of you, I guess
Until the day I die
I think I miss you less and less
As everyday goes by
Johanna

Anthony:
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her
If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were
Johanna

Anthony:
I feel you
Johanna

Sweeney Todd:
Wake up,
Johanna
Another bright red day
We learn Johanna
To say
Good-bye

Anthony:
I'll steal you
