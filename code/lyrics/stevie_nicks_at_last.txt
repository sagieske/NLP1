Song:

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days over
And life is like a song


At last
The skies above are blue
Well my heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill
To press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Well

You smile
You smile
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream
That I could speak to
A dream that I
Could call my own
I found a thrill
To press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Well

You smile
You smile
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

Ooo yea
You are mine
You are mine
At last
At last
At last
At last
