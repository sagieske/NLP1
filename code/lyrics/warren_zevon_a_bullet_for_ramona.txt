Oh, today I shot Ramona, Ma
She ain't gonna cheat on me
Two years, I've been searchin' for her
Two years, she's been free

Well, I found her in a dance hall in Laredo
And she told me that she wanted only me
And I held her in my arms the way I used to
But when morning came she begged me to set her free

Oh, today I shot Ramona, Ma
She ain't gonna cheat on me
Two years, I've been searchin' for her
Two years, she's been free

Well. I tried and tried to ride away and leave her
With my head hung low, teardrops filled my eye
I rode back to town and found her with a drifter
And I knew right then Ramona had to die

Oh, today I shot Ramona, Ma
She ain't gonna cheat on me
Two years, I've been searchin' for her
Two years, she's been free

Well, I'm writing you this letter from Laredo
And tonight I'll ride across the Rio Grande
If I never live to see another sunrise
You know, I loved her
Ma, I hope you understand

Oh, today I shot Ramona, Ma
She ain't gonna cheat on me
Two years, I've been searchin' for her
Two years, she's been free

Oh, today I shot Ramona, Ma
She ain't gonna cheat on me
Two years, I've been searchin' for her
Two years, she's been free
