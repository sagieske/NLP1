[Marv One]

Yo yo, y'all ready for death
Y'all ready for death
Marv One that fat killer the game done got ugly, lets go
Yo, yo, I seen your type before you think you tough, battle you
B***h you lucky I don't beat you up
In the game of fist ta cups I'll push your face back
You can't f**k with me man, really just face facts
As he verses me in a battle of ten rounds
Its like Mugsey Boags tryin to bark with Jim Brown
Dumb f**k, I'm the type to run a muck, come in the club drunk as f**k
Slap your b***h who even buck, when I walk.....
Tell your a man the size of a? D and D dof?
Tryin to take his ear off, like Mike Tyse,
I quite nice on fight nights, man why he poppin s**t
I thought he liked life, apparently not
I'm incoherently hot, and if I meant you
May your parents be shot
You I'm a bad boy, b***h is on, I pull 44's in your chest
Like your freak mahone

[B-Rabbit]

Hold on faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'm goin let you get away with that song
Cause that s**t was wack, you aint spittin
As a matter of fact all of that s**t was written,
And I no it wasn't for me, shorely, you really must adore me,
Now look it,
Yo, you might as well move to Italy
Look this guy is ripped (skkkrr) literally
You don't wanna really f**k wit this,
On this microphone, I aint Snuffalupagus
But I don't give a f**k, you can keep that dope rap
And turn your a** back around with your fuckin skull cap,
And your bandana or your mother fuckin sweat band
Fuckin with this style you're a dead man,
I aint redman but on this mic yo I pick it up,
Just like your face when I had to rip it up,
You don't wanna see me,
Yo, uh
