Song:

[Verse:]
Here's another morning without you,
Here's another day, will I get throught it
Without breaking down.
Haven't seen the sun since
You've been gone.
Like my heart I lost it
When you left me, and it can't be found.
How can I go on, baby
I've been living on memories of you and me.
All the love we made, all those tender nights
And those endless days, there all here inside, baby....
(chorus)can you stop the rain from falling,
Wont you chase my clouds away.
Id give anything to see the sun again.
Only you can stop these tears from falling,
I can't face another day,
Baby can you stop.
[Verse 2:]
Can you stop the rain.
Everywhere I go I feel you there,
Following my footsteps like a shadow
Of my broken heart.
Sometimes it's a pair of passing eyes
Or it's just the way someone is talking,
And there you are.
Am I all alone? Don't you ever wake up
And reach for me where I used to be.
Is there any chance? I just can't believe your not
Lonely too just for me and you, baby.
[Chorus:]
[Verse 3:]
If you were here for only one night
Baby I know you'd remember.
Cuz loving you once wasn't time enough
I know we can make it together, together.
Baby stop the rain, wont you chase my clouds away
Id give anything to see the sun again.
Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling,
I can't face another day, baby can you stop?
