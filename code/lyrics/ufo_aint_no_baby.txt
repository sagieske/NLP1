Song:

Hey there now big shot well just listen to me
I know the score and it's no great mystery
I hear you talking and it's all been said
But what I'm thinking I keep inside my head
* I ain't no baby, so get out of my way
Keep in with your own kind
Ain't none of your business, you got nothing to say
Stay away, forever
You play the cool star it's a dangerous game
Don't forget the street and who gave you your name
Romancin' with the company as they pour in the pounds
If the next thing is you and then who are the clowns?
* chorus
--instrumental--
* chorus
Stay away, forever
