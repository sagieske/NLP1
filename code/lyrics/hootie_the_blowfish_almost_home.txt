Song:

(the reivers)

Walking on the water in a van
Tryin to think of everything I can
But it's getting very late,
And these tapes don't sound too good
And my body just don't feel
The way I wish it would.

I was driving when I heard you call my name.
It was not like before not quite the same
It's too late to be much good and I might as well confess
That I have not got the nerve to borrow cigarettes.

When I'm almost with you music tries to play,
When I'm almost home I almost hear you say,
It would be all right if we could run away.

Deciding things for all my life
No one ever tells you when or why
But my heart can't seem to tell me
What would satisfy my mind
So I jump into the van one more time
