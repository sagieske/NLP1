Song:

Across the earth Your praises rise
We lift our voice, call upon Your Name
You gave us hope that never ends
In Christ alone the victory remains

For You are great and mighty
Let the nations sing

Your praise fills the heavens
For You have redeemed us
Our hope is in You alone

The cross has released us
To sing of Your freedom
By grace You make all things new

We lift You high
We lift You high

You came to us to save our lives
The love of God was seen upon the cross
You rose again, the glory Yours
The highest praise belongs to You alone, Jesus

For You are great and mighty
Let the nations sing

Your praise fills the heavens
For You have redeemed us
Our hope is in You alone

The cross has released us
To sing of Your freedom
By grace You make all things new

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Lord Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Lord Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all

Your kingdom reigns
Your kingdom reigns
Above all, above all
