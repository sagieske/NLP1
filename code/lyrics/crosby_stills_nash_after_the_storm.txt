Song:

After the clouds disappear
After the rainbow has gone
I'm left with a song in my ear
The melody is lingering on
How come I have to explain
Music is worth all the pain

After the rain washes down
After all the fog burns away
Will I see the sun coming 'round?
Closer and closer each day
How come I have to explain
People are worth all the pain
I just want to see the love in your eyes
After the storm has passed you and gone

When you're dreaming of how it can be
It doesn't work to pretend
Let me tell you what happened to me
Just to get to the end
I needed a friend
After the rainbow had gone
It's so sad, losing a friend
But the memories are lingering on

How come I have to explain
Children are worth all the pain

I just want to see the love in your eyes
After the storm has passed you and gone

I just want to see the love in your eyes
After the storm has passed you and gone
