Song:

I.
Here I am, standing close to you
And it's still so far away, 
So many times, I tried to say, 
But my heart was afraid

II.
Look at you is all that I can do, 
Like a silly girl, I stare
'Coz you might leave me when I reveal, 
What my heart is really feeling

CHORUS
If I could just say the words, 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you'll hear, 
Will you take me in your arms or let me go, 
Our lovely days will they just fade like whispers in the wind?

If I could just say the words, 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you'll hear, 
Can't you see the love I hide slip through my eyes, 
This silly girl so scared she just can't say "I Love you."

III.
Here I am, holding on to fate, 
What we have may never change
'Coz you might leave me when I reveal, 
My lips will seal the love I'm hiding.

(Repeat Chorus)

If I could just say the words, 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you'll hear, 
Can't you see the love I hide slip through my eyes, 
This silly girl so scared she just can't say "I Love you."
