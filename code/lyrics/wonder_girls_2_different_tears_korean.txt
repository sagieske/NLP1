Song:

Gave me two different tears, neo ttaemune nan
Gippeoseo ureogo seulpeoseo ureosseo
So I hate you, so I love you
So I hate you, so I love you

Nan neo eobshi saraga neunge wae ajikdo ireohke himdeunji
Deo isangbu eun nuneuro nuntteugin shilheo ijen ugo shipeo

Geuraeseo niga jun apeum saeng gakhae
Neo ttaemune heullin nunmul saeng gakhae
Geureonde wae jakkuman haeng bokhaeteon sungan man
Tteo ulligo ineunji moreugesseo

Gave me two different tears, neo ttaemune nan
Gippeoseo ureogo seulpeoseo ureosseo
So I hate you, but the love you gave me was so so good
So I love you, but the pain you gave me was so so bad

Wae ajikdo neo ttaeme nunmul heulli neunji naega neomu shilheo
Eolmana deo sang cheoreul ibeoya nan neoreul miwo halsu isseulkka

Geuraeseo niga jun apeum saeng gakhae
Neo ttaemune heullin nunmul saeng gakhae
Hajiman geureol surok mireo naeryeo halsurok
Ni moseubeun deo gakkai dagawa

Gave me two different tears, neo ttaemune nan
Gippeoseo ureogo seulpeoseo ureosseo
So I hate you, but the love you gave me was so so good
So I love you, but the pain you gave me was so so bad

Why do I still feel this way when I know there's nothing left to say
Charari molla sseumyeon joheul kkeol jiwo beorigo shipeo neol
Nae jashinege miwo harago neol giyeokhara go geu sang cheoreul
But, ah, that's the reason why I still miss you, no matter how hard I try

Gave me two different tears, neo ttaemune nan
Gippeoseo ureogo seulpeoseo ureosseo
So I hate you, but the love you gave me was so so good
So I love you, but the pain you gave me was so so bad

Gave me two different tears, neo ttaemune nan
Gippeoseo ureogo seulpeoseo ureosseo
So I hate you, but the love you gave me was so so good
So I love you, but the pain you gave me was so so bad
