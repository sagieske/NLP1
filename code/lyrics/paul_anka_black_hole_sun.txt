[Originally by Soundgarden]

In my eyes, indisposed
In disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake
In the sun in my disgrace

Boiling heat, summer stench
'Neath the black the skies look dead
Call my name, through the dream
And I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come, won't you come

Stuttering, cold and damp
Steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men
And sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, walking sleep
And my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send, hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun, won't you come
Wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come, won't you come
Black hole sun, won't you come
Wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come, won't you come

Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come
Wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come
Black hole sun, won't you come
Black hole sun, won't you come
