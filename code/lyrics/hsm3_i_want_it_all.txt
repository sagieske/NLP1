Song:

Imagine having everything we ever dreamed
Don't you want it?
Maybe
Can't you see it?
Kinda
Imagine first audition after college
I get the lead!
A part for me?
Well of course
Yeah right!
You gotta believe it
Keep talking
You and I all the fame
Sharpay and what's his name?
Sound exciting?
Inviting
Let's do it then
Listening
Personal stylist, agent and a publicist
But where do I fit into this?
With you we can win

Win a part
Think bigger!
Become superstars
That's better
Don't you see that bigger is better
And better is bigger
A little bit is never enough
No, No, No!

Don't you want it all!
You want it, you know that you want it
The fame and the fortune and more
You want it all, you want it, you know that you want it
You gotta have your star on the door
You want the world nothing less, all the glam and the press
Only giving you the best reviews.
Sing it!
I want it all
I want it, I want it, Yeah
My name in lights at Carnage Hall
I want it all!

Can't you see it
Yeah
They're gonna love me
Ahem
I mean us!
Red carpet, rose bouquets, crowd waiting back stage
I'm with her, don't stop me, I'm not the paparazzi
Invitations, standing ovations
Magazines
Yes please
Gonna be celebrities!
Photographs, fan clubs, give the people what they love
Now you're excited!
I like it
Let's do it then
Times Square, jet setters, sequels
Hey better
New York today, tomorrow the world!

Sold out shows
Think bigger
And the Oscar goes to...
That's better!

Don't you see that bigger is better and Better is bigger
A little bit is never enough!
No, No, No!

I want it all!
I want it, want it, Want it
The fame and the fortune... And more
I want it all
I want it, want it, Want it
I gotta have my star on the door
I want the world nothing less, all the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews.
I Want it all!
I want it, Want it, Want it, Radio, cd, Music Hall
We Want it all!

Here in the spotlight we shine, look at who we are

When Broadway knows your name,

You know that you're a star.!
Dance!

[Breakdown]
I want it, I-I I want it, I want it, I want it,
I-I, I want it, I want it, I want I-I I Want It!

I Want It All! I want it, want it, want it! (I want it all...)
The fame and the fortune and more!
I want it all! I want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door
I want the world nothing less, all the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews.
I want it all!
Paris!
