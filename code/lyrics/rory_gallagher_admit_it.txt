Song:

Admit it baby, you've gone and broke your word
Now ain't it crazy, I believed every word I've heard
Imagine baby, we were just like one
But that's it baby, I believe you've had your fun
I'm mad when I'm mad and I'm mad with you right now
I'm mad when I'm mad and I'm mad with you right now
Yeah, someone told me time and time again
To watch you closely, but I didn't heed a word they said
Now something matter, but I know in time
You'll go your way and walk right out of my mind
Who cooled your goose, who took the wind out of your sails?
Who cooled your goose, who took the wind out of your sails?
You blew it baby, now look what you've done
You made me fall down, now you wanna run
Supposin' baby, we had just now met
Well, I guess I'd fall again, so why should I have some regrets?
Just a fool for you baby, you know I just can't say no
Just a fool for you baby, you know I just can't say no
