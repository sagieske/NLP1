Song:

Yeeeaaaaahhhhh

Yeeeaaaaahhhhh

When the world slips you a Jeffery, 
Stroke the furry wall, 
Stroke the furry wall, 

Furry walls don't bring me down, 
Furry walls please stay around, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls kiss me to sleep, 
Furry walls please help me read, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls can take you on a magic carpet ride, 
Furry walls surround you till you got no place to hide, 
Let your furry fingers be your guide

Furry walls turn out the light, 
Furry walls please stay the night, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls let's have a date, 
Furry walls sit on my face, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above, 
All around are furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove, 
Let me stroke your furry walls of love, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls, I am amazed, 
Furry walls, we're in a daze, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Don't be in a hurry, things are not the way they were, 
Shaggy walls of loveliness, it's all a furry blur, 
Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above, 
All around are furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove, 
Let the walls caress you in a showering of love, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls, I'm gonna cry, 
Furry walls, please lift me high, 
Furry walls, 
Furry walls

Furry walls
Furry walls
Furry walls
