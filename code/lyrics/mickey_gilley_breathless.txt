Song:

If you love me then please don't tease
If I can hold then let me squeeze
My heart goes around and round
My love comes a tumblin' down
You leave me, breathtess.

Well, I shake all over and you know why
I am sure it's love honey that's no lie
'Cause when you call my name
You know I burn like a wooden flame
You leave me, breathless.

Ooohhh baby, crazy
Your much to much, I can't love you enough
Well now, It's alright to hold me tight
But when you love, me love me right.

Come on baby, now don't be sheigh
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, through the snow,
I'm gonna be where ever you go
You leave me, breathless.

Well ohhhh baby, crazy
Your much to much, I can't love you enough
Well, It's alright to hold me tight
But when you love, me love me right.

Come on baby, now don't be sheigh
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, through the snow,
I'm gonna be where ever you go
You leave me, breathless...
