Song:

(Mark Hollis)

Take my hand
Colours seem so black inside your head
Does everything reflect the time you spend
So tired of thinking you
You hide your face
Don't ask me to excuse

I'm only laughing
Again, a game... Again

Some things are right
I'm only laughing
Again, a game... Again

Save your words
Words they're never there for those who try
A stranger in a world no longer mine
Sometimes I'm feeling used
I'll change my place
I'd sooner be excused

You're only laughing
Again, a game... Again
I'm only laughing
Again, a game... Again

Some things are right
I'm only laughing
Again, a game... Again

There are times I confess
I'm not easy to accept
So come find I'll react
I'm a reason to be there
They're only laughing
Again, a game... Again

I'm only laughing
Again, a game... Again
