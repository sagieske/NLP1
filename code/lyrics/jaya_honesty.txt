Song:

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Chorus:
Honesty is such a lonely word
Ev'ryone is so untrue,
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve,
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
And all I want is someone to believe

Chorus:
Honesty is such a lonely word
Ev'ryone is so untrue,
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

Refrain:
I can find a lover
I can find a friend,
I can have security
Until the bitter end,
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again,
I know (I know), I know
Woh, woh

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerne
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Chorus:
Honesty is such a lonely word
Ev'ryone is so untrue,
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

Only you...
