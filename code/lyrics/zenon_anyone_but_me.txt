Song:

We never seem, to get along
You're always right, I'm never wrong
Wish that you could see, the way I see it

I say left, you say right
You say day, and I say night
You may have your dream, but I can't be it

Soooo, don't try to change me
Cause I'm not you

[Chorus:]
I walked a mile, in your shoes
Learned a lot I was amused
But I can't be, anyone but me
I can change, what I wear
Change the color of my hair
But I can't be, anyone but me

If you could try, to understand
You'd see who I really am
I just wanna make my own decisions
You try to make. Me someone else
But I've got to be myself
Don't wanna ask, for your permission

Soo, don't try to change me
Cause I'm not you

(repeat chorus)

Now that we've found a way to start
To be just who we are
It doesn't have to be so hard
Now that we've come so far
I'm proud of you, your proud of me
Together we will see
All the missing pieces in this wild, crazy mystery

(repeat chorus)
