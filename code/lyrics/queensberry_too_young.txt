Song:

What if I could turn back time tonight?
Play funny games with you
Like we used to
And you could say "It's gonna be alright"

But these days are gone
I never forget it
'Cause I have the time of my life

Oh maybe we were just too young
Hanging out
Having fun on the mainstreet
Living like we would
Live for ever
That sugared me whine
Like a runaway train
Watch you and know that I miss you like crazy

Sometimes
Oh maybe we were just too young
We were just too young

It was always you and me against the world
Breaking every rule
There was to break
Living in a firm where boy meets girl

Why'd you disappear, not saying a word?
Still I have the time of my life

Oh maybe we were just too young
Hanging out
Having fun on the mainstreet
Living like we would
Live for ever
That sugared me whine
Like a runaway train
Watch you and know that I miss you like crazy

Sometimes
Oh maybe we were just too young
We were just too young

Tell me, do you feel like I do
Or is it just a memory?

Oh maybe we were just too young
Hanging out
Having fun on the mainstreet
Living like we would
Live for ever
That sugared me whine
Like a runaway train
Watch you and know that I miss you like crazy

Sometimes
Oh maybe we were just too young
Hanging out
Having fun on the mainstreet
Living like we would
Live for ever
That sugared me whine
Like a runaway train
Watch you and know that I miss you like crazy

Sometimes
Baby, we were just too young
We were just too young
