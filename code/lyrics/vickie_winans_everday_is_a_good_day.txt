Everyday is a good day to give thanks unto the lord
Everyday is a good day to give thanks unto the lord
Everyday is a good day to give thanks unto the lord
To give thanks unto the lord
For all he's done for us

For he has done great things
He has done great things
He has done great things for us
He has done great things
He has done great things
So give thanks unto the lord
For all he's done for us

Oh how we love him, how we love him
How we love him for what he's done
How we love him, how we love him
We give thanks unto the lord
For all he's done for us

Everyday is a good day (repeat
To give thanks unto the lord
For all he's done for us
