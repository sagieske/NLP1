Song:

There's an old Christmas card in an old dusty trunk
And it brings back sweet mem'ries dear to me
'Tho it's faded and worn, it's as precious as the morn
When I found it 'neath our first Christmas tree.

Chorus:
I thrill with every word, every line
I guess I'm always sentimental 'round this time
Oh, pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the mem'ry of an old Christmas card.

Oh, pardon me if a tear falls among my Christmas cheer
It's the mem'ry of an old Christmas card.

It's the mem'ry of an old Christmas card...
