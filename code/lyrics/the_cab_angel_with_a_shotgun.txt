Song:

(I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun,
An angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun...)

Get out your guns, battles begun,
Are you a saint, or a sinner?
If loves a fight, than I shall die,
With my heart on a trigger.

They say before you start a war,
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
Fighting til' the wars won,
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
... And I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

Sometimes to win, you've got to sin,
Don't mean I'm not a believer.
... And major Tom, will sing along.
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer.

They say before you start a war,
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
Fighting til' the wars won,
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
... And I, wanna live, not just survive, tonight.

Ooohhh, ooohhh whoa whoa oooh whoa

I'm an angel with a shotgun...
Fighting til' the wars won...
I don't care if heaven won't take me back...

I'm an angel with a shotgun,
Fighting til' the wars won,
I don't care if heaven won't take me back.
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe.
Don't you know you're everything I have?
(I'm an angel with a shotgun)
... And I, want to live, not just survive, tonight.
(Live, not just survive)

... And I'm gonna hide, hide, hide my wings tonight.

They say before you start a war,
You better know what you're fighting for.
Well baby, you are all that I adore,
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be.
