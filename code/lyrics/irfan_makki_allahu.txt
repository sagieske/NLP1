Song:

[Jahan bhi deqon Allahu her khayal guftugoo jahan bhi jao Allahu miley
Mujay her manzeley] x2

I'll keep on searching I know I'll find Him He is beside me He is always
Close to my heart
Always in my heart we are never far apart
I always think of Him when I fell like I cannot go on

[Jahan bhi deqon Allahu her khayal guftugoo jahan bhi jao Allahu miley
Mujay her manzeley] x2

I'll keep on moving with everystep I take I'm feel closer I'll never lose my
Way
I always turn to Him when my faith is very thin
I always remember He is albaseero

[Jahan bhi deqon Allahu her khayal guftugoo jahan bhi jao Allahu miley
Mujay her manzeley] x2

I'll keep on praying for Him to guid me
I wont lose my patience
Believe us always come through

Always there for me especially in my time of need I raise my hand and I
Know He's listening to me

[Jahan bhi deqon Allahu her khayal guftugoo jahan bhi jao Allahu miley
Mujay her manzeley] x4
