They*do what they wanna do say, what they wanna say Live
how they wanna live play, how they wanna play Dance
how they wanna dance kick, and the slap a friend The
addams family Now

I was cold coolin' you, know (maxin' and relaxin') Just
kickin' it around the house (oaktown kicking' it) When
a knock a, knock a, knock and a voice yo Can!

I don't mind (mind) being a friend And
showin' a little bit of flava (flava) But
wednesday pugsley, gomez, fester, (oh man) Man

*

remember the day I needed to borrow A
little of pepper (for my chicken) The
next thing you know comin', at me Was
a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I'm witcha) Now
I tried to play it along (you know) And
act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha) But
what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (cousin it) Standin'
about three feet tall (I'm outta here) Speakin'

*

and thinkin' about the addams You
know the hammer is with it (I'm with it) Act
a fool no, bones swooop, goofy, and randy You
know we kick it (the posse) Now
is the time to get in your mind It's
ok to be yourself (be yourself) Take
foolish pride and put it aside Like
