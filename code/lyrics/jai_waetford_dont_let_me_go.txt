Song:

Ohh
Yeah

Baby please stay near
Don't know how I'd live without you here
It feels like I'm drowning I've got no air

Life is nothing without you here
So baby please don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go

You built me up then
You break me down
You could break my heart
Without a sound

You've got the softest touch
And no deceit
And no money or car could change
What you mean to me

Cause I'm falling in love with you
And I just can't help myself
Cause I'm falling in love with you

And I just can't help myselfffff

So please don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Ohhhh

Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Ohhhh

Don't let me go
