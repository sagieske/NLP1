Song:

All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Your burning sun with golden beam
Your silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him, O praise Him!
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
Your rushing wind and breezes soft
Your clouds that sail in heaven along
O praise Him, Alleluia!
Your rising morn in praise rejoice
Your lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him, O praise Him!
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!

Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly host
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship God in humbleness
O praise Him, Alleluia!
O praise the Father, praise the Son!
Praise the Spirit, Three in One!
O praise Him, O praise Him!
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!
