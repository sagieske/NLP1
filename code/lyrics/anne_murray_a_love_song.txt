Song:

There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high and sings so good
And he brings to you what he sings to you

Like my brother the wren and I
Well, he told if I try, I could fly for you
And I wanna try for you 'cause

CHORUS
I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern Lights and skies ablaze
And I bring to you, lover, when I sing to you

Silver wings in a fiery sky
Show the trail of my love and I
Sing to you, love is what I bring to you

And I wanna sing to you, oh

CHORUS

CHORUS

I wanna show you the peaceful feelin' of my home
