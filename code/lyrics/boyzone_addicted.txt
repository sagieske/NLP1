Song:

Just one more kiss
And I'll be gone
I won't write, I won't call you
No more girl, I swear that I'll be strong
Just one more taste of you
And I'll be fine
Girl I mean what I say today
But tomorrow I'll know that I was lying

Cos baby, oh
I only wish you knew
How this feeling scares me so
It's just like letting, just like letting go

And I guess is that's addiction
Then I guess that I'm addicted
And I guess that I'm your junkie, fair enough
(I'm your junkie)
And I guess if that's addiction
Then I guess that I'm your junkie
And I guess that I'm just strung out on your love

Girl I can't sleep
In these wet sheets
Cos I've got hot flushes, cold sweats
And a hunger that's making me weak

So hit me up
With your best stuff
All I need is a bag of attention
And maybe an ounce of your trust

Cos letting go
Is harder than you know
I'm tearing out my heart
To give my heart to you
As you walk right out of view

CHORUS

You go through my heart and through my soul
Like a river gone out of control
It takes my resolve and washes it all away

CHORUS

Don't walk away
I'm addicted
