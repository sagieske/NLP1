Song:

I was the anchor
On a heavy, sinking ship

And we're sinking faster
I am the only culprit

How did everything go wrong?
I'm trying to make sense of it

I've gotta stay strong
We've gotta stay
Strong

Don't you dare walk away
We're all here to stay

Remnants left of a time once knew
We can never go back to that place
Go back to that place

I'll be your lover,
In a room that's full of sins

I'm undercover
I should run, but I just can't help it

I'll taste like summer...
On a stormy, winter night

You taste like fire
Burning everything...
In sight

Don't you dare walk away
Please don't go away

Remnants left of a time once knew
We can never go back to that place...
Go back to that place

Masks we wear to disguise the truth
We can never go back to that...
Place!

So!

Go!
I said I will go!
Yeah!
I said I will go!

Go!
I said I will go!

Will!
Go!

Oh!

Remnants left of a time once knew
We can never go back to that place
Go back to that place

Masks we wear,
Times we shared
Times that we've shared

Remnants left of a time once knew
We can never go back to that
To that-
To that-
Place!
To that place

That place!
