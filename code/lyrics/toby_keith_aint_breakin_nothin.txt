Told ya when I met ya, "Don't try to love me"
But I love for tryin' to, anyway
You're cryin', and it don't surprise me 
That you can't find it in your heart to stay

This ain't the first time to be my own worst enemy
Baby, don't you worry about me

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' that I don't already know
You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
I ain't sayin' it won't kill me to watch you go
But you ain't breakin' nothin' that's already broke

I used up all the whiskey
Me and Jesus got by
But still, your goodbye kiss me
No matter how hard I try

I'm now lower than I like to go
This ain't the first time that I've dug out of this hole

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' I don't already know
You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
I ain't sayin' it won't kill me to watch you go
But you ain't breakin' nothin' that's already broke

Ain't already alone
Ain't already dealin' with you bein' gone

You ain't sayin' nothin' that ain't been said
You ain't leavin' somethin' that ain't been left
Ain't bringin' me nothin' I don't already know
You ain't doin' nothin' that ain't been done
Ain't startin' somethin' that ain't begun
I ain't sayin' it won't kill me to watch you go
Baby, you ain't breakin' nothin' that's already broke

Already broke
Already broke
Already broke
