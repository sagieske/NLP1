Song:

You're on the wrong side
Looking at the right side
This is the last light
At the end of the day
You're on a long flight
Taking your last bite
Of the good life before it goes away
Where'd you go oh where'd you go my friends
My friends
You said you would be there till the end, the end
Knock you down you get back up again, again
And when they run after you
You just run from them
Where are all the believers
Where are they when you need em'
Where are all of the healers
Why'd they run away
Where are all the believers
Where are all of the healers
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray
This is the right time
Baby to be mine
And taste the good life
Before it goes away
Know me down I get back up again, again
And if they run after me
I'll just run from them
Where are all the believers
Where are they when you need em'
Where are all of the healers
Why'd they run away
Where are all the believers
Where are all of the healers
Where are they when you need em to
Get down and pray
I need somebody to save me now
Somebody to save me now
Somebody to save me
