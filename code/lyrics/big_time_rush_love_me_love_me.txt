Song:

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
I'm I'm ready to go

Jaw drop heart stop we eye lock
I must be dreaming don't hit the alarm clock
Under the lights, coming alive, she thriller tonight

Hey

One dance two dance is not enough
You got that glow in the dark so I'm not giving up
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it, hide it

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
Love me love me say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor

I'm saying woah
Don't tell me no

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I'm I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go

Love me love me,
I'm ready to go

Can't stop, won't stop we party rock
You got them red velvet lips, sweet, like Betty Crock-Er
So call the doc-Tor
Cause someone needs to take your temperature you're getting hotter

Under the lights, comin' alive, she thrilla tonight
I'm reading your mind you know I'm a psychic
Why you try to hide it, hide it

When I rock, you roll
You're loosing control
And if you got that feeling throw your

Hands up in the air

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
Love me love me say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor

I'm saying woah
Don't tell me no

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go

You be Juliet I'll be Romeo
Whatcha' you waiting for you know you wanna go
Don't say goodbye cause we just said hello
Say your gonna love me girl cause I need to know

Ready! Go (x14)
Ready! Go (x14)

Lets do this

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I know you're ready to go
Love me love me say you're gonna love me
Don't leave me out on the floor

I'm saying woah
Don't tell me no

Love me love me say you're gonna love me
I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go

[2x]
Love me love me,
Love me love me,
I'm ready to go

I'm ready to go
