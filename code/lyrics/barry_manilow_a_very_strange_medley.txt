Song:

there's barkin' at the kitchen
yellin' in the hall
ringin' at the door bell
poundin' on the wall
kids out a sight
and kids in the way
no time to cook on this hectic day
come on,come on,come on
get a bucket of chicken
finger lickin' good
have a barrel of fun
goodbye ho-hum
say hello to your family
come on everyone
at Kuntukey Fried Chicken
have a barrel of fun

when ever you're driving
and where ever you're bound
like a good neighbor
State Farm is there
State Farm is there
State Farm is there

give your face somethin' to smile about
give your face somethin' to smile about
with stridex
doot, doo, doo
doo, doo, doo, doo,doo, doo
with stridex

I am stuck on a Band Aid
and a Band Aid's stuck on me
I am stuck on a Band Aid
and a Band Aid's stuck on me

I've got the bathroom bowl blues
I been meanin' to start cleanin' the bathroom
bowl
well, it's the lowdownest, bluest job in town
but tough green bowlene beats the bathroom
bowl blues

It's not a Cola

It's the most original soft drink ever in the
whole wide world
Doctor Pepper
Doctor Pepper
Doctor Pepper
Doctor Pepper
