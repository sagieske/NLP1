Song:

(Chorus 1:)

Oh oh, e get as you dey do me, do me, do me
Na the way you dey do me
Girl, I love the way you do me (do me 6x)
Boy, I love the way you do me (do me 6x)
Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh, my baby
Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh

(Verse 1:)

So na she step into the club house
See how the boys dem a drop down
And all the ladies just dey hala say
Them no know say wahala dey
If you no sodji, take am easy, make you no dey fall
This na the song for the dancehall
The way you move your body, ebe like say
(Ebe like say) you no know say wahala dey
Na the way you do the things you do
Ebe like say you get plans for me and you
If I put it on you, you put it on me
What a man can do, a woman can do

(Hook:)

If you do me, I do you, (man no go vex)
Step on the dance floor (man no go vex)
Touch me I touch you (man no go vex)
You say, I say (man no go vex)
If you do me, I do you, (man no go vex)
Step on the dance floor (man no go vex)
So won't you give it to me (I will give it to you)
So make you give it to me some more (some more)
E get as e dey do me, so make you give it to me, give it to me
Eget us e dey do me, so make you give it to me some more
E get as e dey do me, so make you give it to me
Na the way you dey do me (do me 3x)
So you can give it to me some more

So make you do me (do me 6x)
Make you do me (do me 6x)

(Verse 2:)

Omo, check out the way she twist and wind it
Make me feel like and grind it, grind it
Every girl, I know say you dey eye me, eye me
After the show na the party for my room
Strictly for me and you, you
We get plenty things to do, do
So pull off the bump... And move, make we groove

Boy, you know say talk is cheap I know
You are tempted to roll with me
Me, I no be the bizzy body wey you see
What a man can do, a woman can do so

(Repeat Hook:)

Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh, my baby
Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh

From the way you do the things you do
Ebe like say you get plans for me and you
Me, I no be the bizzy body wey you see
What a man can do, a woman can do so

Repeat Hook till fade

Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh, my baby
Na the way you dey do me, do me
You go wound oh, you go wound oh
