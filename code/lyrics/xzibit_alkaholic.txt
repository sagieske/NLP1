[Xzibit]
It's that millenium ridiculous flow, I never let go
Ni***z gettin knocked out is part of my show
Let em know who they fuckn wit yo: a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular, push off the hillside strangler
Dangle a, n***a by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk a** go, look out below (Belowwww)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box
(hah!) with my fresh pressed khakis in a slingshot
So beatbox all day in a n***a face
And all you b*****s see the d**k that you shoulda ate

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gonna put no extras on it

[Erick Sermon]
Yo, I'm in the zone, and lyrically gone
Got the spot blown, boom! Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a n***a head til his neck pop
Do a kr's one to a black cop
X and E's, out for cream, get the money
While you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uhh, give it to yall, in Any Given Sunday
With J. Fox namin tha spot, make it hot
(I hate E so much right now!) Blow it down n***a, bounce
Come off the ropes like J. Snooka
(Two fly motherfuckers) You can't f**k widdit
Backed by Open Bar, so y'all forget it

[Chorus:]
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gonna put no extras on it

[J-Ro]
J Mcenroe, cam smashin, party crashin
I eat mc's like a ration
I'm sockin ni***z in their goatees
I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin ten G's
Cause we need a bag of weed (can you smell it?)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on these like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin liquid by tha gallons

[Tash]
Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin, head rushin
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest mc who wanna get it
Forget it, it's liquid, don't mix it, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap b*****s on the a**, I slap pimps about the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistant
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin difference
For instance, 21 and over, set your clocks back
(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's restless
(Thirty ni***z, sixty hoes) and that's the motherfuckin guestlist

[Chorus:]
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gotta put no extras on it
Call it what you wanna call it
I'm a fuckin Alkaholik
Bring it if you really want it
Ain't gonna put no extras on it
