Song:

All my friends
Alone on a hill
They're just looking down
With violent minds out on loan
They're just not equipped

Insistence
We hope for the best
Were not making sense in silence
Wait for the day when you're better than...

In this silence, I'm not buying
You're not faking, you're not...
I guess we better hold on

Again this time
We won't understand again
I'm not waiting for some sense
This time, we won't understand again
I'm not waiting for

Still they sit
Alone on a hill
Their mechanical thoughts have left
The out on their own
They're not buying this

In this silence, I'm not buying
You're not faking, you're not...
I guess we better hold on

Again this time
We won't understand again
I'm not waiting for some sense
This time, we won't understand again
I'm not waiting for
