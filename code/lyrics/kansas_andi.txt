Song:

Andi won't dance
Andi won't sing
Andi won't play
She sits in her room, hiding away, hiding away

She hasn't a friend
They think she's a boy, they leave her alone
But what they don't know
Andi has dreams, all of her own

Yea, she wants to be a lady
Can anyone see?
That's she's trapped inside a little boy's body
She's waiting
For the dream of her life
To be a lady
That's all she wants to be

[Chorus:]
Andi you're not just anyone
Don't be ashamed
Open the door, don't hide away
Your dreams will awaken

Andi you're not just anyone
Don't take the blame
Though you're scared and all alone
You'll be there someday
Oh Andi, you're old enough to know
Don't ask me why
The leaves they fall down from the trees
But in the spring, they come again
Yes, they come again
Oh Andi, don't be afraid
Oh Andi

Andi can you hear me?
Will you come out on your own?

Oh the voice in the distance
Saying don't be afraid, Andi
I will make you somebody
I will make you a lady
The dream of your life
A lady, is what you will be

[Chorus:]
