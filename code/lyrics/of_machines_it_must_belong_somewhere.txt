Song:

This place feels so surreal
Am I alive?
Alive?
(Am I Alive?)
Her perfume fills the room but will it die?
Die?
(Will this die?)

I never been the one to hold something for so long
(As you dig in my soul...)
It must belong somewhere
It must have some sort of grasp on me
(It gets clearer...)

I need to fill your lungs
Don't let this light go out
We can't let this take us
We can't let this take us
It won't be long

I've seen this place before
I've been here before
But why do I not know my way
(And for you I'd do anything...)
(Just let me be your world...)

I need to fill your lungs
Don't let this light go out
We can't let this take us
We can't let this take us
It won't be long

It won't be long
Don't let this go out
