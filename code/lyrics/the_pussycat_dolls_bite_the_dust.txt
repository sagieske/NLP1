Song:

Bite the dust
Trust me, anything you can do
I can do better than you
Bite the dust
Some things really impossible
You're no exception to rules
Bite the dust
How many times I gotta tell you?
He don't even see you
Bite the dust
You see, I'm really helping you
I'm keeping you from looking a fool
She's got a plan to have my man
She's going to have to deal with me

Ooh, sugar I got him
I got 20/20 vision
I can see that you want my man
Ooh, sugar I got him
'Cause it's my job
To make you understand
Ooh, sugar I got him
Try to make a move
And I'm on him like 5-0
Ooh, sugar I got him
So you can go
'Cause I got him
Got him

Bite the dust
Big girl, I really hope
You get the message I'm trying to convey
Bite the dust
'Cause you're pushing me to the edge
And I ain't got time to play
Bite the dust
How many times I gotta tell you?
He's where he wants to be
Bite the dust
Keep on, act like you didn't know
My hands going to do the talking today
She's got a plan to have my man
She's going to have to deal with me

Ooh, sugar I got him
I got 20/20 vision
I can see that you want my man
Ooh, sugar I got him
'Cause it's my job
To make you understand
Ooh, sugar I got him
Try to make a move
And I'm on him like 5-0
Ooh, sugar I got him
So you can go
'Cause I got him
Got him

Ooh
Ooh
Yeaahhh
Give it up
Give it up (Oh)
Give it up
Give, give, give it up

Ooh I know what she wants
Ooh I know
My man
She's got a plan to have my man
She's going to have to deal with me

Ooh, sugar I got him
I got 20/20 vision
I can see that you want my man
Ooh, sugar I got him
'Cause it's my job
To make you understand
Ooh, sugar I got him
Try to make a move
And I'm on him like 5-0
Ooh, sugar I got him
So you can go
'Cause I got him
Got him

Bite the dust
I got 20/20 vision
I can see that you want my man
Bite the dust
'Cause it's my job
To make you understand
Bite the dust
Try to make a move
And I'm on him like 5-0
Bite the dust
So you can go
'Cause I got him
Got him
