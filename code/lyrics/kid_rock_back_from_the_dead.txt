Song:

Back from the dead second L. P. Here we go
Comin at ya from the are. O. M. E. O.
Pistol packed with a crew'o fly slimmys
Hat turned back in some airwalk jimmys
Never slackin hoes I be mackin
Not wacked I don't try to act black when
I came up I came at ya from the outskirts
Bag of weed in the pocket of my sweatshirt
Bone 2 the bone 2 the bad 2 the bad 2 the bone
Hit bound from the mo-town allen
F**k a 40 I drink it by the gallon
I started out in mount clemens as a D. J.
Park parties gettin drunk on sunday
Tweeked in the heat 2 a beat I'd rock 2 the -and rip s**t up
An now I've toured this nation
Pimp of the nation
Pullin hoes
Rock the set in each city then step
Me, blackman and funk daddy def stef
B*****s, they think I'm sexist
But all I want baby is your grits for breakfast
Eggs, bacon, home cooked fries
And gimme a plate of that p***y on the side
Triple x on the set showin no class
Just a foul mouthed little fuckin smart a**
No fool I went 2 high school dumb a**
Smoked dope and I flunked every class
Slash and I smash 'cause I thrash when I bash
Invite me to a party and your house'll get trashed
An outcast sick of being harassed so I dashed
Moved out of the crib 'cause I hated cuttin grass
Now I reside on the eastside lovin it
Cold 40 dog in a brown bag chuggin it
Flex, s**, run of the next
Flippin and trippin and rippin and shakin the suckers who wanted 2
Front an get around 2 the
2 get up or get down 2 the rhyme
I'm shakin and takin and breakin I rip the mic like
Every time f**k I don't eat no manwich
Kickin back coolin with a cold grits sandwich
Somebody said I'm the best in the mo-town
But this town ain't s**t but a ghost town
Who ever said it they lied they fessed
B***h I'm the best in the mother fuckin midwest
Wanna be heard when I rap so I yell it
Sport a tigers cap like my man tom selleck
One bad b***h I smoke hash from a stick
Got more cash than fuckin white boy rick
My first lp wasn't pushed for s**t
So jive records yo, go and suck a fat d**k
'cause I'm rippin like a chainsaw
Yes I'm that raw laughin' at ya suckers like hee haw
Roll it up, take a hit and then pass it
That's how we do it when we roll down gratiot
In my grand marquis I pimp to the beat
Two in the front and two hoes in the back seat
