Song:

[Verse:]
He put the coffee in the cup and with milk he filled it up
He added sugar and I never knew he liked it like that

[Verse:]
He took his coat from the hook and his scarf and his hat
And he put down a key and said I won’t be needing that
And he turned and smiled and said that explained it all
And he walked down the hall and he opened the door
And said I’ll call, I’ll call

[Chorus:]
Why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain
Why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away

[Verse:]
Now there’s a black black black bird in my chest
All the flatter all changed in
Wanting to break free with the wolves in my head
You’re tearing every words that I should have said

[Chorus:]
Why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain
Why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away

[Bridge:]
We’re like the strangers we were
When we first met
But the pain in strangers had the end
And all that remains is a day without plans
The loneliness and the forever lost

[Chorus:] x2
Why do I bring you love
When all you give me back is pain
Why do we search it out
To watch you wash your hands and walk away
