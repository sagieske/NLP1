Song:

Love's the only thing I know in this life
That's cut me deeper than the sharpest knife
And once again, here I am
And I'd pay any price for a new love

I still hurt for the one I lost
I'm standin' here on a bridge that I can't get across
And I can't burn, but I will
When I walk with a new love

(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)
It's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm lookin' for
A new love for this ol' heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again
(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love
For this ol' heart of mine

Said I'm lookin' for a new love
Somebody tell me where I'll find a new love
For this ol' heart of mine

Love's the only thing that's ever made me cry
But nothin's ever made me feel more alive
And that's why, once again, here I am
Lookin' for the eyes of a new love

I know that somewhere in this world tonight
There's a guy, and I'd take a bus, car, a train or a flight
I'd even walk if I thought I might find a new love

(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)
It's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm lookin' for
A new love for this ol' heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again
(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love
For this ol' heart of mine

Said I need a new love
For this ol' heart of mine

(And/Oh) I believe (I believe that)
It's gonna be better than ever before
That's why I'm lookin' for
A new love for this ol' heart
A new love and I just can't wait to start
(To feel that way again) I wanna feel that way again
(Oh I'm wonderin' when) On when I find my new love
For this ol' heart of mine

Oh, I'm lookin' for a new love
For this ol' heart of mine
Said, I need a new love
For this ol' heart of mine
Oh, I'm lookin' for a new love
Somebody tell me where I'll find (a new love)
For this ol' heart of mine
