Song:

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies, and say that it's forever?
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?
Ooh yeah

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

When I'm with you, are you somewhere else?
Am I gettin' thru, or do you please yourself?
When you wake up, will you walk out?
It can't be love, if you throw it about
Ooh c'mon

I don't wanna touch you too much baby
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise
Love begs, love pleads
It's what I need

It's no surprise!

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise

Love bites, love bleeds
It's bringin' me to my knees
Love lives, love dies
It's no surprise

Love bites!
