Song:

Maybe I should drop you at you door
And leave tonight and vanish up the shore
Anywhere but here
It's three o'clock I'm driving in your car
Your screaming at the window at the stars
Please don't drive me home

Blame us cause we are who we are
Hate us cause you'll never get that far
And who'd suppose that you would go
I've already learned enough to know that...

Tell me all the places we can go
You count the headlights passing on the road
A long long time ago

Blame us cause we are who we are
Hate us cause you'll never get that far
And who'd suppose that you would go
I've already learned enough to know that...

Here here we are foreign to their world
Straight and composed
Your sermons I can do without
I've finally found that
Everybody loves to love you
When you're far away

Could it be we've done something wrong
I'll make it back to your place before dawn
Please don't drive me home
Please don't take me home

Blame us cause we are who we are
Hate us cause you'll never get that far
And who'd suppose that you would go
I've already learned enough to know that...
