Song:

I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you

Honey don't go don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say we told you so
Don't tell me you love me and then let me go
I heard the warning voice
From friends and my relation
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you

People can change they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you
Or can it be that like love I am blind
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind
One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you
Being with you being with you
