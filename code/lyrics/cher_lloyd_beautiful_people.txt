Cher Lloyd:

It's my last big breath what you want me to do
When you act all cool like you already knew
Then I'll be stuck here cold, just waiting it through
Till your heart starts beating for that somebody new
You know that it's true

Cause it's beautiful people like you, who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you, who suck the life right out of my heart
And it's beautiful people like you, who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you

Carolina Liar:

It's a wicked game that your making me play (making me play)
Where I crawl back home as your walking away (hey, hey)
Then it's all quite clear what you want me to say (what you want me to say)
But you'll be so long gone if I ask you to stay

You know that it's true

Both:

Cause it's beautiful people like you, who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you, who suck the life right out of my heart
And it's beautiful people like you, who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you (cruel as you, as you)

(Hey, hey, hey) X2

Cher Lloyd:

It's my last big breath, what you want me to do
When you act all cool, like you already knew

Both:

Cause it's beautiful people like you, who get whatever they want
And it's beautiful people like you, who suck the life right out of my heart
And it's beautiful people like you, who make me cry
Cause nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you

Nobody else could be nearly as cruel as you, as you
