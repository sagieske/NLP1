Song:

Have you ever had the feeling you were being watched
Footsteps behind you like a shadow when you walk
Can't tell if your mind is playing tricks or not eh, eh, eh, eh, no

What I'm going through is now racking brain
Thinking back like do I got any enemies
Where I been, what I did, what did I say, eh, eh, eh, eh, yeah

Come to think of it I remember one chick
That I was messing with when I was in Connecticut
I met her after my show, I took her back to my room, the next day I had to go
I never thought it would get this deep, now I've got this problem following me
You'd better be careful, better be careful, better be careful whose heart you break
Never know when what you do or say
Will send them over the edge so next time I'll be careful

I'm getting letters every other day addressed to me
Saying " dear Jason you and I were meant to be
Tell me you feel the same or it'll be the death of me", eh eh
It gets worse now
She reaching out to all my people, friends and family
Got me so paranoid I'm stepping up security
It's getting crazier, it's difficult for me to sleep, eh, eh, eh, eh, no

Now all I'm thinking is how do I get out of this
I'm feeling kinda sick, damn this is some crazy s**t

I met her after my show, I took her back to my room, the next day I had to go
I never thought it would get this deep, now I've got this problem following me
You'd better be careful, better be careful, better be careful whose heart you break
Never know when what you do or say
Will send them over the edge so next time I'll be careful

Yeah
Oh I'll be careful
Oh yeah, woah

This got so out of control, I learned my lesson now so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful
She's holding on wont let go, she wants a piece of my soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh be careful

I met her after my show, I took her back to my room, the next day I had to go
I never thought it would get this deep, now I've got this problem following me
You'd better be careful, better be careful, better be careful whose heart you break
Never know when what you do or say
Will send them over the edge
I never thought it would get this deep, now I've got this problem following me
You'd better be careful, better be careful, better be careful whose heart you break
Never know when what you do or say
Will send them over the edge so next time I'll be careful

Oh, oh
Be careful
