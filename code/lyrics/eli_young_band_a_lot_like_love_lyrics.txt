Song:

Yeah, love's a new born baby smile
Daddy walking his daughter down the aisle
A long first kiss that lingers in your mind
The smell of that first summer rain
A feeling that you can't explain
Makes you wish you could go back in time

Out of all the memories, good and bad
Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one
And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
It sure felt a lot like love

And I wasted good years running round
Trying to be the king of this old town
Always moving onto something new
The time goes by and I'm still here
And all the new has disappeared
Finally I'm forced to face the truth

Out of all the memories, good and bad
Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one
And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
It sure felt a lot like love

Do you every think about me?
Do you ever feel the same?
Am I just a faded picture
In a broke and dusty frame?

Out of all the memories, good and bad
Still find myself looking for what we had
I always thought I'd find a better one
And I bought into that young man's life
Looking back now I realize
I still don't know exactly what it was
Oh, it felt a lot like love
A lot like love, yeah
