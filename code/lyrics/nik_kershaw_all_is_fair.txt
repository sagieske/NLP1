Song:

Your lips are sealed, your mouth is dry
Your tongue is well and truly tied
And so you bottle up inside
The feeling you've got
She's your moon, she's your sun
She could even be the one
Best regret the things you've done
Than those you have not
Don't hold back today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't let her get away
Lie, beg, steal or borrow,
Cos all is fair
Yeah, all is fair
You want to taste her honey lips
You want to be her chocolate chips
You want to catch her as she slips
Through your fingers
And very soon, before you know
You'll be "Jilted Romeo"
On some day time T. V. Show
Like Jerry Springer's
Don't hold back today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't let her get away
Lie, beg, steal or borrow,
Cos all is fair
Yeah, all is fair
So ask her out, you'll never guess
She could say no, she could say yes
But you won't see the show unless
You buy a ticket
Will she fall under your spell
Will she blush and say farewell
Or will she smile at you and tell
You where to stick it?
Don't hold back today
Don't wait for tomorrow
Don't let her get away
Lie, beg, steal or borrow,
Cos all is fair
