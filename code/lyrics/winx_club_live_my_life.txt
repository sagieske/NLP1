Song:

I heard you say that I'm a rebel
That I don't follow any rule
And you know it won't get better
Cause I won't change my attitude
For no one

Daddy please don't be upset
Remeber when you were my age
You were so restless
We're the same
So won't me set me free
This is just me
Love me for who I really I am

I wanna live my life
Don't wanna hurt your feelings
Just open your mind
I may be young at heart but nothings gonna stop me
I'm gonna find my way
Nobody seems to understand
I just need to be myself

You taught me all I know that's why
I will always be your girl
I want to a bear in the world
I don't wanna be on chains
No more
What I am trying to say

I want to live my life
Don't want to hurt your feelings
Just open up your mind

I may be young at heart but nothing is gonna stop me
I'm gonna find my way
Nobody seems to understand
I just need to be myself

Hold me
Love me
Trust me
Open your mind, Open your mind
I know who I am and I'm
Living my life, Living my life

I want to live my life
Don't want to hurt your feelings
Just open up your mind

I may be young at heart but nothing is gonna stop me
I'm gonna find my way
Nobody seems to understand
I just need to be myself

Hold me
Love me
Trust me
Open your mind, Open your mind
I know who I am and I'm
Living my life, Living my life
