Song:

In the early morning when I'm lying by your side
Doubts go through my mind, thoughts I try to hide
Lying there I wonder if your love for me is real
Or just another fantasy

Then I try to think about the way things used to be
Misty memories, hazy like a dream
All we did together, all the things we planned to do
There was only me and you

And in the morning I touch you and I find you're still there
I want to tell you that I love you, please never leave me
In the morning light I turn to look at you
And hope that you still care

When I look back on our life, the pieces fall in place
Words that went unsaid, pictures of your face
All those things we shared, yet stay together day by day
'Cause our love was never far away

And in the morning I touch you and I find you're still there
I want to tell you that I love you, please never leave me
In the morning light I turn to look at you
And hope that you still care
