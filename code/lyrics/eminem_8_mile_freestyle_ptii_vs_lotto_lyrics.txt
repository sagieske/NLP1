[Spoken]
Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward once and for all.
I'm sick of the motha fucka! Check this s**t out!
[Rap]
I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me!
This s**t is a horror flick,
But the black guy doesn't die in this movie!
Fu***n' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kiddin!
That makes me believe you really don't have a interest in livin!
You think these n****s gonna feel the s**t you say?
I got a betta chance joining the kkk.
Or some real s**t, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit sucide to
f**k 'Lotto, ' call me your leader
I feel bad I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It To Beaver"
I used to like that show, now you got me to "fight back" mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!
I hate to do this, I would love for this s**t to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my a**
And all's well that ends well, ok?
So I'll end this s**t wit a "FUCK you, but have a nice day!"

[Eminem]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!
Quick, someone get his a** another steriod!
"Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity bloo blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said, "hipidy hooblah!"
Is that a tank top, or a new bra?
Look, Snoop Dogg just got a fu***n' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head?
Pay attention, you're sayin the same s**t that he said!
Matter fact, dog, here's a pencil
Go home, write some s**t, make it suspenseful,
And don't come back until something dope hits you
f**k it! You can take the mike home with you!
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you,
Tank top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far those white jokes get you
Boy's like "How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?"
My motto: f**k Lotto!
I get the 7 digits from your mother for a dolla tomorrow!
