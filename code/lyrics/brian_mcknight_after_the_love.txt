Song:

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, ahh, ooh, hey hey

[verse]
I thought that love would conquer all
But nothing could break my fall
The moment you left my sid
And now there's nothing left to say
Since you took you love away
I been yearning for you deep inside

[b sec]
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
When I think about the the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on
Can I go on

[Chorus:]
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours (mine and yours)
Will I ever get over
'Cause I've come to know that
It's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

[verse]
If I on; y had a clue
That I'd end up losing you
I might of held on to my heart
Taking for granted you'd be mine
'Til the end of time
Has torn my world apart

[b-sec]
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong
(where you belong)
When I think, think about the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on

[Chorus:]
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the love you thought was yours (mine and yours)
Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

[musical interlude]

[b-sec]
I can't believe that it's over
In my arms is where you belong (where you belong)
When I think of all the love we shared
How did we go wrong
And how can I go on

[Chorus:]
Sometimes you can't let go
Of the the love you thought was yours, mine and yours
Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
That it's so hard to carry on
After the love is gone
After the love is gone

[end section]

(And after the love)
After the love is gone
Life must go on
[repeat 5 times w/ad lib]
After the love is gone
