Song:

You know just the other morning
I was hanging around in my house
I had that old book with picutres of Madonna naked
And I was checkin' it out
Just then a friend of mine came to the door
She said she never pegged me for a scumbag before
Said she didn't ever want to see me no more
And I still don't why/

I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright

This one time for medicinal purposes they forced me to smoke some dope
I'm pretty sure I can still be the President
But I don't think I'll ever get to be the Pope
Well I get wild and I know I get drunk
It's not like I got a bunch of bodies in my trunk
My old man used to call me a no-good punk
And I still don't know why

I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright

You know just the other night
The cops pulled me over outside the bar
When they turned on their lights
And they ordered me out my car
Man I was only kiddin' when I called 'em a couple of dicks
But still they made me do the stupid human tricks
Now I'm stuck in this jail with a bunch of dumb hicks
And I still don't know why

I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm an alright guy
Well I just want to live until I gotta die
I know I ain't perfect but God knows I try
I think I'm an alright guy
I think I'm alright
