Song:

A thousand words that no one's spoken
Now there's nothing left to say
Another dream just got broken
You suggest you're not that way, yeah

I want you to love me
Want you to know I'm just like you
Just like you

Another dream just got broken
Another dreamer just like you
You

A thousand words just like you
A thousand words just like you
A thousand words just like you
