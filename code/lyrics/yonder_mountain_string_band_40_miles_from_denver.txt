Song:

It's a cold, cold moon out tonight
And it's a cold, cold point on your knife
Could I call myself a man if I left by the morning light?

And I'd be 40 miles from Denver when you woke up all alone
I'd be 40 miles from Denver and three days from my home
In that cool mountain air, on an Appalachian trail
Ohh, life is better there

It's a lonely road to travel on
But I've stood here waiting much too long
And I'd rather leave this minute than try to carry on

And I'd be 40 miles from Denver headed east bound on the track
I'd be 40 miles from Denver and trying to get back
To that cool mountain air, on an Appalachian trail
Ohh, life is better there

It's a cold, cold moon out tonight
And it's a cold, cold point on your knife
Could I call myself a man if I left by the morning light?

And I'd be 40 miles from Denver when you woke up all alone
I'd be 40 miles from Denver and three days from my home
In that cool mountain air, on an Appalachian trail
Ohh, life is better there (4x)
