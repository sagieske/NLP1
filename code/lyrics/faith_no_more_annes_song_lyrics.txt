Song:

"HEY!" what?? "Oh nothing, just wondering why it is you're doing
that whatever it is you're doing. "Oh yeah, why?" I dunno it just
doesn't seem like something you'd be doing that's all you of all
people, know what I mean? "Yeah I know it's been bugging you since the
day I was born, huh? I asked my friend Anne about it. I said, 'Anne,
Anne, Anne, what am I supposed to do, huh? It's been bugging them since the
day that I was born. ' She said 'Do whatever the hell you want to do!
Now is the time where you can do anything, everything you do, anything it 's still gonna turn out great. You've got the world at your feet. '"
I never claimed to be different, I only said I was bored and she's
tired of your uniqueness, it sends her over head first then the rest
of her follows, the breath of life, it never left her hollow...
I can do everything, she said, she says with a smile.
And I can go anywhere tonight, cause I'm with Anne.
Anne, Anne, Who? Anne Dagnabit Island princess girl with the juice
ooh what have we here? Oh I see she brought her whole uptown contingent. First there's Jonny, he always loves a party, he's followed by Vinnie, who's feelin' kinda skinny, he says "Hey Anne I'm starved what you got to eat, she
says "Vinnie you're always hungry man get away from that fridge!
Here comes Lucy, she's feelin' really s***, she's followed by her
boyfriend, who'd better not turn around, this time, or he's bound to lose
her, yeah followed by Jamilla, who's got the cream soda...
I can do anything I want I tell you again
We can go anywhere tonight, cause we're with Anne
and we can do anything we want, I tell you again
We can go anywhere tonight, cause we're with Anne
Anne, Anne, Who? Anne Dagnabit Island princess girl with the juice
