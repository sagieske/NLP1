Song:

Another Day
Natalie Grant

I've been driving through the night
Pull up and see the lights
This is the place that I call home

I watch you as you dream
I think of all you mean to me
Touch your face, kiss you softly

And before I go to sleep, I pray under the stars
Search my soul and check my heart

CHORUS:
(I) thank God for another day, another chance
To love the ones I love
To find my way
To laugh, to dance
And watch the sun come up
Another day I get to live
As if every breath could be the last I take
I get another day

I have a hand that I can hold
Someone who knows my soul
A safe place to lay my head at night
Still sometimes I forget
Just how much I've been blessed in life
I forget what means the most to me, yeh
But I'm waking up again
I feel my beating heart
So grateful that I've come this far

CHORUS

Another day to make somebody smile
To go the extra mile
To take a wrong and make it right
Yeh, I'm tryin' to touch somebody's life
I get another day
Yeh

CHORUS
