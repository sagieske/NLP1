Song:

Your wardrobe's purchased
At the latest boutique
Your place is furnished
Like the President's suite

Your freezer's filled up
With the finest of meat
Somehow you manage
On a hundred a week

They say you like to feel
White gold on your neck
They say when you make love
You like to direct

And that new sports car
You proceeded to wreck
They say I ought to ask
Who picked up the check

[Chorus:]
I can take care of myself
My friends all say
I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice

Attempts to charm you
Met with little success
I never met someone
So hard to impress

Until one day by chance
You saw my address
The next day you had on
Your lowest cut dress

[Repeat chorus]

Aw, play the song, boys
Play the song

They could be correct
In their judgment of you
Maybe you'll take me
And make me a fool

But I'm a big boy
And I know what to do
It might be worth it
To wake up next to you

[Repeat chorus]

I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
Oh, I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
Yeah, I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
