Song:

Well a-go baby - go baby - go baby go baby
Go baby - go baby - go baby go baby
Go baby - go baby go baby
Won't you come out tonight

Well baby won't you come out tonight
Underneath the moon so bright
We'll have fun cuttin' a rug
Won't you come out my little honey bug
Oh baby won't you come out tonight

Well baby the moon is so bright
And if you'll only come out it'll be just right
We'll make all the night spots
And for you - that's not a lot
Oh baby won't you come out tonight

Well baby I love you so
And I hope your answer won't be "no"
If you'll come out - we'll rock and roll
Come on baby - let's go
Baby won't you come out tonight
