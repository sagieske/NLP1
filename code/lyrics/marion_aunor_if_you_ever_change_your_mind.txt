Song:

There was once a time
When I thought of no one else but you
You'd look into my eyes
And I'd see the whole world in front of me

We were perfect for each other
No one else would dare compare, no
Thought that we were steadfast
But feelings don't last, oh no

But if you ever change your mind
Don't you dare come back to me crying
I want you back again
Cause though what we had was more than fine
I needed someone who would love me
More than he loved himself

You said you'd never lie
That you'd never make me cry, my dear
Did you mean every word you said
Or were you messing with my head all these years

Were we perfect for each other
Or was this all just pretend, oh
Seems it ended so fast
But feelings don't last, oh no

But if you ever change your mind
Don't you dare come back to me crying
I want you back again
Cause though what we had was more than fine
I needed someone who would love me
More than he loved himself

More than he loved himself
Himself
Him-self

But if you ever change your mind
Don't you dare come back to me crying
I want you back again
Cause though what we had was more than fine
I needed someone who would love me
More than he loved himself
