Song:

Maybe there's something in me
Trying to hitch another ride
Have you ever felt this moment
When you're looking out of control
All the ways I could have taken
Just add up to indecision

I'm gonna get this back on line
To me there's no reason why
All my troubles soon be leaving
Wash away the pain of mine

Get me to the place I'm standing
There's a reason down below
Maybe there's something in me
Trying to take another ride
Have you ever felt the moment
When you're loosing all control

I'm gonna get this back on line
To me there's no reason why
All my troubles soon be leaving
Wash away the pain of mine

All my troubles soon be leaving
All my troubles soon be leaving
All my troubles soon be leaving
All my troubles soon be leaving

(Mine)
(Mine)
All my troubles soon be leaving
(Mine)
All my troubles soon be leaving
(Mine)
All my troubles soon be leaving
(Mine)
(Mine)
(Mine)
(Mine)
(Mine)
(Mine)
