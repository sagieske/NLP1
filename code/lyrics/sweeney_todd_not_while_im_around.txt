Song:

Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
Nothing's gonna harm you
No sir, not while I'm around

Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays
I'll send 'em howling
I don't care, I got ways

No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there

Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time nothing can harm you
Not while I'm around

Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart but I ain’t dumb
I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome
Not to worry, mum

Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true
I don't need to, I would never
Hide a thing from you
Like some

Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
Nothing's gonna harm you, Toby
Not while I'm around

Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays
I'll send 'em howling
I don't care

No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there

Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while
But in time nothing’s gonna harm you
Not while I'm around
