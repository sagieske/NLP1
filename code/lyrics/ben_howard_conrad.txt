Song:

[Verse:]
Climb out, out to where you see
The curl of the world, when we're alone
Just like you said cold cold world
Life lasts only one thing left to burn last year to learn

[Chorus:]
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea 
And you knew that!
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
Oh, I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back!

[Verse 2:]
Oh, climb out, out enough to see
The curl of the world
Oh, we're alone just 
Like you said last year to learn

[Chorus:]
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea 
And you knew that!
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
Oh, I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back!

[Chorus:]
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change to the weather and the sea 
And you knew that!
You were the boat that bridged in the tale of Conrad
Oh, I loved you with the good and the careless of me
But it all goes back!
