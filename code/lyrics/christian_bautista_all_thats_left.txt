Song:

All that's left, all that's left
All that's left of me
All that's left, all that's left
All that's left of me

You know I'm not alright
Cause all that I've been through
Has left me cold inside
And feelin' like a fool
But even when I don't say a word
Somehow you understand

Cause I've been hurt before
And healin' takes so long
Trust shattered on the floor
Pretending to be strong
But girl you picked up the pieces
And showed me just how you belong
So I must sing this song

You're the best thing that has ever happened to me
Thought I'd locked my heart but you found the key
You bring out the best in whatever's left of me
All that's left of me

All that's left, all that's left
All that's left of me

I'd given up the fight
My heart would never mend
I couldn't see the light
Or find the tunnel's end
Thought I would never feel it again
And then I met you

You made me realize
Courtesy of lyricshall. Com
What loving's all about
Building each other's lives
Casting aside all doubt
So I take this leap of faith
Cause I can't imagine life without you

You're the best thing that has ever happened to me
Thought I'd locked my heart but you found the key
And when it's all done, holding you in my arms
Feels just how it should be

Your eyes take me off to a special space
With you everything seems to fall into place
You bring out the best in whatever's left of me
All that's left of me... Left of me
You bring out the best in whatever's left of me

You're the best thing that has ever happened to me
Thought I'd locked my heart but you found the key
And when it's all done, holding you in my arms
Feels just how it should be

Your eyes take me off to a special space
With you everything seems to fall into place
You bring out the best in whatever's left of me
All that's left of me...
All that's left of me...

All that's left
All that's left
All that's left of me
