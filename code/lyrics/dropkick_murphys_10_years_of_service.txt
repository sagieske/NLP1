Song:

The status of our future in both past and present time,
Is relegated to a member of a higher class than mine.
To Determine and direct the lives of family men who bear the burden
Of living up to standard that doesn't exist in 1999

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save us from this lonely picket line,
10 years of service but I'm still not worth your time.
And I've seen men give their lives,
And heard the stories that they tell of how they labored
For this company which sold it's soul to hell

Times may be changing but I'll never leave behind the hopes
And thoughts I have of better days for families such as mine.
Because if history repeats itself and time will surely tell.
What goes around will come around and you'll know our pain too well.

[Chorus]
