Song:

You got me caught in all this mess.
I guess we can blame it on the rain.
My pain is knowing I can't have you.
I can't have you.

Tell me.
Does she look at you the way I do?
Try to understand the words you say
And the way you move?
Does she get the same big rush?
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy?
Or is this more than a crush?
Hey...

I catch my breath.
The one you took the moment you entered the room.
My heart, it breaks at the thought
Of her holding you.

Does she look at you the way I do?
Try to understand the words you say
And the way you move?
Does she get the same big rush?
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy?
Or is this more than a crush?
Is it more than a crush?

Maybe I'm alone in this,
But I find peace in solitude
Knowing if I had but just one kiss
This whole room would be glowing.
We'd be glowing.
We'd be glowing.

Does she?
Tell me does she look at you the way I do?
Try to understand the words you say
And the way you move?
Does she get the same big rush?
When you go in for a hug and your cheeks brush?
Tell me am I crazy?
Or is this more than a crush? (x2)
