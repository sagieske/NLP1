Song:

Yo (one time)
I was born by the river (uh) (uh)
In a tentement
Oh, my poor mother,
She could hardly pay the rent

It's been a long (ha)
A long time comin
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will

(two time) (yea)
It's been too hard livin (huh)
And I'm afraird to die
(why?)
I don't know
Whats out there
Yea, yea,
Beyond the sky

It's been a long (huh)
A long time comin
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh (oh) yes it will

(say it whyclef, check it out, say it, uh uh)
Oh my

See I go, to my brotha
(c'mon!) (and say what, say what)
And I say brotha
Help me please (c'mon L Boogie!)
And he winds up
He winds up
Knockin me, knockin me (uh huh)
Back down on my knees!
Ohh

(three time!)
It's been times when I didn't think
That I would last for long (huh)
But now we think we're bound to carry on

It's been a long (uh huh huh huh yea)
A long time comin
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh yes it will

This has been the Fugees
L Boogie
Prize Well

The Refugees are out!
(yes it will, yes it will, yes it will)
