Song:

Eugene's cool blues
Check it out here comes Eugene
With a hash smile on his face
He rolls around in his blue jeans
With a tooth brush in his guitar case
When I go with him,
Then I don't know where I'm going.
Check it out here comes the evil
With him you could sing a song
Hey man, here comes the evil
I'm sure you could make a hell of a row
When I go with him,
Then I don't know where I'm going.
Hey man, says the evil
I'm taking home my trusty steed
Hey man, says the evil stay high,
Say hi to the night for me
When I go with him,
Then I don't know where I'm going.
Check it out here comes Eugene
In a funky plastic form
Check it out here comes Eugene
And he's dying for a liquor store
When I go with him, t hen I don't know where I'm going.
Hey man, waddaya say
We drink a couple of hot shots of whatever.
Hey, and get a handle on that chick problem of yours.
Just sink me
