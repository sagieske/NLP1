Song:

All year long
We wait for sun
At the beach
We come undone

Heyyy, hello world
Hello sweet summer Cudder
Ain't nobody rowdy
The cops won't hound me
The women of the women
Love the Chucks I'm wearing
They slaves to my artistry
And can't stop staring
So nice, Swishers for the roll-up
The grape cigarillo
Little mama roll 'em good though
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout s**t
Everybody chillin' we ain't worried 'bout a thing

I understand life will be better
Lookin' at the ocean
Oh s**t this is way iller
Callin' my mama
I tell her not to worry
I'm a man in the wild
And the wild is the best
I digress,
This might just be hit or miss
My intentions all summer
Have certainly just been miss
Maintain, and keep my brain sane
Very little ragin'

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry
All year long
We wait for sun
At the beach

We come undone

All year long
We wait for sun
At the beach
We come undone

Hey the stars are gone
Everybody come on
Come on come one come all
Come one come all

Hey the stars are gone
Everybody come on
Come on come one come all
Come one come all

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry

Mmm aint worried bout a thang
Mmm give a damn we aint worried bout a thang
Aint worried bout a thang
Aint worried bout a thang
Everybody good we aint worried bout a thang
Everybody good we aint worried bout s**t

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry

All summer drinkin water
Trying to keep your eyes dry
Trying to keep your eyes dry
