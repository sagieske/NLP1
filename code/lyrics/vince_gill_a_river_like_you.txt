Song:

(feat. Jenny Gill)

A good woman's love is like a river
Runnin' through the heart of a man
If he gives her all he can give her
She'll be there at every bend
Other rivers I've crossed
A reflection was lost
In shallow waters left me blue
Girl I never came across a river like you

A river like you
Where your love runs so deep and true
A river like you
Like a waterfall fallin' into
A river like you

Well I spent all my time searchin'
Runnin' like the wayward wind
You ofound me desperately driftin'
You touched my heart and took me in

Now your love runs through me
And in your eyes I see
Reflections I never knew
Girl I'll always be sailin' on a river like you

A river like you
Where your love runs so deep and true
A river like you
It's like a waterfall fallin' into
A river like you

Now the rivers I've crossed
A reflection was lost
In shallow waters left me blue
Girl I'll always be sailin' on a river like you

A river like you
Where your love runs so deep and true
A river like you
It's like a waterfall fallin' into
A river like you
A river like you
