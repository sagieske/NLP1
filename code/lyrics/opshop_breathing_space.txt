Song:

I'm so sorry
We were getting so tired
And here I was off dreaming again
One day we'd see the light before it caught fire
One day we'd see the light before it caught fire

[Chorus:]
Don't give me breathing space
I said, don't you dare give me breathing space
We're so familiar here
We're so, so out of place, my love, oh
And I would rather be anywhere

She knows'
Oh-hoo'

Something's circling
I can feel the weight deep under our breath
Come hold my hand
Hold it as tight as you can
Hold it as tight as you can

Ho'

Don't give me breathing space
I said, don't you dare give me breathing space
We're so senseless here
We're so, so out of place, my love, oh
And I would rather be anywhere'

Anywhere'
Ooh'

[Instrumental]

Can we not see it
Can we not see it
Can we not see it through

We so defenceless here
We're so, so out of place, my love, oh
I would rather be anywhere
Anywhere

Ooh'
