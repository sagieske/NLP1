Song:

You're relying on the low
Against the dark
You must see what you want
Take the lust for your life
You'll hear the sound
It's the period of meditation
Raise your hand for the unity of steel

You'll regain sanity
Walk on the road to madness of fanatics
Take the lust for your life
Unify your mind
It's the period of meditation
Don't give up until you catch the truth

A major phase in your life is over
And you are entering another phase
It's your destiny
You've got to look at the other side
You will hear the call of cruel fate
There's no limit
And there's no choice

Fight against the world that banished you
You must see what you want
Take the lust for your life
You'll hear the sound
It's the period of meditation
Raise your hand for the unity of steel
