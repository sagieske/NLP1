Song:

What have I done?
With my heart on the floor
I must be out of my mind
To come back begging for more
But if you stay
If you just stay for the night
Swear that I'm yours
And I'll prove that I'm right
And these flies kept me sleeping
All my fears on their wings
And your grandfather clock is still ticking
But the chime never rings
And how long must I stay?
Will I lay by your side
Just to say that I'm yours
And you'll never be mine
With this love like a hole
Swallow my soul
Draggin me down
And there's blood on the covers
From the curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part in this
Why play hide and go seek?
Safe behind your veneer
Does it bury your burden baby?
Makes it all disappear
But those marks on your thighs
Don't they sting when you bleed?
It's the way that you are
And the way I'll forever be
With this love like a hole
Swallow my soul
Draggin me down
And there's blood on the covers
From the curses we uttered
To each other
You played your part
With this love like a hole
Swallowed my soul
Draggin me down
And I swear I'll stay with you
But I just can't forgive you
And I'll never be whole again
