Song:

This
It's gon be one hell of a night

I'm in my car
I'm in my car
She said she meet me at the bar
She at the bar
The vip is popping off
We f*****g star ymcmb

Girl you know that
When we do it
Girl you know
We do it right

We running from the A. M to the A. M
Threating everyday like the weekend
And we gon rock it out-No sleepin
Tell ya friends, tell ya friends

And we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn
No we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn

Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On
Untuil-Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On

Look!
Put it on me shawty
While we keep them glasses up
Yes we in the party
Put that molly keep the ashes up
She could hardly walk
With a donkey a**
Pass another cup
We could hardly talk
When I watch her past
And I aint even drunk
Play and catch up
Then I snatch her up and skin it on
And try ta pull it out
Right on the couch
Without no type of warning
Shawty keep it easy
Baby girl lets keep the liqour pouring
Pace it and be patient
We gon turn it up until the morning

We running from the A. M to the A. M
Threating everyday like the weekend
And we gon rock it out-No sleepin
Tell ya friends, tell ya friends

And we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn
No we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn

Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On
Untuil-Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On

You know we only got one lifetime
And I am making the most of mine
I am living a good life
I am having a good time
I am looking to go-Oh

And we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn
No we aint goin hone till the early morn
We’ll be going on till the break of dawn

Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On
Untuil-Until the break of dawn
Uh Uh On
On Uh Uh On
Until the break of dawn
