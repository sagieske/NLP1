Song:

You took, You take our sins away oh God
You give and gave Your life away for us
You came down, You saved us thru the cross
Our hearts are changed because of Your great love

You lived, You died, You said in three days You would rise
You did, You're alive
You rule, You reign, You said You're coming back again
I know You will and all the earth will sing Your praises

No one, No name can rise above You Lord
One hope, One life will shine forever more
Your kingdom in heaven and on earth
Your children stand to sing of Your great worth
