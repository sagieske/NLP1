Song:

[Verse:]
Don't f**k up yourself
This world not for us
All is divided,
All is sold out.

[Bridge:]
Hide your tears
Deep in your eyes
Watch the dawn
Of world demise
Hide your fear
It's not the end
But you can't stop
This decay dance

[Repeat:]
Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No will - no force
To stop this process
Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No fear, no fate
And no regrets

[Verse 2:]
Shut up your voice
Useless and weak
One man is zero
We are just a meat

[Bridge:]
Hide your tears
Deep in your eyes
Watch the dawn
Of world demise
Hide your fear
It's not the end
But you can't stop
This decay dance

[Repeat:]
Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No will - no force
To stop this process
Let's dance, my friend
This Decay Dance
No fear, no fate
And no regrets
