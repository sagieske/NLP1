Song:

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me, baby, won't you see through me
'Cause we're alone and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love with holding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now it's so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody, 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there is no space or time
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember, when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you

All alone

There's nobody there important to me
Baby, why won't you see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you
We were alone and I'm singing it for you, baby

Singing my song for you, singing this song for you
Singing it just for you, singing for you, singing for you
