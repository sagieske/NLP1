(Kangol Kid, Howie Tee, Full Force)
They say if you believe in fairy tales
Your love will never fail
If this myth is true
Sweetheart, you know what we should do...
Be like Alice in Wonderland,
Jack and Jill holdin' hands
And every afternoon
We can watch the cows jump over the moon
And if it happens to get cold
We can take a walk down the Yellow Brick Road
And if we run into Little Boo Peep
We can help her find the sheep...
A love that's full of fun and fantasy
The way our love will always be
This you won't regret
'Cause I'll be your Romeo you'll be my Juliet
Alice in Wonderland
Jack and Jill holdin' hands
And every afternoon
We can watch the cow jump over the moon
And if it happens to get cold
We can take a walk down the Yellow Brick Road
No tellin' what we'll find
But I know, at the end of the line
You'll be my Fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Be my fairy Tale Lover
Love with me alone... In our fairy tale own town
We'll have a house built outta stone
... And no wolf will blow it down
Rainbows in the sky...
And our dreams will get us by...
And our love would never die...
