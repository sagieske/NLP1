[Pre-Hook: Andre 3000]
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Benz, b***h
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Benz, b***h
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Benz, b***h
And I don't want no b***h who need to have that kind of friendship
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Lamb, ho
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Lamb, ho
I told that b***h I'on't give a f**k about a Lamb, ho
And I don't want no b***h who need that kind of n***a, scram, ho

[Hook: Future (Andre 3000) x2]
These cars don't mean s**t, these hoes don't mean s**t
These clothes don't mean s**t, this show don't mean s**t
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)
(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola)

[Verse: Future]
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
B***h you better cut it, shawty I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh you greedy in Tahiti, I just seen you flaunt
Aye tell that girl you 'bout to settle, [?]
Aye see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a n***a move a kilo
Oh you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio
Can't no Maybach prevent a n***a from makin' mula
Oh you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art
Backseat of the Benzo, the amg
Can you love a thug, is all make believe
Pure fantasy, I see through it easily
