Song:

From Delaware to Tennesse to Hawaii
From mountain tops
We have dreams from sea to shining sea
And now here we are

Faith hill
We have come
We have prevailed
Who so ever dreamed, this is your will
Here we are
Here we are

Seal (& faith hill)
At the dawn,
At the morning
Of a brand new day (a brand new day)
For all (for all)
In the spirit of our fathers

Seal, faith hill and
America
America
America is beautiful (beautiful, yes it is)
My America
Your America
Our America is beautiful

Seal and faith hill
And may God (may God)
Keep us together
Cause America (America)
Is beautiful (beautiful)

Bono

May liberty and justice ring for all
Let your dreams stand tall
May opportunities fall upon you
In the land of the free
Mary J. Blige
We have come
And we have prevailed
Who so ever dreamed, this is your will
And here we are
Here we are

Bono (& mary J. Blige)
At the stars
And the risen
Of a brand new day (of a brand new day)
For all (for all)
In the spirit of the fathers (spirit of the fathers)

All
America
America
America is beautiful (beautiful, yes it is)
My America
Your America
Our America is beautiful

America

America is beautiful (beautiful, yes it is)
My America
Your America
Our America is beautiful
