Song:

The smiling moon sez to me
There is no clash in my life
Make me weak and make me sick
And there's no time
And have no chance
And I walk into the silent

Thought keep inside not even concluded
The shadow hides eternity
The ruler of darkness distorted gear
And make it blur
And I can't see
And I walk into the silent
Walk into the silent

Reff:
What can I do now
There is no chance to proof
I just fall to the ground
But still I hope I can fly
