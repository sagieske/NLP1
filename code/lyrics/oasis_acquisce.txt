Song:

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE,

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WAKE THE THINGS THAT SLEEP INSIDE,
I ONLY WANNA SEE THE LIGHT THAT SHINES BEHIND YOUR EYES.

THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,
AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES THAT I WISH TO GO,
BUT EVERYTHINGS DEPENDENT OF THE WAY THE WIND MAY BLOW

CUZ WE NEED EACH OTHER,
IF WE BELIVE IN ONE ANOTHER,
AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA UNCOVER,
WHAT'S SLEEPIN IN OUR SOULS

CUZ WE NEED EACH OTHER,
IF WE BELIVE IN ONE ANOTHER,
AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA UNCOVER,
WHAT'S SLEEPIN IN OUR SOULS

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES ME FEEL ALIVE,
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WAKE THE THINGS THAT SLEEP INSIDE,
I ONLY WANNA SEE THE LIGHT THAT SHINES BEHIND YOUR EYES.

THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,
AND THERE ARE MANY PLACES THAT I WISH TO GO,
BUT EVERYTHINGS DEPENDENT OF THE WAY THE WIND MAY BLOW

CUZ WE NEED EACH OTHER,
IF WE BELIVE IN ONE ANOTHER,
AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA UNCOVER,
WHAT'S SLEEPIN IN OUR SOULS

CUZ WE NEED EACH OTHER,
IF WE BELIVE IN ONE ANOTHER,
AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA UNCOVER,
WHAT'S SLEEPIN IN OUR SOULS,
WHATS SLEEPIN IN OUR SOULS,
IT SLEEPS WITHIN OUR SOULS,
SLEPIN IN MY SOUL

BECAUSE WE NEED
YEAH WE NEED
BECASUE WE NEED
CUZ WE BELIEVE
