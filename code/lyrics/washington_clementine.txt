Song:

Take me out
Take me home
Take me anywhere
I walked a hundred miles
So I could give a dog a bone

I'm alright
I don't mind
I'm just running into something
Bigger than the something
Than I left behind

Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
Turn the water
Turn the water
Turn the water into holy water

You are restless
Very young
Got a message from your mother
Said to tell you she'll be
Coming 'round the mountain when she comes
She will be
Coming 'round the mountain when she comes

Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
Turn the water
Turn the water
Turn the water into holy water

Oh my darling
Oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
Turn the water
Turn the water
Turn the water into a little bit more time

Take me out
Take me home
Take me anywhere
I walked a hundred miles
So I could hear them play your song
On the radio

So I could hear them play your song
On the radio

So I could hear them play your song
On the radio
