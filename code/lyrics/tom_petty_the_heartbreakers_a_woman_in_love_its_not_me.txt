Song:

She laughed in my face, told me good-bye
Said, "Don't think about it, you can go crazy
Anything can happen, anything can end
Don't try to fight it, don't try to save me"

She's a woman in love
She's a woman in love
And he's going to break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

Well, all right, do what you want
Don't try to talk, don't say nothin'
She used to be the kind of woman, you have and you hold
She could understand the problem, she let the little things go

She's a woman in love
She's a woman in love
And he's going to break her heart to pieces
She don't wanna know
She's a woman in love, she can't let go

Time after time, night after night
She would look up at me and say she was lonely
I don't understand her [Incomprehensible] , I don't understand what she needed
I gave her everything, she threw it all away on nothin'

She's a woman in love
She's a woman in love
And he's going to break her heart to pieces
She don't want to see
She's a woman in love, but it's not me

She's a woman in love
