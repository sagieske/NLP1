Song:

First the tide rushes in
Plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very
Still once more

So I rush to your side
Like the oncoming tide
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide

At last, we're face to face
And as we kiss
Through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, you are real

Really mine in the rain
In the dark, in the sun

Like the tide at it's ebb
I'm at peace in the
Web of your arms

Ebb tide
