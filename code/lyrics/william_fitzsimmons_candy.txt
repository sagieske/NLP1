Song:

She faces me with constination
In her eyes
Though shes facing some direction
I can't find

In this darkness
With no color
Black and white
Sun's as dark as moonlight's shadow
In her mind

I can walk along this road
With out a guide
But I can't walk to your gates
Without her sigh

Incubation mean to save your fragile life
Oxegen that keeps me breathing
Took your sigh

I can walk down this road
Without a guide
But I can't walk to your gates
Without your sigh
I can walk down this road
Without a guide
But I can't walk to your gates
Without your sigh

Ah (Ah Ah)
Ah (Ah Ah)
Ah (Ah Ah)
