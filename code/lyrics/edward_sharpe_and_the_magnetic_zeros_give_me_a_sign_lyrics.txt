Song:

Oooh
If you are near
I want to know
I see your cold body
But I feel your soul
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Open the door
Creak the floor
Turn on the light
Give me a sign
Are you all right
If you are near
Then make it clear
Up to my mind and eyes
To again feel your love
If you are near
I want to know
My dearly departed
I can't let go
Bring me a sign
Bring me a sign
Then make it rain each year
The day that you died
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
I'll walk outside and I'll cry
Till it's light, I'm dying
To again feel love
Aaah
Lalala
Come as my kisser
Come as the rain
Come as my lover
Come back again
Come as my brother
Come as the sea
Come back my only one
Come back to me
Come back my mother
Come as my friend
Come back my only one
Come back again
Yeah yeah yeah
Come back again
Yeah yeah yeah
Come back my only one
Come back again
Come as my father (Don't you take me for her)
Come as the sea (Don't you take me for her)
Come back my only friend (Don't you take me for her memory)
Come back to me
Yeah
Only friend
Come back again
Come back my mother
Come back again
Come back my loving friend
Come back my friend
