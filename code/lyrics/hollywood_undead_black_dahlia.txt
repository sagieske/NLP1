Song:

(Johnny 3 Tears)
I loved you,
You made me,
Hate me.
You gave me,
Hate see?
It saved me,
And these tears are deadly.
You feel that?
I ripped that,
Everytime you tried to seal that.
You feel bad?
You feel sad?
I'm sorry, hell no f**k that!

It was my heart,
It was my life,
It was my start,
It was your knife.
This strife it dies,
This life and these lies.
And these lungs have sung,
This song for too long.
And it's true I hurt too,
Remember I loved you!

(Deuce)
And I've, lost it all,
Fell today,
It's all the same.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry no, no.

And I've, been abused,
I feel so used,
Because of you.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry, no.
No.

(J-Dog)
I wish I could I could have quit you.
I wish I never missed you,
And told you that I loved you,
Every time I f****d you.
The future that we both drew,
And all the s**t we've been through.

Obsessed with the thought of you,
The pain just grew and grew!
How could you do this to me?
Look at what I made for you.
It never was enough and the world is what I gave to you.
I used to be love struck,
Now I'm just f****d up.
Pull up my sleeve and,
See the pattern of my cuts!

(Deuce)
And I've, lost it all,
Fell today,
It's all the same.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry no, no.
And I've, been abused,
I feel so used,
Because of you.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry no.
No.

Seems like all we had,
Is over now, you left to rest.
And your tears are dried up now,
You just lay without a sound.
Seems like all we had,
Is over now, you left to rest.
And my fears are over now,
I can leave with my head down.

And I've, lost it all,
Fell today,
It's all the same.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry no, no.
And I've, been abused,
I feel so used,
Because of you.
I'm sorry, oh.
I'm sorry no.
No.
