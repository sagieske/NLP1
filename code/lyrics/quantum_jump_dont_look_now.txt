Song:

Oh my Lord, I wonder what she'll do
No-one told me she had some kind of
Voodoo
Don't know how she got this hold on me
Keep on feeling like I'm stuck in a movie

Don't look now but I think I'm going crazy
Don't know how but that lady shone her
Lovelight on me
Oh baby, let me be
I'm crazy - don't look now.

Oh my Lord, I wonder where I'll go
Who can tell me somewhere that lady
Don't know
Ain't no doctor who can ease my pain
Got me shaking like a tree in a hurricane

Don't look now... Etc.

Oh my Lord, I wonder how she knew
Did they tell her I had nowhere to run to
Ain't no use in going underground
Nothing for it but to give up and lie down

Don't look now... Etc
