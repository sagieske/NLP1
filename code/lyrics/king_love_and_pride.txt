Song:

That's what my heart yearns for now - love and pride.
That's what my heart yearns for now - love and pride.

Start your journey early or maybe later
Get your boots on

Look for rainbows
It's cloudy

Take your hairdryer
Blow them all away.

In you I've found a story I want to keep hearing.
In you I see all colours
Not just black or white.
In you I find a reason and hope for all dreamers

You are my fill
You're my supply of love and pride.
That's what my heart yearns for now - love and pride. .. .

Knowing
Sensing
Seeing
Eating
Sleeping
That's just being.
Touching
Testing
Loving
Wanting and taking

More love and more pride.
In you I've found a story I want to keep hearing. .. .

I'm taking it round the world - some love and pride.
That's what my heart yearns for now - love and pride. .. .
That's what my heart yeanis for now - love and pride. .. .
