Song:

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you, I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending
Unless, I could have one more chance to prove dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul
