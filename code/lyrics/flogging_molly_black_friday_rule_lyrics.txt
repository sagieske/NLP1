Song:

I want to believe in myself once again
So I dream of a man whose hopes never end
To kiss with a girl who's as lovely as you
I'd give you my heart, if you gave me the truth

And for every tear that is lost from an eye
I'd dig me a well where no man could destroy
I want to believe in a freedom that's bold
But all I remember is the freedom of old

Hey!

Well I lost me a wife, so I found me a plane
Flew all the way to California
This mess in my head is a mess getting out

Ya drink too much coffee, I drink too much stout
But after a while, when my mouth ain't so dry
I'll dance up a storm, sure life's looking fine
But as darkness falls, I return to my bed
Don't ask me more questions, don't f**k with my head

Cause I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe
Down in this world, down and almost broken
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule
As thousands they grieve, as the Black Friday rule

The buildings they shake but my heart did beats still
Oh mother of Jesus, I feel pretty I'll

I want to go home where my feet both feel safe
But there ain't no jobs in the old free state
So I must remain in my new adopted land
I'm doing the best, Hell I'm doin' all I can
So next time you see me, don't ask for my name (Yeah!)
For I am the King and sure long may I reign

Cause I've been down in this world, down and almost broken
Like thousands of people, left standing in their shoe

Down in this world, down and almost broken
As thousands they grieve as the Black Friday Rule

Down in this world, down and almost broken
As thousands they grieve as the Black Friday Rule

As thousands they grieve as the Black Friday Rule
