Song:

All hail Shadow!
Heroes rise again!
Obliterating everything that's not your friend!
Nothing can stop you now,
No ghost to bring you down!
When there's nothing left to lose, you win!

(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)
(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)

Suffer long and it will set you free,
Only through trial do we find the strength we need!
It's never over, just another day!
Of hope and tragedies, and everything that comes our way!

Determination of the strong!
Found the meaning that you searched for so long!

All hail Shadow!
Heroes rise again!
Obliterating everything that's not your friend!
Nothing can stop you now,
No ghost to bring you down!
When there's nothing left to lose, you win!

(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)
(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)

Somewhere in chaos we all find ourselves!
This destruction is the only tale we tell.
White is black, and black is white,
Right is wrong, and wrong is right!
Nothing ever fills this hole inside your heart!

Determination of the strong!
Found the meaning that you searched for so long!

All hail Shadow!
Heroes rise again!
Obliterating everything that's not your friend!
Nothing can stop you now,
No ghost to bring you down!
When there's nothing left to lose, you win!

=Instrumental=

All hail Shadow!
Heroes rise again!
Obliterating everything that's not your friend!
Nothing can stop you now,
No ghost to bring you down!
When there's nothing left to lose, you win!

(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)
(Bow your heads low, all hail Shadow!)
