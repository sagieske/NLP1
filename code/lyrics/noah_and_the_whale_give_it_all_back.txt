Song:

Oh well the world never seemed bigger
Than the summer of '98
Living out in the suburbs
Planning my escape
I grew my hair to my shoulders
Formed a band with a couple of friends
And we called ourselves The Devils Playhouse
Influences like Bruce and the band

And we'd sing and play
Simple three chord rock and roll
And miles away
The other kids would just grow old
But we're making our own way out
Yeah we're making our own way out

Well we'd practice every week in my bedroom
While my parents were working in town
And one morning in our school assembly
Played a cover of "Don't Let Me Down"
The performance was nervous and awkward
But the passion was real and profound
And the kids in the audience laughing
While the band just looked at the ground

But the victory
For the kids who believe in rock and roll
I know for me
That performance lives, it never grows old
But we're making our own way out
Yeah we're making our own way out

Well I'd give it all back just to do it again
Yeah I'd turn back time, be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time, be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time and be with my friends
Yeah I'd give it all back just to do it again
Turn back time, be with my friends
Tonight
