Song:

Makin' my way downtown, 
Walkin' fast, 
Faces pass and I'm homebound.

Starin' blankly ahead, 
Just makin' my way, 
Makin' my way through the crowd.

And I need you, 
And I miss you, 
And now I wonder... 

If I could fall into the sky, 
Do you think time
Would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you... 
Tonight.

It's always times like these
When I think of you, 
And wonder if you ever think of me.

'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong.
Livin' in your precious memories.

'Cause I need you, 
And I miss you, 
And now I wonder... 

If I could fall into the sky, 
Do you think time
Would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you... 
Tonight.

I, I, don't wanna let you know
I, I, drown in your memory.
I, I, don't wanna let this go.
I, I, don't.

Makin' my way downtown, 
Walkin' fast, 
Faces pass and I'm homebound.

Starin' blankly ahead, 
Just makin' my way, 
Makin' my way through the crowd.

And I still need you, 
And I still miss you, 
And now I wonder... 

If I could fall into the sky, 
Do you think time
Would pass... us by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you... 

Oh oh

If I could fall into the sky, 
Do you think time would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you.

If I could just hold you... 
Tonight.
