Song:

Let it snow!
Vaughn Monroe
Sammy Cahn, J. Styne (c) 1945

Oh, the weather outside is frightful, [F C7 F]
But the fire is so delightful, [F Abdim C7]
And since we've no place to go, [Gm D7 Gm]
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [C7 F]

It doesn't show signs of stopping, [F C7 F]
And I brought some corn for popping; [F Abdim C7]
The lights are turned way down low, [Gm D7 Gm]
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [C7 F]

When we finally kiss good night, [C]
How I'll hate going out in the storm; [Dm7 G7 C]
But if you really hold me tight, [C]
All the way home I'll be warm. [D7 G7 C7]

The fire is slowly dying, [F C7 F]
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing, [F Abdim C7]
But as long as you love me so. [Gm D7 Gm]
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [C7 F]
