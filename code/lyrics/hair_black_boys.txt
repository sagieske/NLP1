Song:

Black boys are delicious
Chocolate flavored love
Licorice lips like candy
Keep my cocoa handy

I have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love

Once I tried a diet of quiet, rest, no sweets
But I went nearly crazy and I went clearly crazy
Because I really craved for chocolate flavored treats

Black boys are nutritious
Black boys fill me up
Black boys are so damn yummy
They satisfy my tummy

I have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love

Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black, black
Black boys
