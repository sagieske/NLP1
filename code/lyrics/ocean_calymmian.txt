Song:

What have you done with me?
You ruined everything
And you don't even see
I still can't believe this is real
My mind plays tricks on me
Please wake me up and say it was just a bad dream
I can't talk
I can't think
I feel dead
All I see is red
I am sick
I can't get up
I see no way out
I need drugs
What have you done with me?
You ruined everything
I bet you don't even see
I want peace
Don't know where to start
I don't wanna feel like this
I'll cut out this heart
Feed it to the pigs
Salvation.
