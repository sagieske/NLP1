Song:

Galveston oh Galveston
I still hear your seawinds blowing
I still see her dark eyes glowing
She was 21 when I left Galveston

Galveston oh Galveston
I still hear your seawaves crashing
While I watch the cannon's flashing
I clean my gun and dream of Galveston

I still see her standing by the water
Standing there looking out to sea
And is she waiting there for me
On the beach where we used to run

Galveston oh Galveston
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch your seabirds flying in the sun
At Galveston at Galveston
