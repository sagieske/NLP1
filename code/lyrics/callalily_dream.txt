Song:

As I walked along the sky
Of my dream you came alive
And it feels you're made to change
My whole life
And I know you will be there
There for me to make me stare
And it will be always and
Forever in my dreams

Dream, it makes me change but not for real
'cause I only see you smiling
In my dreams, that's the only time
I make you feel
What I have for you is real

As I walked along the sky
Of my dream you came alive
And it feels you're made to change
My whole life
And I know you will be there
There for me to make me stare
And it will be always and
Forever in my dreams

Come to me and hold me in my dreams
Let me touch you for a while
And don't let me realize that I am dreaming
'cause i'll be missing you,
I'll be missing you?

As I ran along the sky
Full of dreams, hopes and lies
You just come to make me feel
That we're supposed to be together
And I know you will be there
There for me to make me stare
And it will be always and
Forever in my dreams

As I ran along the sky
Full of dreams, hopes and lies
You just come to make me feel
That we're supposed to be together
And I know you will be there
There for me to make me stare
And it will be always and
Forever in my dreams?

It's time to come around
It's time to wake up now
It's time to come around?

It's time to come around
It's time to wake up now
It's time to come around?
