Song:

I'm waiting for the night, drifting away
On the waves of my dreams, to another day
I'm standing on a hill, and beyond the clouds
The wind's blowing still and catching my doubts

I'm hunting all the night, the slave to my dream,
An illustrated sea descends in the steam.
We're playing for the vice, emotional games.
I'm turning off my eyes and hiding my shame.

A never ending dream, a dream of you,
I believe I received the sign of you,
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too,
As you do when I wanna be with you,
A never ending dream, a dream of you,
I believe I received the sign of you,
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too,
As you do when I wanna be with you.

I'm waiting for the night, drifting away,
On the waves of my dreams to another day.
I'm standing on a hill and beyond the clouds,
The wind's blowing still and catching my doubts.

I'm watching all the flowers dying away,
Enheated by the fire at the dawning day,
I'm waking up in spring and kissing your face,
A still unmoving thing, I feel your embrace.

A never ending dream(echo-echo)

A never ending dream, a dream of you,
I believe I received the sign of you,
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too,
As you do when I wanna to be with you,
A never ending dream, a dream of you,
I believe I received the sign of you,
Tonight I want to hide my feelings too,
As you do when I wanna be with you.

A never ending dream, a dream of you,
I believe I received the sign of you,
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too,
As you do when I wanna be with you.
