Song:

Pressure to drink
Has always been there
And to smoke and use drugs
But I don't care
I don't feel the pressure
Don't listen to those jerks
I'm straight because
For me it works
I'm straight-Not because it's cool
I'm straight-Not some fool
I'm straight-Because I want to be
I'm straight-Can't you f*****g see
Don't go to parties
To get high
Don't want to get drunk
Don't want to try
Won't smoke cigarettes
To look cool
Don't smoke pot
I don't care about the rule
I'm straight-Not because it's cool
I'm straight-Not some fool
I'm straight-Because I want to be
I'm straight-Can't you f*****g see
