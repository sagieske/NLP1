Song:

I came up through the trenches where
We only played for tips and alcohol
You find out what you're made of when there
Ain't no gold or platinum on the wall
And there's a few more like me who
Ain't of fightin' for the cause

[Chorus:]
Me and my band of brothers we got you covered
Out here on the honky tonk front lines
We're loaded up with country music we ain't afraid to use it
Even if we have to play all night
Well we ain't no rookies it's our third tour of duty but that's all right
Yeah that's all right
Me and my band of brothers got you covered
On the honky tonk front lines

From the bars of San Diego to the
County dair way up in Bangor Maine
We keep the tour bus rollin' just like it was
A big old Sherman tank
Like those who came before us
Owens, Haggard, Willie, Waylon, Jones and Hank
(and Johnny Cash)

[Repeat Chorus]

Well we ain't no rookies it's our third tour of duty
But that's all right yeah that's all right
Me and my band of brothers got you covered
On the honky tonk front lines

Me and my band of brothers got you covered
On the honky tonk front lines
