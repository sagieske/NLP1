Song:

I can't even think of one good reason
Why I'm always thinkin about leavin
It's not like everything's so horrible
Been together for a few years now
And you know all my ins and outs
But everything's way to comfortable

From the moment I wake
I plan my escape

I'm not scared
Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear
That I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe

Sometimes I wish you cheated on me
Then leavin here would be so easy
It's time to take a chance and give you up

In the morning I wake
And make my escape

I'm not scared
Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear
That I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe

I'm not scared
Cause I know there's something out there waiting for me
And I swear
That I'll find it someday
Just wait and see
I don't care
That you call me crazy
I can't stay cause I need room to breathe
There's nothing left to say
Better sorry than safe
Yeah
There's nothing left to say
