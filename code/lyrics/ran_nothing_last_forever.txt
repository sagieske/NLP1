Song:

Baby, I know that sometimes you don't get it
Why we're always torn apart
Now we don't want us to get separated
Because you're always in my heart

And if you love me baby, let's go crazy
Let's turn this world around
Oh, baby I'm your man and you're my lady
Loving you is what I do
Because of you I feel free now

Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'm gonna keep coming back...
To keep this love on the track, yeah
Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'll try
So hard
To keep you coming back for more

Baby if I die today
I want you to know that I love you all the way
So baby please I'm begging you to stay
Because baby, you're my shining star

Oh, baby I will hold you tight
I'll make you feel safe every time you're by my side
Don't hesitate because everything will be alright
Loving you is what I do
Because of you I feel free now

Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'm gonna keep coming back...
To keep this love on the track, yeah
Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'll try
So hard
To keep you coming back for more

Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'm gonna keep coming back
To keep this love on the track, yeah
Nothing last forever, but baby I...
I'll try, So hard
To keep you coming back for more
