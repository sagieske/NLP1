Song:

Take a look at me
Years behind me have made me disabled
My will and strength lives in me...
Iit was loud to keep me stable...
No matter what! No matter what!

Hear me pray for the pain and to suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad tone...
From now on there's a devil on my shoulder

Why I'm still here
I this godless scene going six feet under
She's the burning ground beneath my feet
For too long and I should tell her...

No matter what! No matter what!

Hear me pray for the pain and to suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad tone...
From now on there's a devil on my shoulder

Hear me pray for the pain and to suffer,
It's all a game we're destructive to each other
Life is short, an open chord, in a bad tone...
From now on no more for me to follow
No wrong or right there's no need to say things twice
No matter what, I'll survive with a devil on my, a devil on my shoulder...

No matter what! No matter what!
