Song:

Tonight is the one thing left
And I haven't said it yet, I'm falling
And the writings on the wall

Today was misery
And I just can't believe this happened
And I finally broke down
She held onto my heart
But now my only star is falling
It's burning to the ground

Now I'm crying out

Secret love, my escape
Take me far far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

You're all I've got right now
No one else figures out this feeling
And how lonely it can get
These words can cut right through
Cause all along I've knew you're sorry
But you haven't said it yet

But now I won't forget

Secret love, my escape
Take me far far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but here

When we're together
Thoughts of her disapear
If I fell to pieces
You'd heal this pain I feel

Secret love, my escape
Take me far far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer

Secret love, my escape
Take me far far away
Secret love, are you there
Will you answer my prayer
Please take me anywhere but here
Anywhere but her
