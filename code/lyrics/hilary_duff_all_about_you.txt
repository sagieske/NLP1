Song:

You could be my dirty secret
(I could be yours)
We could only be a rumor
(Never be sure)
You could meet me in the backseat
(Late night)
A ticket up in first class
(Mile high)

Cuz hey baby, baby you got me so
So good
Hey baby, baby I got it so
So bad

Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
Turn the lights down let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me but I'm all about you, you

I don't wanna keep a secret
(No no no more)
This is more than just a little thing, baby
(For sure)
I can't wait until the next time
(We meet)
Gonna kiss you in the daylight
Out on the beach

Cuz hey baby, baby you got me so
So good
Hey baby, baby I got it so
So bad

Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
Turn the lights down let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
(Think you're all about me but I'm all about you), you
Think you're all about me but I'm all about you

Midnight eyes
Oh you came as a surprise
You were right on time
Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you

Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you
(Think you're all about me, but I'm all about you)

Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
Turn the lights down let me show you it's true
Get a little taste of what I'm into
Think you're all about me but I'm all about you, you

Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
Think you're all about me but I'm all about you
