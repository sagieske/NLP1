Song:

Every Other Freckle

I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bend into you like a cat fits into a beanbag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal on top of I)
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
[?]

Devour me
New, new let the cover girls sing

All hand claps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that Annotatepapers up your room)
I wanna be every button you press
And all mouth fits around you
Yes I'm gonna run around you
Like a cat runs around a thousand patios
I'm gonna kiss you, like the sun browns you

Devour me
Devour me
If you really think that you could devour me me

[Outro:] x8
I want every other freckle
