Song:

All I want and need forever
Is you and me together
Lady you're an angel in my eyes
You're my spark of inspiration
You have won my dedication
All I want and need forever is you and I.

When I'm down and feel discouraged
You're always there to give me courage
Everyday you make me glad just to be alive
You're my companion when I'm lonely
You're the one and you're the only
Hand in hand we'll walk together side-by-side.

All I want and need forever
Is you and me together
Lady you're an angel in my eyes
You're my spark of inspiration
You have won my dedication
All I want and need forever is you and I.

You and I we have each other
To explore and to discover
Everything that came before left behind
You have chased away my sorrow
I look forward for tomorrow
Knowing we'll be together you and I.

All I want and need forever
Is you and me together
Lady you're an angel in my eyes
You're my spark of inspiration
You have won my dedication
All I want and need forever is you and I.

All I want and need forever
Is you and me together
Lady you're an angel in my eyes
You're my spark of inspiration
You have won my dedication
All I want and need forever is you and I...
