Song:

(nickolas ashford/valerie simpson)

If it didn't hurt so bad
If it didn't hurt so bad
Maybe I could cry

If I thought it was all a joke
And you were putting me on
If I could just make a wish
And this moment would be all gone
If I could see a trace of hope
Somewhere in your eyes
Maybe then I could do
A simple thing like cry

If it didn't hurt so bad
If it didn't hurt so bad
Maybe I could cry

Don't you know I plan to spend
Every moment of my life with you
Now you're trying to tell me
That my dreams just wont come true
Thanks for giving me a million reasons why
But it hurts too bad to do
A simple thing like cry

If I thought it was all a joke
And you were putting me on
If I could just make a wish
And this moment would be all gone
If I could see a trace of hope
Somewhere in your eyes
Maybe then I could do
A simple thing like cry

If it didn't hurt so bad
If it didn't hurt me so bad
Maybe I could
If it didn't hurt so bad
Maybe I could cry
I could cry, cry
If it didn't hurt me
If I didn't love you
Hurt me
