Song:

There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
