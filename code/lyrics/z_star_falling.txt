Song:

Falling to slow
Crying myself to sleep on your pillow
Feeling high and low
Running but knowing there's no place to hide anymore

All alone I see creepy crawlies
Indecisive little games on my mind
To keep my lover working overtime

Pressure undercover
Telling myself there can be no other
Empty paranoia
Running but knowing there's no place to hide anymore

My heart shuts tight its doors
Still my body clings to yours
My mind is left suspended in flight
Making decisions on my lovers rights

Falling falling

All alone I see creepy crawlies
Indecisive little games on my mind
To keep my lover working overtime
My heart shuts tight its doors
Still my body clings to yours
My mind is left suspended in flight
Making decisions on my lovers rights

Falling falling
