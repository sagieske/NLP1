Song:

She fell in love with a swan
Her eyes were filled with feathers
He filled her with song
In the Reedy River
In the Reedy River

She in her boat long hours
He in his royal plumage
She threw him some flowers
In the Reedy River
In the Reedy River

Black was the night and starry
She loosened up her garments
And let fall her hair
In the Reedy River
In the Reedy River

Sadly, they mourn and sigh
Whilst in evening twilight
Two swans glide and fly
O'er the Reedy River
O'er the Reedy River

She fell in love with a swan
