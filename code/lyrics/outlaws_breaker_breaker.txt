Song:

Breaker Breaker take me home!
You know the one I want to see

Gimme your north bound seven five, I been headed for that campin' town
South bound is my ride

Eight more hours I'll be shiftin' gears
Look over my shoulder
Guy, won't you lend me your ears?

It's been so long since I've seen my home
I've got to get on down that road tonight
The one I love is waitin' there for me
With open arms and love in her eyes

Seeing the days and the night pass me by
I've been seeing the road signs and white
Lines are in my eyes
Hands on the wheel and my radio on
This is pony boy breaker down and I'm goin' home

You know I've tried to make the best of it
But there's somethings a man's just got to do
The big ten wheels keep rollin' along
And I'll be there before the mornin' dew

Breaker Breaker take me home Clear the highway for me
Breaker Breaker take me home you the one I wanna see

Hearin' that old lonesome highway song
I been hearin' the diesel, hum she's runnin' again

Back on the road I got a heavy load
Lookin' over my shoulder now it's clear to L. A.
It'd been so long since I've seen my home
Got to get on down that road tonight
Freeways and highways and back roads and byways
Come on back you cotton picker you

Breaker Breaker take me home Clear the highway for me
Breaker Breaker take me home you the one I wanna see

Breaker Breaker take me home Clear the highway for me
Breaker Breaker take me home you the one I wanna see

Breaker Breaker take me home Clear the highway for me
