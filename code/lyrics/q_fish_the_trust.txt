Song:

They say: In god we trust
Believe him and you're allright

You told me that you need - much more time
To trust in me - but you'll never do

Something has happened with u in the past
Was it my fault? If not what's wrong?

Ref.:
Trust in me, c'mon honey trust in me
Don't put your head in the sand - so fast
Trust is everything - so don't give up -and trust!

2ndI'm not the bad man who has hurt you
Don't transfer the past in me

You shouldn't end something before it has begun
But you did - you're cowardly!

Every time the phone rings - I hope it's you
I can't stand it anymore - let the bell sing!

Ref.:
Trust in me, c'mon honey trust in me
Don't put your head in the sand - so fast
Trust is everything - so don't give up -and trust!


Bridge:

At the end of the game I'm standing here -
With the incredible nothing in my hands!

Was it my fault?
If not - tell my what was wrong?
If not - tell me why you were gone?


So what about staying with me?
So what about trusting in me?
So what about believing in me?

Ref.:
Trust in me, c'mon honey trust in me
Don't put your head in the sand - so fast
Trust is everything - so don't give up -and trust!

Ref.:
Trust in me, c'mon honey trust in me
Don't put your head in the sand - so fast
Trust is everything - so don't give up -and trust!
