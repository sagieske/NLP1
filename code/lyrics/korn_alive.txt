Song:

I cannot ever find a way
To throw these darkened thoughts away
Need no place to hide
It's thrown in my face everyday
Guess that's the price I have to pay
For what's inside my mind

Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive

I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I've cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I've died
Now I'm alive

Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive

Little things tempt me every day
Constant pain is how I like to play
Better not cross that line
Voices in my head help to foresee
It's something I can't throw away
What's inside my mind

I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I've cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I've died
Now I'm alive

I bide my time
I'm intertwined
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind
I bide my time
I'm intertwined
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind
(Feeling so alive)
I bide my time
I'm intertwined
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind
(Feeling so alive)
I bide my time
I'm intertwined
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind

Alive
Alive
Alive
Alive

I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I've cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I've died
Now I'm alive
