Song:

Carry on
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
And cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine,
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July.

You swore and said
"We are not,
We are not shining stars. "
This I know.
I never said we are.

Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back/

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone,
Carry on.
May your path be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground,
Carry on.

Carry on, carry on.

So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die,
All our neighbours and wives.

But I like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets.
I am not the ghost you want of me.

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone.
Carry on.
May your path be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground,
Carry on.

Woah!
My head is on fire
But my legs are fine,
'Cause, after all. They are mine.
Lay your clothes down on the floor,
Close the door,
Hold the phone.
Show me how.
No one's ever gonna stop us now.

'Cause we are,
We are shining stars,
We are invincible,
We are who we are.
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
Sun will come,
We will find our way home.

If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone,
Carry on.
May your path be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground,
Carry on.

Carry on, carry on
