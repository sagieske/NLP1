Song:

Any time at all 
Any time at all 
Any time at all,
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there

If you need somebody to love 
Just look into my eyes 
I'll be there to make you feel alright 
If you feellin' sorry and sad 
I'd really sympathize
Don't you feel sad, just call me tonight

Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there

If the sun had faded away 
I gotta make it shine 
There is nothing I won't do 
When you need a shoulder to cry on 
I hope it will me mine 
Just call me tonight, I'll come to you

Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there 
Yeah

Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there

Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
Anytime at all 
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there

Anytime at all 
All you gotta do is call and I'll be there
