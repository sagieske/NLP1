Song:

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard somebody whisper 'please adore me'
But when I looked, that moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
