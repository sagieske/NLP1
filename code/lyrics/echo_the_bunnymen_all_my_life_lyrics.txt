Song:

Oh how the times have changes us
Sure and now uncertain
Men not devils have claimed us
Purity deserting
Gods one miracle
Lost in circles

Chorus:
All my all my life
Revolves around
Laughter and crying
As my life turns
Round and round

Cannon fire burning
On the hillside
You and I are side by side
Listen
Tin soldiers playing our tune

[Chorus:]
And round

Songs for lifes lost lovers
Bitter sweet their healing
Their prayers prayed under covers
Need not kneeling
Gods one miracle
Moves in circles

[Chorus: X2]
And round
And round

Hearts of fire
Hearts of bone
Beating stronger
Beating home
Where there's wanting
There is need
Where there's having
There is greed

I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
Youre sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
Hes gonna pick the bones of you and me
You and me

Girl
I want the gold dust
In your fingers
And your klondike touch
Girl
I want your goldmine
As it shimmers
In your solemn eyes

I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
Youre sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
Licking the bones of you and me
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
Youre sailing out on a blue blue sea
Blue blue sea

I'm swimming out on the ocean
(blue blue ocean)
Youre sailing out on the sea
(blue blue sea)
(x 4)

(repeat about 14 times) blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
