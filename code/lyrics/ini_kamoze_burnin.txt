Song:

Like a fire, like a fire, like a fire, like a
Like a fire, like a fire, like a fire, like a

Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'
Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'

Could burn a hole in a big man's chest
I guess, when ya hot, ya just hot
When I'm in the cold and I need some rest
I love what ya got in your love pot

I don't pretend to be Romeo, no
I didn't rehearse no love line
When everyone tells me no, no, no, no, no
You give me all of your time, your time

Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'
Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'

Ya mommy and daddy would stomp and say
“Don't mix with Caribbean boys”
I am just gladdy when I hear you say
I bring ya comfort and joy

Just like a shower
You freshen me up every time
And every minute, every hour
You got me feeling so fine, so fine

Could burn a hole in a big man's chest
I guess, when ya hot, ya just hot
When I'm in the cold and I need some rest
I love what ya got in your love pot

I don't pretend to be Romeo, no
I didn't rehearse no love line
When everyone tells me no, no, no, no, no
You give me all of your time, your time

Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'
Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
Ya love is burnin'
Burnin', burnin', burnin' burnin'
