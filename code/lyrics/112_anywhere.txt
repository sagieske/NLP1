Song:

Here we are all alone
You and me,
Privacy
And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true
Can you hear?
She's calling me
Between your legs Loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway
Making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere...
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softfully pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...

I love the way your body feels
On top of mine so take your time
We got all night
Girl, you know I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby
Please don't stop I feel it now
You feel it, too
You're shivering
Ooh, you put me close to you
Just let it flow
There's no other place to go

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway
Making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere...
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softfully pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...

[Zane]
Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a n***a miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy thinkin' so much
Roll a Dutch,
Let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I pump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true playa's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cuz I'm hot now
You got me goin',
I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feenin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday
112...

(Repeat until songs fades)

We can make love in the bedroom
Floating on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway
Making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere...
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softfully pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...
