Song:

The first time I ever talked to you
My heart told me where a dream came true
And the first time you put your hand in mine
I was wishing it would last a lifetime

Chorus:
All I want for Christmas is my girl
(all I want for christmas. Christmas is my girl)
All I want for Chrismas is my girl

And we kept close under the mistletoe
As we watched the moon lit shadow in the snow
And it was then that I knew for sure
That I got just what I asked for.

All I want for Christmas is my girl
(all I want for christmas. Christmas is my girl)
All I want for Chrismas is my girl

I know I see angels
When I look in your eyes
When I wake Christmas day
You'll be my big surprise.

All I want for Christmas is my girl
(all I want for christmas. Christmas is my girl)
All I want for Chrismas is my girl

All I want for Christmas is my girl
(all I want for christmas. Christmas is my girl)
All I want for Chrismas is my girl

(Spoken)
Well, Ron, you know Christmas is all the same man.
Yeah, Mike. And I can't wait to the 25th because I know my mother bought me something very special.
Special? There's nothing more special than being under the Christmas tree with your family, opening gifts, spreading love.
That's a serious feeling.
Well fellas, let's remember that the spirit of Christmas is all about giving.
What do you think, Ralph?
What, who me, Rick? Well, the greatest gift I could ever have is to spend Christmas with my 2 favorite girls.
My mother and, of course, my candy girl!

All I want for Christmas is my girl
(all I want for christmas. Christmas is my girl)
All I want for Chrismas is my girl.
