Song:

Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop

Hello, stranger
It seems so good
To see you back again
How long has it been

It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

Oh, my, my, my, my, my
I'm so glad you stopped by
To say hello to me
Remember that's the way it used to be

It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop)
(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop)...

Oh, ooh, ooh
Yes, I'm so glad you're here again

Oh, if you're not gonna stay
Please don't tease me
Like you did before
Because I still love you so although

It seems like a mighty long time
(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby)
It seems like a mighty long time

(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop)
(Shoo bop, shoo bop, my baby
Shoo bop, shoo bop)...

Whoa, oh, oh, my, my, my, my
I'm so happy you're here again

Whoa, oh, seems like a mighty long time
It feels so good to have you back again
How long has it been
