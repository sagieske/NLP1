Song:

Hey, now, huh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, no, (Ow, now)
Hey, now, huh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, no

Fire (Uh) [Uh]
Fire (It's all about) [Uh, uh]
Fire (Woo, woo, woo)
Fire

The way you walk and talk really sets me off
To a fuller love, child, yes, it does, uh
The way you squeeze and tease, knocks to me my knees
'Cause I'm smokin', baby, baby

The way you swerve and curve, really wrecks my nerves
And I'm so excited, child [Yeah], woo, woo
The way you push, push let's me know that you're good
[You're gonna get your wish] Oh, yeah

Fire (What I said, child, ow)
Fire (Uh-huh)
Got me burnin', burnin', burnin'
Got me burnin', burnin', burnin' (Yeah)
Got me burnin', burnin', burnin' (Yeah)

Woo... Hoo... Hoo... Baby
Start burnin, burnin' baby
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh
Burnin, burnin' baby
Oh, baby

When you shake what you got, and girl, you've got a lot
You're really somethin', child, yes, you are
When you're hot you're hot, you really shoot your shot
You're dyn-o-mite, child, yeah

Well, I can tell by your game, you're gonna start a flame
Love, baby, baby
I'm not gon' choke from the smoke, got me tightenin' up my stroke
Do you feel it, girl, yeah
