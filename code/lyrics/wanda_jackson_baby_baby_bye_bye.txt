BABY BABY BYE BYE
Writers Jerry Lee Lewis, Hughie Piano Smith

Ev'rything I say, is wrong
Ev'ry'thing I do, goes wrong
My honey's tellin' me, 'So long'
What am I gonna do?
'Cause there's just no more dreams you dream
No more tears to cry-hi-hi
Nothin' left to say, but
Baby baby, bye bye
I once was your sweetheart
Now you found a new sweetheart
Hate to see ya break my heart
But if you must go, then go
'Cause there's just no more dreams to dream
No more tears to cry-hi-hi
Nothin' left to say but,
Baby baby, bye bye
('Cause there's just, no more dreams to dream)
(No more tears to cry)
(Nothin' left to say but)
(Baby baby, bye bye)
I'll do my best to, get by
I'll do my best to, get by
I'll love you'til I die
Here all left along
'Cause just no more dreams to dream
No more tears to cry-hi-hi
Nothin' left t say but,
Baby baby, bye bye
Baby baby, bye bye
