Song:

Holy one unsung, you are the scum of his philosophy
Will you ever learn that it is god who is the enemy?
Step across our line from the divine and twisted beaten path
Spewing forth in bullshit to your final fatal bleeding gasp
What you have to say about your lord don't mean a thing to me
Bash you f*****g head in with the book of his insanitiy

Who is your god?

Ram your religion so far up your a**
Till it becomes just a thing of the past
Trample the cross and you cave into hate
Bible basher I'm destroying your faith
Blasphemous and vicious as I'm ripping you from head to toe
There are those who wish you'd leave them the f**k alone
In your face I spit to contradict your lord's integrity
Time to admit, you are swimming in fantasy
In a fit of rate, Satanic ways you will be crucified
Bound and determined, your savior will die

Who is your god?

Stab your religion and leave it for dead
Crush your insides with a touch of Satan
You will succumb as did Adam and Eve
Bible basher, I destroy your belief
