Song:

Does anybody know where we really gonna go
I was wondering if it's god damned beautiful
You know the thing we cannot trade, forever wrong
[Repeat]

Solitude, my secret mood, Appalachian springs
On my things
Take a step to the left
Take a step to the right
I saw myself
And it wasn't quite right

Does anybody know where we really gonna go
I was looking for answers in the sun
And the feelings that a man can't control
And if the fire burn bright
In the deadly night
I said that I would never be on their side

Take a step to the left, take a step to the right
And I saw myself (and I give it to...)
And it wasn't quite right
[Repeat]

And I was waiting for...
Like a... Calling, singing in the sun
You said 'i remember '69'
I said 'ok'

Solitude, my secret mood, appalachian springs
On my things

Take a step to the left
Take a step to the right
I'm gonna keep it together
[Repeat]
