Song:

I'm mapping the routes to take
Preparing ways for quiet
And some proper conversation
When everything is seen so clearly now
I'd like to think
We can be honest with ourselves
Sleepless nights
When your memory consumed me
But they all have been long gone

I'm so much more
Than what you cared to see
You drove me away
Now I can move forward
Move forward

Missed chance and mistakes
How were we to know
That it would end when we began?
The times we've wasted
Will never return again
Sleepless nights
When your memory consumed me

I'm so much more
Than what you cared to see
You drove me away
Now I can move forward
Move forward

There's no time and no name
Here for us now
I'm sorry but we're much too late
[repeat 2x]

I'm so much more
Than what you cared to see
You drove me away
Now I can move forward
Move forward
[repeat 2x]

Move forward
