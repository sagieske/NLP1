Song:

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
The pop wars, [?] a hot boy
Is the fat boy, skinny ties
Don't empty mine n***a
Tall ceilings, chandeliers, I'm authentic
Gettin' long money, short winded
Lets go and get it n***a
Bang bang, b***h n****s caught drinkin' [?]
Roll that double lip, get shot and your finger waves
Twenty chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that base
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise
Chain swangin', name rangin'
Shots fired, same n***a
We movin' weight I'm at a different base
I'm out at eighty with my lady screamin' [?]
I'm hard to kill, Dade county, versace [?]
Fourteen [?] dollar bill
Only one man got the combination to the safe
Rammin [?] once, but I still

[Hook: Jay Z]
See them plaques on a n***a wall
We still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' off the start
We still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
We still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a n****s door
And we still movin' base

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Fallin' from the sky, the money bad the bigger
Angels tatted all on me, pray for a lord sinner
Rolls Royce Corniche, sweepin' me off my feet
New b*****s they by the fleet and we do em' all by the week
[?] just wanna chill, [?] just wanna meet
Weed man expnsive, three trips a week
Misses just wanna freak, feds stay up the street
Know they tellin' the [?] so we leak what we wanna leak
[?]
In the house of the lord, my n****s bearin' arms
His eyes wide, nose runny got what he fiendin' for
I'm movin' base, we outta state you know my speakers low
Put the pistol to your mouth now show me to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still movin' base

[Hook: Jay Z]
See them plaques on a n***a wall
We still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' off the start
We still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
We still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a n****s door
And we still movin' base

Verse 3: Rick Ross
You see the plaques on the wall but the yayo still in the spot
See me cousin off to college, I see that it costs alot
Tallons fillin' the jammy my hammy still in my heart
N****s playin' the corner, guess their playin' their part
[?] jump in the coupes, ladies stay on our feet
Your brother went to the duplex
My little dope from across the street
Hoodies come in all flavors, all black if you think you're sweet
[?] sellin' grenades by the box, you'll get it cheap
Schoolin' the little n****s, kilos all in the campus
A passport is necessary visa with all the [?]
I beef with all of the [?], headshots [?]
Br-80 just a plus don't mention the dust
Are-O-C double M kill anything we touch

[Hook: Jay Z]
See them plaques on a n***a wall
We still movin' base
Got them records jumpin' off the start
We still movin' base
Coppas tried to knock us off
We still movin' base
Haters throwin' shots through a n****s door
And we still movin' base
