Song:

There's a businessman, there's a widowed wife
A smiling face with a shattered life
A teenage girl with a choice to make
It's crowded here in church today
And the preacher says as the sermon ends
"Please close your eyes, bow your heads
Is there anyone in need of prayer,
Oh Jesus wants to meet you here"
Cause we all fall short, and we all have sinned
But when you let, God's grace break in
(Chorus)
It's Beautiful, Beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful
Well he'd never been to church before
But he came today as a last resort
His world was crashing in
And he was suffocating in his sin
But tears rolled down as hope rushed in
He closed his eyes, raised his hands
Worshipping the God who can
Bring him back to life again
(Chorus)And it's beautiful, beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful, beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful
Cause there's nothing more beautiful at all
Than when His sons and daughters call, broken
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Come as you are
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Come as you are
(Chorus)
Broken and beautiful, beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful, beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful
Come as you are
Broken and beautiful, beautiful
Come as you are
Surrender your heart
Broken and beautiful
Broken and beautiful
Broken and beautiful
Beautiful
