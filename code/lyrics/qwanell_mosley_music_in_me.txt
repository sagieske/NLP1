Song:

[Verse 1:]
I been waiting for this moment
All of my life
Twenty thousand fans a rage
Now it's time to hit the stage
Ever since my birth
My mama told me
My boy it is yo destiny
One day u'll make history

[Chorus:]
I'm right here I ain't goin no where
It's jus music in me
It's not hard to see
I ain't goin no where
I'm not scared I am well prepared
It is such a same what I'm gone do the game
I ain't goin no where

[Verse 2:]
Said everywhere I go
I get so much lovin
Whoever think that I would be
Living the life of a celebirty
I'm doin this for every boy and girl
(Who wants to make a mark in the world)
Nobody how hard it seems
Never give up on your dreams

[Chorus: x2]
I'm right here I ain't goin no where
It's jus music in me
It's not hard to see
I ain't goin no where
I'm not scared I am well prepared
It is such a same what I'm gone do the game
I ain't goin no where
