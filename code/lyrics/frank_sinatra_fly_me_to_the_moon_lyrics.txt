Song:

Fly me to the moon and
Let me play among those stars
Let me see what spring is like on
Jupiter and Mars
In other words,
Hold my handin other words,
Darlin kiss me
Fill my heart with song and
Dlet me sing for ever more
You are all I long for all I
Worship and adore
In other words,
Please be true
In other words,
I love you
