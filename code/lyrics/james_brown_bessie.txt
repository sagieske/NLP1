1-2-get down
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Look at me
You know what you see,
You see a bad mutha
Look at me
You know what you see,
You see a bad mutha
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Heh!
Heh! Told you so!
Told you so!
Havin fun, fooling around
Havin fun, got money to boot
Cause I paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
Caught, tracked
Turned my back uhh!
Paid the cost to be the boss
I'm a bad mutha
I'm a bad mutha
Head for the turn around
Head for the turn around
Told you so!
Paid the cost to be the boss...........
