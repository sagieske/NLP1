Song:

(Words by Van Halen)

Oh, yeah!
Alright

I don't care 'bout the way that you're treatin' me
And I ain't cryin' about the love I been payin' for
No I ain't bitchin' 'bout the things you been puttin' down
Yeah, in my street

Oh! I ain't goin' around sayin' things about you
Lord, I can't repeat

Hey, it ain't gonna change overnight, no
And it ain't goin' away without a fight, no!

Now I ain't sayin' that I'm never gonna beg you
Oh, baby come back
Right now baby, I don't really wanna see your face
Yeah, and that's a fact

Oh, I know honey all I know is what I'm feelin' inside
Right now baby I'm alone and I'm swallowing
Lord, a lot a' pride

And it ain't gonna change overnight, no
And it ain't goin' away without a fight
Yeah!

Livin' with the aftershock
I said, "My, my, my"
Well I never thought she'd walk
But now I'm livin' with the aftershock
And it ain't gonna change
It ain't goin' away, no

(Guitar Solo)

Yeah, she opened up my eyes (Seein' what I wanna see)
She came and took me by surprise (Showed me what I hadn't seen)

Yeah, yeah, livin' with the aftershock

(Guitar Solo)

Oh, yeah!
Alright

Watch it, watch it!

Yeah, yeah, livin' with the aftershock
I said, "My, my, my"
Baby, I never thought you would
Give in and learn it from the aftershock

And it ain't gonna change
It ain't goin' away
I said, "It ain't gonna change without a fight, no"

(Guitar Solo)

Livin' with the aftershock
I'm livin' with the aftershock
Ow!

Alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Never gonna chang
