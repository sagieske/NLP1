Song:

If you got jack in your cup,
Go raise it up!
If you ain't got enough,
Go fill it up!

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron,
I wanna girl on my lap and a jдgerbomb
So I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good then it can't be wrong
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
We be taking shots and if not you nerdy

We only leave a pre-party, go party some more
I'm already s**t faced before I walk in the door
This girl's rubbin on my leg, I never met her before
And now she's making her way down to my gentleman sword.

Might be the drugs talking or the shots of patron
But these b*****s look like models and they're ready to bone
I'll take 'em back to my parents house, we'll be home alone
Slapin' chicks and have 'em yelling like Macaulay Culkin.

She is tearing it up!
Yeah she's dancing her a** off!
This girl's like a Mac the way she's riding my laptop!
I'm trying to get my rocks off so don't try to cockblock!
I'll grab my sawed off and I'll blow your c*** off!

We drink so much
We get drunk for weeks
We drink so much goose,
We turning into geese
Me and my crew flap a V through the V. I. P.
These b*****s play my skin flute like they're Kenny G.

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron,
I wanna girl on my lap and a jдgerbomb
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good then it can't be wrong
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
We be taking shots and if not you nerdy

If you got jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got s**t, throw your hands up

Get gone with it, there's nothin' wrong with it
Take shots, don't stop, sing along with it
I wanna feel you bounce, girl go up and down
Take shots, won't stop till I'm passin' out

Girl get down, you can have more
And you can shake your hips around on my man sword
You're gonna have to rock this house, I'm your landlord
So let your sweat drip down on the dance floor

I ain't trying to go home with nalla nalla
We can hit the dance floor when you, wanna wanna.
Girl you know you feel in' me so, holla holla
Cause everyone compared to me is, nada nada.

Okay dawg this has gone on for way long
Can't quit my day job till I'm played on K-Rock
It's chaos, I'm in the club my shades on
And I'm about to smack that like I'm Akon

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron,
I wanna girl on my lap and a jдgerbomb
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I drink a fifth of Vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good then it can't be wrong
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
We be taking shots and if not you nerdy

If you got jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got s**t, throw your hands up

If you got jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got s**t, throw your hands up

I'm gonna chase this whiskey with Patron,
I wanna girl on my lap and a jдgerbomb
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
I'ma make it rain on the girl who serves me
I drink a fifth of vodka till it's gone
And if it feels so good then it can't be wrong
I'm comin' in hot, you heard me
We be taking shots and if not you nerdy

If you got jack in your cup, go raise it up
If you ain't got enough, go fill it up
If you had too much, don't throw it up
And if you ain't got s**t, throw your hands up
