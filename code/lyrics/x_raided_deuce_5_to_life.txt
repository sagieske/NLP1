Song:

[Intro:]
Yeah, X-Raided Locc
Back up in this b***h, n***a
I aint dead yet (dead yet)

[Verse:]
187 gang related, I'm accused
After every court date my face is on the news
They say I wrote a song about a murder that I committed
Maintain innocence, Nothin but coincidence
I admit, It looks shady from the outside lookin in
Situation is serious, So folks don't comprehend
17 years young back in '92
Facin 25 to life for somethin I didn't do
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part
And they gon' use the lyrics against me
When my trial gets ready to start
My words being misinterpreted
Nothin but the D. A. Tryin to prove premeditated
They got the Raided stuck, Majorly crossed up
The D. A. Got a f****d up witness and my lawyer is a drunk
Sittin in the county
It's three years already done went by
Pressuring my homies, tryin to get 'em to testifizzy
Snitching ain't no joke, It's hazardous to your health
Point one finger at me, You're pointing three back at yourself
Homies got convicted of murder in the first degree
And aint no doubt about it, They gone do much worse than me
Take me in the court room, In front of an all white jury
With the family lookin me with barely concealed fury
Lawyer standin next to me, prepared to represent
Help me get convicted cause to him
I'm guilty till proven innocent

[Hook:]
Why they wanna gimme 25 to life?
They tryin to gimme Deuce-5 to life
Why they wanna gimme 25 to life?
They tryin to gimme Deuce-5 to life
Why they wanna gimme Deuce-5 to life?
They wanna gimme Deuce-5 to life
Why they wanna gimme Deuce-5?

[Verse 2:]
Open up the front page of the Sacramento Bee
Read the article that Dan Mcgrath wrote about me
He has his own opinion, It's his job to write it
I say he's being biased and completely one sided
The media write their stories for the public to consume
And any chance I have of gettin a fair trial in Sac has been doomed
Any potential jurors mind is being contaminated
Readin all this bullshit that they write about X-Raided
I never told nobody to go out and kill somebody's folks
Blamin it all on me and the song I wrote is a complete joke
They're lookin for a motive, Searchin in the dark
Puttin a noose around my neck and a bullet through my heart
Just because I'm capable of killin don't mean I kill
Just because I'm capable of killin don't mean I will
Wish the family knew, Gotta find a way to make 'em feel me
I didn't do it but I gotta ride
Because I'm guilty till proven innocent

[Hook:]
Why they wanna gimme 25 to life?
They tryin to gimme Deuce-5 to life (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)
Why they wanna gimme 25 to life?
They tryin to gimme Deuce-5 to life (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)
Why they wanna gimme Deuce-5 to life?
They wanna gimme Deuce-5 to life (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)
Why they tryin gimme Deuce-5? (cuz I'm guilty till proven innocent)

[Verse 3:]
I'm knowin I'm gon' end up in the pen
Waitin on appeal, Hopin that I win
Me and Baby Regg fightin this f****d up case
Like Dooney and D-Dubb tryin to get these years erased
In Sac, It ain't no love when you from the Garden Blocc
Maniac, C-Money, Baby Snake and Lil' Venom already got washed
I'm tryin to keep my head up but my load is gettin heavy
Makes me want to do like Sicx, Take Tylenol and get it over with
But instead I just maintain, Do everythin to keep my composure
Representing the hood to the fullest, Ridin like a soldier
I told you fools the I ain't going out like the average
Didn't kill your folks but if you run up then I gotta locc up like a savage
On yo a**, b***h, Aint nothing personal thang, It's all about survival
And I'm going to be 125 years old before I die, If I can help it
You made your threats, I felt it but I aint dead yet
All you ni***z talkin about
What you're gon' do when you see me
I'll be on the weights, wearin state boots and my beanie
Wishin it didn't have to be this way but it's reality, I'm strapped
Based on the fact I'm guilty till proven innocent, n***a
