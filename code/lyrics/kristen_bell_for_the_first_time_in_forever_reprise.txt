Song:

Anna:
You don't have to protect me I'm not afraid
Please don't shut me out again, 
Please don't slam the door.
You don't have to keep your distance anymore.

Cause for the first time in forever, 
I finally understand.
For the first time in forever, 
We can fix this hand in hand

We can head down this mountain together, 
You don't have to live in fear.
Cause for the first time in forever, 
I will be right here

Elsa:
Anna, 
Please go back home, 
Your life awaits.
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates.

Anna:
Yeah, but

Elsa:
I know.

You mean well, 
But leave me be.
Yes I'm alone, 
But I'm alone and free.
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me.

Anna:
Actually we're not.

Elsa:
What do you you're not?

Anna:
I get the feeling you don't know.

Elsa:
What will I don't know?

Anna:
Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep, deep snow

Elsa:
What! 

Anna:
You've kind of set off an eternal winter... 
EVERYWHERE! 

Elsa:
Everywhere?

Anna:
Well, it's okay, 
You can just unfreeze it

Elsa:
No, I can't.
I I don't know how

Anna:
Sure you can! 
I know you can! 

Anna+Elsa:
Cause for the first time in forever
(I'm such a fool, I can't be free)
You don't have to be afraid
(No escape from the storm inside of me---)
We can work this out together
(I can't control the curse)
We'll reverse the storm you've made
(Anna, please, you'll only make it worse! )
Don't panic
(There's so much fear)
We'll make the sun shine bright
(You're not safe here)
We can face this thing together
NO! )
We can change this winter weather, 
And everything will be... 
(I CAN'T! )
