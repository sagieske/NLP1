Song:

Gather round everyone I'll telle you
It's time to help a friend
There's much love in the world
So share it all around
And together we'll win in the end

If we all lend a hand we'll make it
And say thanks for what we pray
Look around and you'll see
Such beauty in this life
So reach out and don't be afraid

Stay with me
There'll be guardian angel
Just have faith and you will see
That one day
You'll find your guardian angel
Who will guide you on your way

Let's stand tall and be united
What we need is our streghth and love
We can all live our lives
And give thanks to one above

Stay with me
There'll be guardian angel
Just have faith and you will see
That one day
You'll find your gauardian angel
Who will guide you on your way

Don't let your dreams fade away
Hold on and hear what I say

That someday
There'll be a guardian angel
Just have faith and you will see
That on day
You'll find your guardian angel waving back
Who will guide youon your way

Yes I know
There'll be gaurdian angel
So have faith it will come true
That one day
You'll find your guardian angel
Who will guide you on your way
