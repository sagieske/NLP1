Song:

You threw out the past
When you threw out what was mine
Throughout the years
It was hard to make it last, Anodyne, Anodyne

No sign of reconciliation
It's quarter past the end
Full moon from on high
Across the board we lose again, Anodyne, Anodyne

Anodyne
Tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore

Two fingers on the trigger
Can break the heart of any day
Foolish to believe
Turn out okay, Anodyne, Anodyne

Anodyne
You tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore

Anodyne
