Song:

I see you're takin' it awful hard
It all came around you like a house of cards
He's got a young thing, and she's calling him honey
But you got the house and all that alimony
You ain't lost nothing, honey, what you crying about?
Well, you ain't lost nothing that you can't do better without

You love a man that don't love you
You musta got a lot of abuse
Now don't get huffy, don't get mad
He might be the best thing you never had
Girl, you ain't lost nothing, honey, what you crying about?
Well, you ain't lost nothing that you can't do better without

Now don't you think it's time you thought of yourself?
After all, you still got your health
Hey, you're young and good looking, you can't beat that
Why you want a man that makes you feel so bad?
You ain't lost nothin', honey, what you crying about?
Girl, you ain't lost nothing you can't do better without
