Song:

The thought of this is killing me it's been on my mind,
Can't believe it's been right here after all this time,
And even though I love you I can't seem to find someone who cares the way you do,
You know I love the way we've always been nothing more than friends.
So why do I give every man the stand up,
Thought I was over this but once again I'm comparing you to him,
And I find that there's no you in him at matters,

Boy even though your my bestfriend,
I can't help it whenever I compare you to him,
It's like I always do this,
With every single man,
And I hate that I can't find,
Someone whos worth my time,
Just like my bestfriend,

And I know you hear me say this all the time,
I don't do relationships cause I'm on my grind,
But see your part of this,
Because I just can't find someone who knows me like you do,

Always brought out the good in me,
Don't know just what you see,
Whatever it is no other guy has even tried,
Remember when you left one day and turned around to say "your my bestfriend"
And right there you made me cry,

Even though your my bestfriend,
I can't help it whenever I compare you to him,
It's like I always do this,
With every single man,
And I hate that I can't find someone whos worth my time,
Just like my bestfriend,

I'm trying to let you know,
A part of me just can't let this go,
Never had a friend, one who understands,
With you it felt so free,
I don't know whatchu did,
But I that know whatever it is,
I'm so thankful for you,
I'm so grateful for you,

Even though the things I told you...
