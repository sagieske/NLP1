Song:

It's a rainy night in paris,
And the harbour lights are low.
He must leave his love in paris
Before the winter snow;

On a lonely street in paris
He held her close to say,
"we'll meet again in paris
When there are flowers on the champs-elysees. "

"how long" she said "how long,
And will your love be strong,
When you're across the sea,
Will your heart remember me? ... "

Then she gave him words to turn to,
When the winter nights were long,
"nous serons encore amoureux
Avec les couleurs du printemps... "

"and then" she said "and then,
Our love will grow again. "
Ah but in her eyes he sees
Her words of love are only words to please...

And now the lights of paris
Grow dim and fade away,
And I know by the light of paris
I will never see her again...
