Song:

After you've gone, and left me cryin'.
After you've gone, there's no denyin',
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad.
You'll miss the dearest pal you
Ever had.

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There come a time when you'll you regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely,
Your heart will break like mine,
And you'll want me only.
After you've gone,
After you've gone away.

Interlude:

After I'm gone, after we break up.
After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up.
You will find that you were blind,
To let somebody come and change your
Mind.

After the years we've been together,
Through joy and tears, all kinds of
Weather,
Someday, blue and downhearted,
You'll long to be with me,
Right back were you started.

After I'm gone, After I'm gone away.
