Song:

Well, clean up the dirt
There's just more dirt to clean up tomorrow
Make the beds you just have to make tomorrow
Wash the dishes, more to wash tomorrow
Make dinner, it just gets eaten. doesn't it?
The world keeps growing and feeding
Doesn't feed you, does it?

But, uh, how much can you take?
How much can you take before you snap?
How much can you take?
How much can you take?
How much can you take?
How much can you take before you snap?

Lying on your bed looking at the ceiling
Waiting for something to happen
And knowing all the time that you were meant
For something better.
Feeling it
Wanting it
But, uh, how much can you take?
How much can you take?
How much can you take before you snap?
