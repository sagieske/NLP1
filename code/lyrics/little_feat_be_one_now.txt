Song:

Fred Tackett, Lowell George
Well, I see you so far away
In my memory you will stay
There's a good life, a right way to go
But sometimes I feel so low

If you wanna love me, wanna be my friend
Be one now, be one now
And you say you need me and you want to share
Darlin', where's your love? Darlin', where?

Take a chance, you can't play it safe
Trust your soul, you won't lose your faith
Sometimes right but more times wrong
Wrong can turn out right they say
Just a different shade of gray

There's a moonrise in an eastern sky
Clouds they try but cannot hide
And the storm will cease and the sun will shine
Roll away for all mankind

Take a chance, you can't play it safe
Trust your soul, you won't lose your faith
Sometimes right but more times wrong
Wrong can turn out right they say
Just a different shade of gray

There's a way to a better life
Hesitate, you know you'll pay the price
If you ever slip and fall
There's a love here after all, a love here after al

It's a new day, never mind the past
Lay it down 'cause it won't last
And you say you need me and you say you care
Where's your love, darlin'? Oh, darlin', where?

Take a chance, you can't play it safe
Trust your soul, you won't lose your faith
Sometimes right but more times wrong
Wrong can turn out right they say
Just a different shade of gray

Take a chance, you can't play it safe
Trust your soul, you won't lose your faith
Sometimes right but more times wrong
Wrong can turn out right they say
Just a different shade of gray
