Song:

When I feel downhearted
When I'm feeling blue
When I'm low and lonely
Who do I turn to
It's you, always it's you

When I'm dreaming daydreams
Who comes into view
Who shares all my daydreams
Who makes them come true
It's you, always it's you

When I feel like smiling
You're the reason why
If I ever lost you
I'd cry and cry

Oh, hold me close, my true love
Kiss me tenderly
There is only one love
One alone for me
It's you, always it's you
Always it's you
