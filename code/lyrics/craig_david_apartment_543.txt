Oh... Oh... Ah... Yeah
Girl when you call me on the phone
Said your all alone
I said that you could drive by my way
Said I was the only one
Felt the time had come fot us to keep it real oh yeah
Catch me in apartment 5-4-3 yeah
Dial my number if you wanna just talk to me
999 in an emergency
I'll be everything you need satisfaction guaranteed
Simply you n't gotta go knowhere
Baby you can just stay right here
And you know any but a thing
There's no need to fear
I'm promising my dear oh yeah
Catch me in apartment 5-4-3

Dial my number if you wanna just talk to me
