Song:

Felt when I walked when I walked out the door
A new day will bring the peace I need
Oh baby I'm so sorry but I leak all the blood
From the past and now it turns into mud
I still feel the devil breaths in me
But this time I wil break him piece by piece

Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold

Sweet as it was not forever and never to close
I believe the pain was hunting me
For all the things that should not be
But I need a new love and for once I believe that it's her
I still feel the devil breaths in me
But this time I will break him piece by piece

Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the angels of tomorrow know
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold

You feel you die and then you get home
You pray just like I would slay
Time will heal all wounds

You feel you die and then you get home
You pray just like I would slay
Time will heal all wounds

You bleed you see and then you get home
But still I can speak the angels down from heaven where I slay

Felt when I walked when I walked out the door
A new day will bring the peace I need
Oh baby I'm so sorry but I leak all the blood
From the past and now it turns into mud
I still feel the devil breaths in me
But this time I wil break him piece by piece

Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold
