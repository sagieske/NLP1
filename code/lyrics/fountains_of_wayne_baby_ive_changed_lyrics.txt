Song:

She used to love me
She don't love me no more
I stepped over the line
Too many times
And she stepped out the door

Well Baby I've Changed
Won't you come back home
'Cause I've changed my wicked ways
And I'll never throw your mail away
And I won't tell you that your hair looks grey
And I'll let you listen to Sugar Ray
And I'll say I love you every day
'Cause it's true
Baby I do

Now I hope and I pray
I can turn this mess around
And I search for a way
To convince you to stay
And not just skip town

'Cause Baby I've Changed
Won't you come back home
'Cause I've changed my wicked ways
And I'll put away my socks and shoes
If the lights go out I'll change the fuse
And I'll let you listen to the blues
And I'll say I love you
Just because it's true
Baby I do
Baby I do
Baby I do
