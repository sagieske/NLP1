Song:

10.15
Saturday night
And the tap drips
Under the strip light
And I'm sitting
In the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip

Waiting
For the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering
Where she's been
And I'm crying
For yesterday
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drip drip

It's always the same
