Song:

[Verse 1]
Throw it right back just to put me right down
It'll put me right back where I'll never be found
Better drink it all down
Better drink it all down
Keep me in sight when you turn out the lights
When you open your eyes I'll be laying on the ground
Never making a sound
But baby you can still get down

[Chorus]
Get down with me
You down with me
Flopping on the floor like a fish outta water
Get down with me
You down with me
Blowing all my money before I even get it
Are you down with me
See behind the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping but you still
Get down with me
You down with me
Get down with me

[Verse 2]
Ice cream cone with a cherry ontop
With her cherry un-popped, so I guess I gotta
Leave her alone
Yea I'm gonna leave her alone
Meet me outside with the doors wide open
The door's wide open, but this one
Ill leave her alone too
Who am I going home to?

[Chorus]
Get down with me
You down with me
Flopping on the floor like a fish outta water
Get down with me
You down with me
Blowing all my money before I even get it
Are you down with me
See behind the doors I'm locking
Drinks keep dropping but you still
Get down with me
You down with me
Get down with me

[Verse 3]
Breaking down the doors I'm locking
The drinks keep dropping
The pills keep popping and the
Cops keep knocking on
And on, and on
