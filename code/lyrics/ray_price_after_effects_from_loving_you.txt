Song:

Nights are longer when you're blue and all alone
Seems eternity will past before the dawn
I tried everything but I can't seem to lose
All these after affects from loving you
Now I may tell myself I'll find an easy way to escape this misery from day to day
But my heart knows good and well uit's only you
Who can ease my troubled mind and arise the pain they find
Fropm the after affects from loving you
[ fiddle ]
Now I may tell myself...
