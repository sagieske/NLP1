Song:

Like an echo

I can't believe what I saw in you (in you)
For me to think that it was just us two (us two)
But you talking to her while she talking to him
Then it gets to his girl (girl), then it gets to my friend (friend)
She said, "Girl you just gotta let him go" (him go)
"I'm your best friend so I had to let you know" (you know)
I don't know where to start, it's like he breaks my heart
And through it all, I still can't deal with us being apart

Been in life eighteen years but cried a million tears
My mama told me, "Auburn, you're too young to deal with this"
She said, "You're just a kid," I tell her, "Yes, I know"
I think it's 'bout time that I let him go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

It's safe to say I know what's in store (in store)
You'll call my phone and I'll press ignore (ignore)
You roll up to my house (house), my brother says, "Get out" (out)
You're yelling, "Baby, please tell me, what's all of this about?"
But I know you're lying, telling me you're trying
I try to stay strong but inside I'm merely dying
Can't take the pain no more (more), I've been through this before (fore)
This time I'm ready to get over you and close the door

This time you've gone too far, don't want your gifts or cards
Time that I realize and accept you for who you are
I'm closing up my heart, not gonna see me cry
Won't be an echo when I say goodbye

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

It's clear you don't understand what I mean
(Why I'm on play you're on repeat)
There can be no you and me, oh
(Guess it's time that I let you know)
And even though I still love you
(I can't deal with all that you do)
I mean it when I say we're through
(And it's time that we let it go)

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go
It's time for me to let go
