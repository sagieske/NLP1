Song:

You took me runnin' up a wrong way street.
When we got there, you said, "can't you read ? "
I must be blind, but now and then I see
Another number where mine used to be.

Chorus:
You keep on changin' your face, like a chameleon.
You keep on changing your face like a chameleon.

I say what's up, and then you say it's down.
I see triangles, and you say it's round, round, round.
Saw an empty glass; you said it's full.
Lord, it's so hot, then you come on cool, cool.
