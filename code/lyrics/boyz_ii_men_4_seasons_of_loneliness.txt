Song:

I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try
When I get courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change

Chorus:
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the misteltoe
When springtime makes it's way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of the scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here it doesn't feel the same

Remember the nights when we closed our eyes
And vowed that you and I would be in love for all time
Anytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch 4 seasons change

Chorus

This loneliness
Has crushed my heart
Please let me love again
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or 4 seasons will bring the loneliness again

Chorus

Remember for warmth of days gone by
