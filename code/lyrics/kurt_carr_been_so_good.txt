Song:

He's been so good I just can't tell it all
He's been so good to me I just can't tell it all
He's done so much for me I just can't tell it all, oh
Been so good, done so much, I can't tell it all

He's been so good
He's been so good
I just gotta praise Him
Praise the Lord

He's been so good I just can't tell it all
He's been so good to me I just can't tell it all
Sometimes people tried to discourage me
But look at me tonight, I've got the victory
He's been so good
He's been so good
I just gotta praise Him

God is a good God, yes He is
God is a good God, yes He is, yes He is

I get joy when I think about
What He's done for me
I get joy when I think about
What He's done, what He's done for me

Been good to me
Really been good to me
Been good to me
Really been, really been good to me
