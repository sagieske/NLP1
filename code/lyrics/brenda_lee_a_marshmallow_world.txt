Song:

It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play
It's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
Now those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin hay
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
Oh, the world is a snowball; see how it grows
That's how it grows
Whenever it snows
The world is a snowball just for our soul
So get up and roll it along

It,s a yum-yummy world world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite guy
It's a sugar date when the spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world

(It's a marshmallow world in the winter)
(When the snow comes to cover the ground)
It's the time for play
It's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year round
(Those marshmallow clouds being friendly)
(In The arms of the evergreen trees)
And the sun is red like a pumpkin hay
It's shining so your nose won't freeze
Oh, the world is a snowball; see how it grows
That's how it grows
Whenever it snows
The world is a snowball just for our soul
So get up and roll it along

It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite guy
It's a sugar date when the spring is late
In winter, it's a marshmallow world

It's a marshmallow world
It's a snow-covered world
It's a yum-yummy world
It's a marshmallow world
It's a snow-covered... (song fades out)
