Song:

Wide eyes show white
White enough to shoot
But if you ain't got the strength to fight it
And you just can't hide it
And I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore
Ain't gonna open my eyes anymore

Pale faces burn.
I would've thought by now we'd learn
But every fool still waits their turn in
The rotisseries turning

Well I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore
I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore
I ain't gonna open my eyes anymore
