Song:

If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore.
You don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person.
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude.
But they'll call you a drunk as soon you down the first one.

If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat.
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack.
You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't, 
So you might as well just do whatever you want.

Chorus:
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys, 
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's something you're into.
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight, 
Roll up a joint, or don't. 
Just follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah.
Follow your arrow wherever it points.

If you don't go to church, you'll go to hell.
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son-of-a--
Can't win for losing, you'll just disappoint 'em, 
Just cause you can't beat 'em, don't mean you should join 'em.

Chorus:
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys, 
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's something you're into.
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight, 
Roll up a joint, or don't. 
Just follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah.
Follow your arrow wherever it points.

Say what you think. Love who you love.
Cause you just get so many trips round the sun.
Yeah, you only, only live once.

So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys, 
Or kiss lots of girls, if that's what you're into.
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight, 
Roll up a joint, I would.
And follow your arrow wherever it points, yeah.
Follow your arrow wherever it points.
