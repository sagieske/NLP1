Song:

Dear, your name here
It's been a long time, very long time
Since I've heard your voice
And I bet she never thought I was

So sorry, so
I've had a hard time, very hard time
Seeing less of you
I never thought you knew

So, can you see?
You're seeing less of me, darling
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating

And I'm as good as dead
And I'm as good as dead

Dear, I forgot your name again
Just picking up where I left off
This is the part where you leave me

So sorry, so
I've had a hard time, very hard time
Seeing less of you
I never thought you knew

So, can you see?
You're seeing less of me, darling
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating

So, can you see?
You're seeing less of me, darling
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating

And I'm as good as dead
And I'm as good as dead

This is all I have to say, to say, go

So, can you see?
You're seeing less of me, darling
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating

So, can you see?
You're seeing less of me, darling
And you're blind to the fact that my
Heart stopped beating
