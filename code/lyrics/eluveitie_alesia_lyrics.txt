Song:

The grass was as green as it always was that sinister day
The blackbirds sang their songs as they always did that black-letter day
We passed the great gate for the very last time
I did not look back, I knew we'd stay

I knew they they would not let us go leave the death strip
I saw the gleam in their eyes of fear and enslavement
Suffering from the crushing weight

I knelt ground take me home

Alesia, alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Ianotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

On that ground we cherished life
We embraced death
As the children's cries trailed off
Sob yielded deathly hush

The grass was as green as it always was that sinister day
As we walked the alleys like thousand times before
I knew we'd stay

Alesia, alisanos
Wake me when I'm gone
Ianotouta, eternity
Proclaim our barren sacrifice

Oudside Alesia
We offered a living sacrifice

Outside the doors of Alesia
Where our tears run dry
