Song:

The moon is high and the sunset fades
The lullabies have all been sung
Were tuckin in another day
And stars appear now one by one
But the stillness moves and the silence yields
And not a single beat is lost
You can hear the chorus in the fields
Taking up where we left off
And Your praise goes on, rising to Your throne
Where You guard us while we dream
Past the stars they fly, Your praises fill the sky
Til You wake us with the dawn
And Your praise goes on
Now bring your warmth, O morning sun
Chase the stars and the moon away
And wake us with your brightest song
And add our voice to your refrain
Now rise up everything that lives!
Flap your wings and leap for joy!
Oh forest lift your arms and sway!

Clap your hands you ocean waves!

And Your praise goes on, rising to Your throne
Where You bless our toil and play
Through the clouds they rise, Your praises fill the skies
Til the setting of the sun
And Your praise goes on
And when my final breath You lend
Ill thank You for the life You gave
But that wont mean the praises end
Cause I wont be silenced by the grave!
And Your praise goes on
Ill be runnin to Your throne
With every nation, tribe and tongue
To Your arms I'll fly
Ill gaze into Your eyes
Then I'll know as I am known
And Your praise goes on
And Your praise goes on
And Your praise goes on
