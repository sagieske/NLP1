Song:

I thought I had the best in life. I had friends and I had things.
I thought I was doing ok on my own until I lost it all.
I thought that I had real joy in possessions of this world
Until the day I met you and told me about

The Power of your love
The power of your grace,
The power of your nail scarred hands
Changed eternal fate.

The power of your blood
The power of your word
The power of your life in me
Makes me free today.

The power of your love
The power of your grace
The power of your nail scarred hands
Changed eternal fate.

The power of your blood
The power of your word
The power of your life in me
Makes me free today.

You came to earth so that I can be free.
Every burden I had you lifted off me.
You gave the ultimate sacrifice
You she'd your blood and gave me life.
Now all this pain my eyes can see my heart has turned
And it's chases after thee
So I denounce myself and things so I can be like you.

The power of your love
The power of your grace
The power of your nail scarred hands
Changed eternal fate.

The power of your blood
The power of your word
The power of your life in me
That makes me free today

The power of your blood (the power of your blood)
The power of your grace (the power of your grace)
The power of your nailed scarred hands (the power of your)
Changed eternal fate (sing it gently)

The power of your blood (the power of the blood)
The power of your word (the power of the word)
The power of your life in me (yea yea) x1
Makes me free today

Ooooooooooo
Whoa (Whoa Whoa)
Whoa (The power of your blood)
Whoa (The power of your grace)
Whoa (Whoa)
Whoa (Whoa)
Sing Whoa (The power of your blood)
Whoa (The power of your grace)
Whoa (Whoa)
Whoa (Whoa)
Whoa (The blood)
Whoa (Jesus)
Whoa (The Blood)
Whoa (Jesus)
