Song:

We know it's been time talking to you,
So we figure we lay it on you.
Let you know how we feel about, love.
Paint a pretty smile, each day
Lovin, is a blessing,
Never let it fade away.
It's all about love

Build yourself a true romance,
There's beauty that surround you
You deserve, just one more chance

My dear, my dear

Let the light snine, all through
Your mind feel your little, heart a glow.
Take the time, make up your mind
It's all about love

Talking to yourself is fine makes
You feel, much better,
Know just where to draw the line

My dear, my dear

Bound to fall in love one day
Surely and you need it,
Pretty smile will always say
It's all about love

We want to take this moment to run
Down a couple of things about things
We see everyday.

Now, I want you to stop whatever you're doing.
You're doing. Just stop.
You know, they say there' s beauty
In the eyes which I say is not the fact.
'Cause you are as beautiful as your
Thoughts, right on.

You know, for instance, we study all kin
Kinds of sciences, astrogy, mysticism,
Religion, so forth we did.
And like coming from here place, all these things help
Because if you're inside your inner self
Have mercy!

Now. There's an outer self we got to deal with
The one that likes to go to parties,
One that likes to dress up and be cool
And look pretty, all ego-trips avel all this.

Hear you all, I'm trying to tell you,
You gotta love you. And learn all the beautiful things around you,
Trees and birds. And if there ain't no beauty,
You got to make some beauty. Have mercy!
Listen to me, Yeah!
