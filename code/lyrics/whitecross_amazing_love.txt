Song:

My friend told me I got such nerve
Will I ever get what I deserve?
He said that I was no na√Øve
If I thought God's love was really free.

Oh what an amazing love
So much more than just enough
I found an amazing love,
Can't believe how it lifts me up

My friend was working overtime
He believed it was more of an uphill climb
Why did he try to undermine
He should have took to heart the bottom line.

Oh what an amazing love
So much more than just enough
I found an amazing love,
Can't believe how it lifts me up

Why do we hate? Why do we kill?
Why do we meet God in our games like angry children playing king of the hill?
Why do we lie? Why do we cheat?
