Song:

Started ou-out last night, I was thinkin' of days gone by-y
Of the times I've had, And the things that I've left behi-ind
Some change, some die, Still we manage to survi-I've
It's knowin' when and what to do-oo, It's up to you-ou
Don't know what's goin' on, I can't wait 'til

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-ai-ai-ain
One summer, remember the way-ay

Hauled down, turned around, Find myself facin' the wa-a-all
I think back to school, it's all the same, slightly different ru-you-ules
Ou-outside on your own, Watch yourself 'cause you're all alo-one
I know what's going on, I can't wait 'til

One summer, I'll find a way-ay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, never the sa-ha-a-ame

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think back not far, Drivin' down the beach in my car-ar-ar
Another pla-ace same time, Icky runs along a fine li-ine
Down there, no chance, He's trapped in a different roma-a-ance
He's life a fait accompli, He never di-id see-ee-ee

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, never the sa-ha-a-ame

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain
One summer, remember the way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-hai-ai-ain (fade)
