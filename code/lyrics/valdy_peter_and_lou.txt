Song:

Peter and Lou would skate
On winter's frozen lake
Circling around all their friends
Laughing wherever they went.

They're catching the mornin' plane
And sendin' the rest by train,
Hangin' their skates on the wall
Takin' their turn and that's all

With brushes & canvas & macrome handcrafts & Bessie Smith singin' the blues...
A chorus for Peter & Lou.

Now loneliness has a way
Of hangin' around all day
I'm standing alone on the ice
I'm wonderin' if maybe they've been right

So I'll catch the mornin' plane
Send all the rest by train
Leavin' the ice there to thaw
I'm takin' my turn and that's all.

And if I should miss them, I'll go back & listen to Bessie Smith singin' the blues
In a chorus for Peter & Lou

Oh, if I should miss them, I'll go back & listen to Bessie Smith singin' the blues
In a chorus for Peter & Lou
