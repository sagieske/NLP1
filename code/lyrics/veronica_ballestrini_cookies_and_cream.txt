Song:

Well some people may say it’s too soon,
But if you were the sun, I’d be the moon
Everyday reflecting your light,
If we were a question, the answer would be right
You got me falling like autumn,
But you catch me in your arms
I can be your Lois Lane, if you’ll be my Clark,
I don’t know how you do what you do
But I think that I’m in love with you…

Chorus
You got me laughing in my sleep
My hearts skipping to a brand new beat
I’m whistling a new tune
Finger snappin’ the groove,
You’re the peanut butter to my jelly
You got me wishing on shooting stars
Oh to be right where you are
I’m jonesing for your time
You the grapes to my wine
You got me under some sorta spell
And I can’t help myself, you got me sitting here
Watching my cookies and cream melt.

I’m not one to leave ice-cream in my bowl
But lately your love has left me full
Like sugar to a tooth you’re the only thing I crave
The realness to the truth
A current to a wave
You got me,
Hooked like a fish ya reeling me in,
I can be your Faith, if you’ll be my Tim.
I don’t know how you do what you do,
But I know that I’m in love with you…

Chorus

And I can’t even begin to describe what you’re doing to me
My only attempt to try is by way of simile.

Chorus
