I did it.
I did it, but I'm sorry.
Well, I'm really not that sorry.
Why are you staring at me like that?
Stop lookin at me like that! 
Okay, I did it. but I'm sorry.
But... I'm really not. well maybe, it's like... 
It's not you, it's just me.
You know I love you, baby.

He's just so tempting.
He's addicting.
I'm like an act, I can't help it. I keep goin back.

I'm a bad bad girl, I'd kiss that boy again.
He does things to me that I just can't explain
Yeah, sure. I know better. promised you I'd quit
Plese forgive me baby, for I have sinned.

Yeah. so I did it, 
But I'm sorry. well not... listen. here's my story.
It's just surfaced, it's so silly. he's so sexy
But, that's all really! 
See, the first time that I met him.
He was taken. so I took him.
Ever since then, when I see him... 
I try so hard to keep my distance but... 

He's just so tempting.
He's addicting.
I'm like an act, I can't help it. I keep goin back.

I'm a bad bad girl, I'd kiss that boy again.
He does things to me that I just can't explain
Yeah, sure. I know better. promised you I'd quit
Plese forgive me baby, for I have... 

I'm so sorry.
I'm not sorry.
I say I am, 
But really... 
Well... 

I'm a bad bad girl, I'd kiss that boy again.
He does things to me that I just can't explain
Yeah, sure. I know better. promised you I'd quit
Plese forgive me baby, that's just who I am.

I'm a bad bad girl, I'd kiss that boy again.
He does things to me that I just can't explain
Yeah, sure. I know better. promised you I'd quit
Plese forgive me baby, for I have... 

That's just who I am
I'm a bad bad girl.
