Song:

Some like a night at the movies
Some like a dance or a show
Some are content with an evening spent
Home by the radio

Some like to live for the moment
Some like to just reminisce
But whenever I have an evening to spend
Just give me one like this

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anything I'd rather do
This is a lovely way to spend an evening
Can't think of anyone as lovely as you

Bridge
A casual stroll through a garden
A kiss by a lazy lagoon
Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you

Catching a breath of moonlight
Humming our favorite tune

This is a lovely way to spend an evening
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
