[Chorus:]
And When They Hear The New Weezy All The Dough Boyz Go Crazy
And Watch The Dough Boyz Go Crazy
Weezy F. Ya Heard Yea I Do It For The Money Baby that's My Word
And When They Hear That New Weezy It Remind Them Of That Old Baby
93 94 Baby Yea The 4 Man Stunna Yea The Real Bird Man
I'm The Bird Man Jr O0o

(Verse1)
Yea I'm Trapped In The Game As A Yougin No Sistah No Brothaz
All I Had Was Some Money (Yea)
Learn How To Work The Stove And The Oven
In The Kitchen Trynna Make A 20 Turn In To A 100 (Yea)
The Pot Runnin Over Wit Hot Water
Throw A 8 Ball In It Watch It Come Back Harder (Harder)
The Come Back Kid Come Back Harder Yea
That's What They Screamin Loud As Eritha
And For Them Franklins We Pop At The Ceaser
Ridin Round Wit The Whole Block With The Speakers(Yea)
We In Miami We Stoppin At Teasers (Yea)
Have A Cigar And A Shot Of Teqila
I Use To Wear 2 Socks With My Snickers (Hey)
Back When I Was Puttin All My Rocks In My Snickers
Yea But Now I'm Rockin Ya Speakers
I'm All Grown Up Now I'm Rockin With Divas Yea
I Could Rock 'em To Sleep
But I Rather Be At Home Straight Rockin The Kibeler
I'm Up In Traffic Bobbin And Weavin
I'm In And Out Like p***y And p****
It's Lunch Time I'm A Cook Up Genious(Yea)
20 For Serina 10 For The Venus
Yea I Can Get Cha Higher Then A Tennis Skirt
Neva Filled Out A Application Got Plenty Worth

[Chorus:]
And When They Hear The New Weezy All The Dough Boyz Go Crazy
And Watch Da Dough Boyz Go Crazy
Weezy F. Ya Heard Yea I Do It For The Money Baby that's My Word
And When They Hear That New Weezy It Remind Dem Of That Old Baby
93 94 Baby Yea The 4 Man Stunna Yea The Real Bird Man
I'm The Bird Man Jr O0o

(Verse2)
I'm Lookin At 24 Bricks On Da Counter
I'll Make Them Dissapear In 24 Hours Gone (Yea)
I'm Really So Honest The Hot Boii Shyt it's Really So Behind Us
You On Some New Shyt You Niccas can't Find Us
That's Like Lookin In The Ruff For A Diamond
We Might Make A Nicca Up On Assignment
And For The Rest it's Like We Keep An Eye On Them
Bussiness Bad f**k you Pay Me
Oh You Had A Buyer f**k you Pay Me
I'm Might Run Through 80 In A Week
But I Can Make A Quarter Million Dollahz Off 1 Street
Top In The Game Off 1 Feet
Then I Landed On 2 And I Walked On Through
What Can You Do When You Living Like Me
Get Fly In The House Leave The Pimpin In The Street
As Quiet As A Mouse When You Dippin Through The Street
If You Lookin For Some Work Probably Run Into Me
And On The Humble The Number Still Cheap
But The Judge Got Numbers For A Nicca To Steep
Yea From A Youngin To A G
Weezy Baby From Bundle To A Key

[Chorus:]
And When They Hear The New Weezy All The Dough Boyz Go Crazy
And Watch Da Dough Boyz Go Crazy
Weezy F. Ya Heard Yea I Do It For The Money Baby that's My Word
And When They Hear That New Weezy It Remind Dem Of That Old Baby
93 94 Baby Yea The 4 Man Stunna Yea The Real Bird Man
I'm The Bird Man Jr O0o

(Verse3)
I Remember Had A Mouth Full A Gold Outta Control
And Jump In This Game Upon 1 Roll
And Got The Game Of The Floor Got The Game On The Low
Nicca Cookin This Rome Dough
Neva Thought When I See The Light I'll See The Limo Tints Grindin With The Street Strips
This The Family Homie Where G's Man Up With The Hammers Only
I'm Where The Danger B Nicca Where Eye Contact Will Get You Natural Beef b***h
Nicca Where Lil G'z Have Big Straps Back In The Game The G's Had The Big Macs Yea
Call Your National Guard Niccas Cuz We don't Give A f**k Well Pull Yo Car Nicca Shyt
And Have It G'd For Iced Up Loaded With b***h Niccas Stunna Islands Same Night
And I Remember When I 1st Saw Puff Nicca I Was In The Projects Camoflaged Up Nicca
Like f**k Them Shiners Suits We Hood Nicca White Tee's Is What We Do
Yea We Young And Tuff Nicca f**k The Other Foes There Weeds Is Standin Up
Nicca Jumped In The Same Lane Same Niccas All Shouting Out The Same Thang
Like 93 wasn't A Shame A Nicca Playin With Me And I'll Bust His Mother F**kin Brain

[Chorus:]
