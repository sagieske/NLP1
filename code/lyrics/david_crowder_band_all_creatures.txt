Song:

All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
O praise Him, alleluia

Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in Heaven along
O praise Him, alleluia

Thou rising moon in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him, alleluia

Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, three in One
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, three in One
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

O alleluia, alleluia
O alleluia, alleluia
O alleluia, alleluia
O alleluia, alleluia, alleluia

O alleluia, alleluia
O alleluia, alleluia
