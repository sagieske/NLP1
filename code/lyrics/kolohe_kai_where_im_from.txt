Song:

There's a place where I'm from
Where the people come
To be raised from the red dirt dust
And as everywhere I look there's a memory for talking the town filled with
Love and trust

Oh I can't hide, we got the clearest sky
Here in these islands we're up to each isle
Just feel the breeze
Lay beneath palm trees
And throw all your cares behind

Chorus:

Coz where I'm from there ain't no trouble
Yes! No stress in my sweet island bubble
And I know that I carry no frown
With this beauty all around is where I'm from
Where I'm from

Oh it feels so unreal just to sit right here
And look at all creation that won't disappear
Like the surf, and the sand
And the girls tryin' to get a nice sun tan
Island beauty fills it's land

The waters here can wash away your fear
There's no doubt why people wanna be here
This is the life, the life that you will find
Was waiting all along to give you peace of mind

(Repeat chorus)

New Zealand, Guam, Tahiti is the bomb
Australia, Oak Island, Hawaii's where I'm from
From the top to the bottom
Every island in between
We live a simple life you know exactly what I mean

But I sing now
"A, A" this island's takin' my breath away
"B, B" the surfin' makes me feel so free
"C, C" the people that I love
I think it's "D" all of the above
(Repeat)

(Repeat chorus 2x)
