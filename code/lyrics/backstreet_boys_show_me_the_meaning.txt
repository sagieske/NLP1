Song:

Show me the meaning of being lonely

Verse 1

So many words for the broken heart,
It's hard to see in a crimson love,
So hard to breath,
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done they tell me

Chorus
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart

Verse 2

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love
There's no control are you with me now
Your every wish will be done they tell me

Chorus
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart

There's nowhere to run I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body and soul
How can it be you're asking me to feel
Things you never show...
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I can't be there where you are

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
