Song:

There's a great American hero, we all look up to
When the times are hard and the chips are down
He knows just what to do
Now a cowboy's got a set of rules that he lives by day to day
If you ask for his advice, he'll more than likely say

If it's a fence, mend it, if it's a dollar bill, spend it
Before if burns a hole down in them jeans
It it's a load, truck it, if it's a punch, duck it
If she's a lady, treat her like a queen

That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
It's in the way he lives his life and the songs he sings
That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
He's got a simple solution to just about anything

If it's a job, do it, put your back in to it.
'Cause a little bit of dirt's gonna wash off in the rain
If it's a horse, ride it, if it hurts, hide it
Dust yourself off and get back on again

That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
It's in the way he lives his life and the songs he sings
That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
He's got a simple solution to just about anything

An old cowboy and a young buckaroo were workin', ridin' fence
The old hand was testin' the kid on his skill and common sense
He said, "Son, if you seen three men in a pick-up truck
Dressed alike from boot to hat
Could you tell which one was the real cowboy just from where he sat? "

The kid scratched his head awhile and then he said
"Well, there ain't no way to know"
The old hand grinned and then he said
"Kid, you've still got a ways to go

The real cowboy's the one in the middle
He ain't there just by fate
'Cause first he don't have to drive
And then he don't have to mess with the gate"

That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
It's in the way he lives his life and the songs he sings
That's cowboy logic, every cowboy's got it
He's got a simple solution to just about anything
He's got a simple solution to just about anything
