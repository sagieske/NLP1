All I need is a friend
Some one to give a helpin' hand
When I'm afraid in the night
Someone to squeeze me
And tell me it's alright
You know I worry such a lot
And I would give all I've got
Just to do have someone believe in me
Just to do that and put me
Back on evenly.
Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
I will love you till the end.
You make me feel
A stronger love than anyone
I've ever know
Oh, I need someone like you
You give me something so strong and true
Oh, Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
I will love you till the end.
Want you Baby, baby, baby be my friend
I will love you I will love you till the very end
Baby, baby, baby, baby be my friend
I will love you
I will love you till the very end.
Baby baby be my friend
I will love you till the very end
