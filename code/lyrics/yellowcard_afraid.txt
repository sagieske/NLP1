Song:

Lie in this empty bed
With this aching head
You left me here this morning
Now I can't remember why
I let you in again
To get under my skin
And every time you disappear
I remember

How I look for you
But I can't see your face
And then I hear you
The only thing you say...

I am afraid right now
I don't wanna let you down
And I am the one who can't be saved
The only thing I say
I am afraid right now
What if I can't get out?
What if I don't want to be saved?
This is me afraid

Now there's no place like home
To make me feel alone
I see you everywhere I am
And I remember how you ran out to hide
You kept me close behind
Following your every move so I remember

I look for you
But I can't see your face
And then I hear you
The only thing you say...

I am afraid right now
I don't wanna let you down
And I am the one who can't be saved
The only thing I say
I am afraid right now
What if I can't get out?
What if I don't want to be saved?
This is me afraid

I look for you
But I can't see your face
Then I hear you
The only thing you say is
Don't look for me
Cause you will never say
You won't hear me
You won't hear me

Why do we keep this up?
Why do we live like us?
When there is nothing left to save
Will you be afraid?

I am afraid right now
You already let me down
You are the one who can't be saved
If only I could say
I am afraid right now
You never will get out
You'll never let yourself be saved
You are so afraid
You are so afraid
