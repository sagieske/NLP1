Song:

Come go with Me behind the veil
Take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come go with me, behind the veil
Caus in his presence we'll prevail
There's a call to the remnant, you've been chosen to trevail
Hear the cry of the Spirit, to enter behind the veil
Come broken in spirit, purged in truth and Holiness
Bow down before His Glory, blood washed in righteousness

Come go with me behind the veil, come take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come go with me behind the veil, cause in His presence we'll prevail

Cause Satan has no power, no entrance behind the veil
All our fears are taken, peace and joy now prevail

So, come broken in Spirit purged in truth and Holiness,
Bow down before his Glory blood washed in righteousness

His Holiness is his essence,
His Glory fills this place,
His Power surrounds us,
His presence we embrace,
As we bow down and worship,
Jesus Christ our Sourverign Kin, and were eternally grateful,
He's the allowed us to enter in

Come go with me behind the veil, Just take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come on and go with me, behind the veil
Remember, because in his presence that's where we'll prevail
There's a call to his remnant, we've been chosen to trevail
Hear the cry of the Spirit to enter behind this veil
So come broken in Spirit Purged in truth and Hholiness,
Bow down before his glory, blood washed in righteousness

Come on and Go with me, go with me, behind the veil, take my hand and I'll lead you there

Come on and go with me (3x's)
Can't you hear the Spirit of the Lord cryin out?

Come on and go with me (2x's)
The Spirit in the back says come (2x's)
Come go with me behind the veil

It's a place, where Satan can't prevail
Ah, there's no entrance for Satan,
Behind the veil

So, come on and go with me
Come on and go with me (2x's)
Go with me (2x's)

The victory that yo are lookin for is behind the veil

Come, come, come, come, come, come, come

The Spirit of the Lord is begging you today
He's tellin you to come, come, come, come
The veil has been ripped
From the top to the bottom
The old tabernacle has been done away with,
Now you can come, come, come,

You can come without money,
You can come with out a price,
The Spirit and the Bride is sayin you can come

No demon can stand in your way, You can come
No Spirit can hinder your path, You can come
The Spirit of the Lord is callin to His remnant today

He's cryin out come on
And go with me
Come on
I've been waiting for you, to come and go with me
Hear my voice this morning, calling you to come and go with me
Bow down and worship me
Bow down in my presence
Himble yourself, under the mighty hand of God
And he will give you strength
He will give you a cure

You can enter in (2x's)
Bow down and worship me
Worship me (3x's)

Come on and go with me, behind the veil
Come on and worship me behind the veil

The flesh wanna stay in the outer court,
The Priest can only come in the inner court,
But only the Spirit can come behind the veil,
Only the blood washed in righteousness can come behind the veil,
Only the purged in Spirit can come behind the veil
I'm talkin to yo, come on
Let me wash your mind this morning
Hey, come on
Allow me to purify your heart today
Come on
Let me purge you with kyssop this morning,
Come on
Let me wash you clean,
Wash you clean (2x's)

Because my desire for you is to come behind the veil

Your part of the chosen remnant, that I desire to come

Come now, while the Spirit and the Bride is sayin come

Come now while I turn your heart to come

Come now while I cease the warfare in your mind to come

Everybody don't get the privledge to come in the presence of the Lord

My hands is upon your life (2x's)
That's why Satan can't destroy you (2x's)

Because I chose you,
Before the foundation of the world,
I chose you, to come

Your my chosen
You see, this thing that your going through,
This trial that your walkin through
It's not there to destroy you, but it's there to purify you,

So you can come
Oh, my child
Know that all things work together, for the good to them that love the Almighty God,
So come on and go with me behind the veil
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the Shadows of the Almighty (2x's)

You see behind the veil, Satan can't reach you
You see behind the veil, he can't even talk to you
You see behind the veil, no sickness can over take you
You see behind the veil, depression can't come your way
So why stay there?
Come on and go with me (2x's)
Come on (2x's)
Come on and go with me, and go with me

Behold the mysteries of the light
Behold the revelation of my word
For eyes have not seen, nor ears have heard, neither has it wntered into the hearts of men the things that I have for you
Behind the veil

(Holy Tongues)

No weapons that are formed against you will be able to prosper
Behind the veil

(Holy tongues)
