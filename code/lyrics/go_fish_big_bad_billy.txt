Song:

Big bad Billy had a belly ache
He had a bit of bad bread for dinner
Ever since then no food he'll take
So now Billy he's much thinner
He's got a brother named Ben with a baseball bat
He plays ball all day long
Everytime I see that boy
He's always singing his favorite song
And it goes....
[Chorus:] Oh me, oh my, My song has just begun
Oh me oh my and now my song is done
Nifty Nancy was a nanny
She sat a baby named Sue
They would cut out paper shapes
And stick em together with glue
When they were done they were so happy
With what they did that day
They'd join hands and do a little dance
And everyone heard them say...
[Chorus:]
There was a funky fish named Franky
He was fightin the furius flu
But there was no pharmacy in the ocean
So what could Franky do?
Meanwhile up above the water
There was a crazy cow named Curt
He would moo his song so loud
It would make your eardrums hurt
[Chorus:]
