[Chorus]
Call 911 it's An Emergency
Tell The Swat Team To Please Respond Wit Urgency
Cause Gucci Stole My Girl Grand Larceny
His Bars Too Hot That An Arsony
[Repeat 2x]

[Verse 1:]
I Walk In And Start Str8 Ballin, Ballin
Parodon Me Be I Just Came To Party, Party
Shawty Lookin At Me All Retarted, Tarted
I'm Standin In The Very Important, Portant
Overseas Kush Imported, Ported
One Hit Wonders can't Afford It, Ford It
Camera Phone it's Time To Take A Portrait, Portrait
Me And You Together that's Gorgeous, Gorgeous
She Like My Swag And Imma Record It, Cord It
She Said Her Ex Man Was To Boring, Boring
I'm The Doctor If You Got Insurance, Surance
First Get We'll Be Testin Your Endurance, Durance
I Got A Sick Side Effect You can't Cure It
I'll Have You Thinkin About Me 24/7
So If You Wanna Take A Flick Use Caution
Cause If You Legal And Single We Talkin

[Chorus]
Call 911 it's An Emergency
Tell The Swat Team To Please Respond Wit Urgency
