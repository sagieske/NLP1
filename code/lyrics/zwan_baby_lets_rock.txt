Song:

Baby, I'm the greatest thing you've got
In a good way I suppose
Exactly where you are is where I'm not
So from a lead balloon inside your room
I'll drop sparks
You can kick, you can cry, you can fuss
But let's rock

Baby, is there time for loves
So go and grab your brand new shoes
I've taken care of everything
And when I can't can't you know I'm tying knots
Baby, let's rock

Baby, I'm the greatest thing you've got
My rings are to set the stone
But every single wish is still a lie
So in my time machine
I'll adjust the scenes
Turn back your clocks
You can b***h, you can cry, you can moan
But let's rock

Baby, there's no time for loves
So go and grab your brand new shoes
I've taken care of everything
And when I can't you know I won't abuse
Baby, let's rock
Let's rock
Let's rock
Let's rock
Let's rock

I dream about you every night
And when I do you're holding me tight
I'd love somebody like you in my life
In my life

Baby, I'm the greatest thing you've got
In a good way I should hope
In a good way I suppose

Baby, I'm the greatest thing you've got
Baby, I'm the greatest thing you've got
I've taken care of everything
I've even gone and changed all the locks
Baby, let's rock
Let's rock
