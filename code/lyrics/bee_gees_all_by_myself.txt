Song:

I know my street , that's where I live
I never take , I always give
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself

My car aint big , I can't go fast
And evry drink I takes the last
Im always tryin to save my health
I live my life all by myself

Evrything I have I own and no one lives on me
Im a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
Cause Im the one whos sitting there
And I aint neve seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

My car aint big , I can't go fast
And evry drink I takes the last
Im always tryin to save my health
I live my life all by myself

Evrything I have I own and no one lives on me
Im a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
Cause Im the one whos sitting there
And I aint never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

I live my life all by myself
