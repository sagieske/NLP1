Song:

Rust on the lock
Dust on the floor
It's been too long
To know what's in store
Pieces of the past
Memories to explore
All that's left behind
Is what we knew before

And all we thought would be there
Might not be around anymore

And though we try
To stand there and ignore
What lies behind the door
We'll take our fears
And shake them to the core
As we reach out for
Something more

With a canon's cry
The bombs, they soar
Nothing left to hear
But the sounds of war
Darkness falls
While the echoes roar
At the end of time
A new life is born

We never thought we'd be here
Afraid of an open door
'Cause all we thought would be there
Might not be around anymore

Now that the tides
Have burned up all the shores
And the sky is torn
Though all our fears
Shake us to the core
Still we reach out for
Something more

But all we'll find was not there before
We went inside and closed the cellar door
All this time we've heard nothing more
Since we went inside and closed the cellar door
And all we'll find was not there before
We went inside and closed the cellar door
All this time we've heard nothing more
We all went in to hide
But now it seems it's time
We need to step outside
The cellar door
