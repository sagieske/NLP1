Song:

Going to school she learned to read and write
So much is new and life's full of wrong and right
Homework is done life has just begun
Hello world here's daddy's girl
Waking up early morning living in her own place
Taking a shower staring in the mirror at a tired face
Something for breakfast doing her face
Feeding her pet just like every other day
Still she isn't knowing when she's locking the door and going to her work
That in the morning next day she won't sleep alone
Later on in the evening she'll be riding on a feeling
Still she's somehow gonna be needing just a beer more or two
Daddy's girl, here's daddy's little girl
Daddy's girl, here's daddy's little girl
Party and music feels like this night could last a lifetime
Ain't gonna lose this feeling tonight she'll leave it all behind
A kiss and a hug from one of those guys
But she leaves with another in a cab in the night
Unlocking the door she's weary she can feel his heavy breathin'
Not too sure if she's still playin' a game or if she really feels like screwing
Is this really loving she is feeling really nothing
Still she is letting him proceed with whatever that is he is doing
Daddy's girl...
A kiss and a hug from one of those guys
But she leaves with another in a cab in the night
Who thinks of protection or the choice of rejection
When he is just about all done and her head is dizzy from all the free beers
Daddy's girl...
