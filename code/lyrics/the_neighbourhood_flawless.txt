Song:

She planned ahead for a year.
He said let's play it by ear.
She didn't want him to run.
He didn't want her to fear.
Nobody said it'd be easy.
They knew it was rough but tough luck.
I fell in love today.
There aren't any words that you can say,
That could ever get my mind to change.
She's enough for me.
She's in love with me.

You're a doll, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.
The only flaw, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.

So, she put his heart in a bag.
He wouldn't ask for it back.
He didn't want her to cry.
She didn't want to be sad.
She said you'd better not leave me.
This shit'll be f****d for days, and weeks, and months, but...
I fell in love today.
There aren't any words that you can say,
That could ever get my mind to change.
She's enough for me.
She's in love with me.

You're a doll, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.
The only flaw, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.

If I add it all up, I couldn't find it.
The problem with love, is I'm blinded by...
It rattles my lungs, but my mind is
Tangled between your little flaws.
Your flaws.
Your flaws.
Your flaws.

You're a doll, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.
The only flaw, you are flawless.
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us.
I just can't wait for love.
Wait for love.
I won't wait for love.
Wait for love.
I won't wait for love.
Wait for love.
