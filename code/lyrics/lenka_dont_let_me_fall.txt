Song:

Underneath the moon,
Underneath the stars
Heres a little heart for you
Up above the world,
Up above it all
Heres a hand to hold on to

But if I should break,
If I should fall away
What am I to do?
I need someone to take,
A little of the weight
Or I'll fall through

You're just the one
That I've been waiting for
I'll give you
All that I have
To give and more
But don't let me fall

Take a little time,
Walk a little line
Got the balance right
Give a little love,
Gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight

We will be alright,
I'll be by your side
I wont let you down
But I gotta know,
No matter how things go
That you will be alright

You're just the one
That I've been waiting for
I'll give you all
That I have
To give and more
But don't let me fall

Underneath the moon,
Underneath the stars
Heres a little heart for you
Up above the world,
Up above it all
Heres a hand to hold on to

Your just the one
That I've been waiting for
I'll give you
All that I have
To give and more
But don't let me fall

You'll be the one
That I'll love forever more
I'll be here holding you
High above it all
But don't let me fall
