Song:

Something’s wrong and I can feel it
And if the surface tempt then breaks then we will drown her in it all
’cause you can’t look me in the eye anymore
But if you do it’s clear inside you’re fighting in the wood.

Pre Chorus:
‘Cause you can’t hide, exchange the night
And I come take the words you cannot say
So hush now and don’t cry, 
Mistakes are part of life.

Chorus:
I wasn’t born yesterday
And I see it on your face, 
I wasn’t born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore.
You took my heart and now is broke again.

So take your please by the corn now, 
So say a word around my Gordon Gordon Gordon... 
I’ll stay cool until you walk out
But when you’re gone I’ll lie here hold me that I will not drown

Pre Chorus:
‘Cause you can’t hide, exchange the night
And I come take the words you cannot say
So hush now and don’t cry, 
Mistakes are part of life.

Chorus:
I wasn’t born yesterday
And I see it on your face, 
I wasn’t born yesterday, 
And I am not your baby anymore.
You took my heart and now is broke again.

I ain’t your baby anymore
Don’t call me baby
Don’t say a word because I know
Don’t call me baby
I ain’t your baby anymore
Don’t call me baby
So save the word because I know
Don’t call me baby
