Song:

I'd love to make you mine
'Cause it's the only way to hold you
In my wild imagination
Still don't know how
To grab a chance and spend some time
In just a simple conversation

Refrain:
Just give it a try
Though I'm like chasing rainbows in the sky
I waanna hold you in my dreams
And make believe that it's true
Although I know, I know that it is impossible to do
Cause your a star
People love you as you are
You're a million miles away from me

Wished that you were here
Cause it's illusions every time you're close to me
And sing my love song
And it's the only way
I could tell, the whole world(I love you)
Although your a million miles away

Just give it a try
Though I'm like chasing rainbow in the sky
I wanna hold you in my dreams
And make believe that it's true
Although I know, I know that it's impossible to do
Cause your a star
Your a star
Your a star

Just give it a try
Though I'm like chasing rainbow in the sky
I wanna hold you in my dreams
And make believe that it's true
Although I know, I know that it's impossible to do
Cause your a star
Your a star
Your a star
Million miles away from me
