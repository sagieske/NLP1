Song:

Turn the lights off!
In the middle of the bedroom,
The kitchen or the hallway,
Just... And a little bit of foreplay
... Just tell me what you're feeling,
Cause is always the right time for love!
Sometimes you gotta do it, do it

Don't talk too much just kiss and touch,
We gotta do it, do it
All day like the radio!

Chorus:
So turn me on, keep me pumping,
Like all the things...
Boy you ain't got nothing wrong!
Making love, sweet love, we don't need nothing,
Just turn the music on
And I'll be your favorite song!

One in a round,
We're having some fun in the bedroom
All day and all the night! (x2)
Turn the lights on!

It's going down like a basement,
I love it when the beat drop,
I'm sick of being patience,
I'm screaming when the beat stops!
Did you wanna do it...
Just catch you in a...
I'm giving you my...
You look s***...

You gotta do it!
Don't talk too much just kiss and touch,
We gotta do it, do it
All day like the radio!

Chorus:
So turn me on, keep me pumping,
Like all the things...
Boy you ain't got nothing wrong!
Making love, sweet love, we don't need nothing,
Just turn the music on
And I'll be your favorite song!

One in a round,
We're having some fun in the bedroom
All day and all the night!

I don't mean to impose, but what the clothes for?
This is a bedroom and that's the close door,
And I ain't trying to flex, but I'll be so yours,
You'll be my lioness, and we can go roll.
Neah, I'm just... It's first class...
Can't you sit and stay bye,
... The only one go round,
You need one more round,
Left hand full of...
Cheek in my right palm,
Type of s**t you can put your life on!
Love like the... With the lights on,
Even if they're off, you can still feel the...

Chorus: (x2)
So turn me on, keep me pumping,
Like all the things...
Boy you ain't got nothing wrong!
Making love, sweet love, we don't need nothing,
Just turn the music on
And I'll be your favorite song!

One in a round,
We're having some fun in the bedroom
All day and all the night! (x2)
Turn the lights on
