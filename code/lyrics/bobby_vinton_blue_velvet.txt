Song:

Blue velvet wowwow
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light from the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender size
Love was ours

Eyes love I held tightly
Feelin' the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

She wore blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be...
