Song:

Be my lady
Come to me and take my hand
And Be my lady
Truly I must let you know
That I'm in love with you
All I want is you
How I need you
So please...

Be my lady
Maybe you could lose the pain
If you just tell me
Say the words you long to whisper
That I want to hear
Somethings on your mind
Is it hidden in your smile

Be My Lady
Just forget the past it's time to mend your broken heart
No walls divide us now
So dry the tears in your eyes
Nothing can stop us now
I'll give you all I have

Be My Lady
You're the one that I adore
So please believe me
I could never find the courage
To resist your charm
Nothing's more divine
Than each moment
You are mine

Be My Lady
Just forget the past
It's time to mend your broken heart
No walls divide us now
So dry the tears in your eyes
Nothing can stop us now
I'll give you all I have

Be My Lady
Let the sun shine through heart
And make a brand new start
Stay with me each night and day
Through the rest of my life
Just like a work of art
My love will last until forever

Just like a work of art
My love will last forever
