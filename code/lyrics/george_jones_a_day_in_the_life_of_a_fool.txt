Song:

Off to work with no kiss of goodbye
Wear a smile on my face but I lied
Cup of coffee at the corner cafe
Catch the bus, read the news on my way
Those emotions the whole mornin' through
Start a day in the life of a fool.

Sometimes I dial our number in hopes you return
But there's never an answer, guess I'll never learn.
Hurry home, as tomorrow is through
Check the mail box no letter from you
Then I rush up the stairs to my memories, again
That's the day in the life of a fool.

Yes, I rush up the stairs to my memories of you
That's the day in the life of a fool...
