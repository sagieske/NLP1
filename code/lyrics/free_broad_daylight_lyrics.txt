FRASER/RODGERS

Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight.
See the smoke fills my room
Curl and whisper in the gloom
Then I long for the day
When the sun comes out to say
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight.
Now the clock says it's time for bed
Time for sleep the moon just said
Time for tears in your dreams
Will the tears all disappear come
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight

Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Broad daylight
Let me feel the morning
When the sun is downing
