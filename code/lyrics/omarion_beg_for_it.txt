Its Something I Wanna Do To You

Beg For It, don't Panic
When You See It, You Better Hold On
You Said You Need It, Well Damn It Come On
Ima Lay Right Here, While They Play My Song
Why don't You Beg For It, Take That Tongue
If You Going Naked, Better Get It Off
Don't Play With It Baby, Go 'head And Get It Off
Ima Beg For You Baby, As Soon As You Get On

You Gonna Let All Ur Girls Know, Aint No Second Guessing About Me

[Chorus:]
Beg For It, don't Panic
When You See It, You Better Hold On
