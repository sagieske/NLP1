Song:

Summer after high school waiting on the moment to change
I got a couple more weeks till I'm out of the house
And then were gonna go our separate ways
And all the Hometown Heroes stick around and all get a job
And the kids with good grades are making minimum wage
To pay tuition for a school at the top and all the college kids in the streets uptown
I walk the whole damn campus down
She asks what I want to do. I said, "I don't have a clue, 
But I'm already thinking 'bout getting out"
'Cause everybody's always talking 'bout how these are the best years they'll ever see
They just fall in line
Like they don't even mind somebody telling them who they're gonna be
Well I don't want anyone telling me where I'm gonna go or who I'm gonna see
Ain't gonna fall in line like I don't even mind somebody telling me who I'm gonna be
Czech Republic border French-kiss me on a Midnight Train
With the wine on the window Timeless Encounter Girl
It's time to kick nostalgia out of my brain
Cause I don't want anyone telling me where I'm gonna go or who I'm gonna see
Ain't gonna fall in line like I don't even mind somebody telling me who I'm gonna be
