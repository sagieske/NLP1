Song:

I've been here before and I don't like it
I'm trying to find where I went wrong
'Cause I never want to feel the way I do right now ever again
Totally lost and all alone

Can you save me?
Can you save me from myself?
Cause I've lost it all again
And I think maybe
You're the one who can pull me out
Of the holes I always dig

I said it before and always mean it
I promised this time will be the last
'Cause just when I thought that I've come so far from who I used to be
There's no escaping from my past

Can you save me?
Can you save me from myself?
Cause I've lost it all again
And I think maybe
You're the one who can pull me out
Of the holes I always dig

You're the one who can pull me out

One step forward
Two steps backward
One step forward
Two steps backward

Why, do I do this to myself?

Can you save me?
Can you save me from myself?
Cause I've lost it all again
And I think maybe
You're the one who can pull me out
Of the holes I always dig
