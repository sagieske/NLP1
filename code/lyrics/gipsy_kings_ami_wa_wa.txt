Song:

Amiwawa(Solo Por Ti) (Only For You)
Amiwawa, ai la mai ve...
Yo te quiero mas que a nadie
Tu solita no me mira
Pasa tu y no me habla
De penita ya moriria

Yo te quiero mas que a nadie
Tu solita no me mira
Pasa tu y no me habla
De penita ya moriria

Bailara, bailara, bailara
Solo por ti bailara, bailara
Solo por ti bailara, bailara
Solo por ti bailara

Yo te quiero mas que a nadie
Tu solita no me mira
Pasa tu y no me habla
De penita ya moriria

Amiwawa, ai la mai ve...

Amiwawa, ai la mai ve...
I love you more than anyone
You only don't look at me
You pass by and don't talk to me
From the pain I would die

I love you more than anyone
You only don't look at me
You pass by and don't talk to me
From the pain I would die

She will dance, she will dance, she will dance
Only for you she will dance, she will dance
Only for you she will dance, she will dance
Only for you she will dance

I love you more than anyone
You only don't look at me
You pass by and don't talk to me
From the pain I would die

Amiwawa, ai la mai ve...
