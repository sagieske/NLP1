Song:

Won't need no shadow man
Runnin' the government
Won't need no stinkin' war
Won't need no haircut
Won't need no shoe shine

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

What will people do?
After the garden is gone
What will people say?
After the garden

Won't need no strong man
Walkin' through the night
To live a weak man's day
Won't need no sunshine
Won't need no purple haze

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

Where will people go?

After the garden is gone
What will people know?

After the garden

After the garden is gone
After the garden is gone

(We live in the garden of Eden, yeah
Don't know why we wanna tear the whole thing to the ground
We live in the garden of Eden, yeah
Don't know why we wanna tear the whole thing down

And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden)
