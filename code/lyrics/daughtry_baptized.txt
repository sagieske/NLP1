Song:

It's safe to say I'm lost,
Without you in my arms,
So I call your name and I pray you might,
Come and watch over me like the pale moonlight,
Till the sun comes back around.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in till I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.
Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
I wanna be baptized.

And the days and nights are cold,
Without your body to hold,
So I close my eyes hoping you'll apear,
Cause it feels like grace everytime you're near, yeah,
Don't leave, till the sun comes back around.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in till I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.
Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water,
Pull me in till I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
Pull me in till I see the light,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey, honey,
In your love I wanna be baptized.

Take me down, take me down by the water, water,
In your love I wanna be baptized,
Let me drown, let me drown, in you honey,
I wanna be baptized.
