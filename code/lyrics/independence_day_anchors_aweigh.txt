Song:

Stand, Navy, out to sea, Fight our battle cry;
We'll never change our course, So vicious foe
Steer shy-y-y-y.
Roll out the tnt, Anchors Aweigh.
Sail on to victory
And sink their bones to Davy Jones, hooray!

Anchors Aweigh, my boys, Anchors Aweigh.
Farewell to college joys, we sail at break of day-ay-ay-ay.
Through our last night on shore, drink to the foam,
Until we meet once more,
Here's wishing you a happy voyage home.
