Song:

Yeah, said it's alright, I wont forget
All the times I've waited patiently for you
And you do just what you choose to do
And I will be alone again tonight, my dear

Yeah, I heard a funny thing somebody said to me
You know that I could be in love with almost anyone
I think that people are the greatest fun
And I will be alone again tonight my dear

(instrumental)
