Song:

My God and King
To You alone I sing
You're the face I seek
For all eternity
You'd be my dream come true
Just to be with You
How I'd see brand new
With eyes for only You
My God and King
Through the storm I sing
Covered by Your wing
This song of love I bring
You are my dream come true
Just to be with You
Now I see brand new
With eyes for only You
