Words and music by roger taylor

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

One dream one soul one prize one goal
One golden glance of what should be

It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm here in secret harmonies

It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
The rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be will soon be
Will soon be done
This is a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done-done
Magic - it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic magic
Ha ha ha it's magic
It's a kind of magic
