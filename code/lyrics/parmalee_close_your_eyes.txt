Song:

Well take a look at what's left in that sunset
Fireflies poppin' like the fourth of July, yea
You're gonna wanna see, every single thing
I'm gonna show you tonight
Got the perfect scene set of a moonlight glowin'
Just keep them baby blues wide open
Girl take a look around, yea it's goin' down
It's goin' down just right

Hey baby 'fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya, I want to show ya
What you don't wanna miss, nooo
It's all gettin' to what we've been waitin' on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Comin' on strong I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this

Sun goin' down nights are getting hotter
We got this bed backed up to the water
It's the place to be, if you wanna see
Every little shining star
But that view ain't nothin' like the you I'm lookin' at
Two tan legs for days dangling off the back
It all looks better baby you can see forever when
You're here in my arms

Hey baby 'fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya, I want to show ya
What you don't wanna miss, nooo
It's all gettin' to what we've been waitin' on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Comin' on strong I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this

You just really thought you'd really seen it all
Well it turns out, you don't have to see it all

Hey baby 'fore the night gets any older
Lean your pretty self over here a little closer
I need to hold ya, I want to show ya
What you don't wanna miss, nooo
It's all gettin' to what we've been waitin' on
I'm gonna go and turn you and the night on
Comin' on strong I'm gonna lay it on your lips
Might wanna close your eyes for this

Might wanna close your eyes for this
Hey pretty girl, might wanna close your eyes for this
Close your eyes for this
