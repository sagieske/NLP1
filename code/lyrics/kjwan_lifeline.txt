Song:

Hardly ever noticed
I'm lost in love again
But you could always see me, read me
Try to find an answer
Waiting for a sign
While you've been standing there

Close your eyes
Hold tight
Things are gonna be alright
Let it go
Let it flow
When you walk then you you will know
You'll always have His truth
It's right inside of you
Break out

Smashed against the pavement
Plastered on the walls
Hoping that you would find me, and save me again
Try to grab a lifeline
Waiting for your call
While you were always there

Close your eyes
Hold tight
Things are gonna be alright
Let it go
Let it flow
When you walk then you you will know
You'll always have His truth
It's right inside of you
Break out
