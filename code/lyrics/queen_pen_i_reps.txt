Song:

Big Dave, come in
Yo, go 'head
What's your twenty?
I'm in front of the a room right now

Ten four
I got cha
(She comin')
She's on her way to the back
I got cha
(She comin')

Don't let nobody fuck with her
(She comin')
I got cha
(She comin')
She got a lot to say, aight?
I got cha, I got cha
(She comin')

Step back bitch, better take notes
Teddy got too much dough for me to ever go broke
(Word)
I'm callin' your bluff, what you ever tote?
I'm raw and uncut like Columbian Coke

Now how many of y'all wanna fuck with me?
Trick question, who wants to fuck with Queen?
While y'all role play, I'm always mean
And before sound scan, I'm ate by the streets

You, you real funny to me
Like a drag queen with heels and a head full of weave
Talkin' about Ki's, that you never seen
(Seen)
Rappin' about gats, that you never packed
(Packed)

I'm da, original don dadda
And I say this to your face it'll take a whole lotta
For you, to catch up to my speed
Fuck your icey rings, fuck this industry

Take away the shine, you still a chicken wing
Bum bitch, yeah, I said it
(Yeah)
Bum bitch, and I never will regret it
(70,000 in the first week? That shit is ridiculous)

Don't bring them bitches around me
(I got cha)
Don't bring sand to the beach
(I got cha)
Pump QP in the jeeps
(I got cha)
We beez the baddest in the streets
(I got cha)

It's my time, to shine
(I got cha)
Those styles, y'all kicked, was mine
(I got cha)
Don't let me catch y'all tricks this time
(I got cha)
Take away your right to spit a rhyme
(I got cha)

I got a, chip on my shoulder and shit on my chest
I took a little break and bitches got overconfident
On the really girl, you don't want no conflict
Save your slick talk for Saturday night's at plex

QP is back, what did y'all expect?
That I stay pregnant forever, and live off of my publishing cheques?
All this bad chat got me kind of vexed
Y'all been talkin' about me ever since I fucked that nigga from next

It's all over, I'm shuttin' y'all down
By the end of the first quarter, y'all gone be sayin', "Damn she foul"
Dead, QP ain't playin' around
She goin' hardcore on y'all bitches dis round

Don't bring them bitches around me
(I got cha)
Don't bring sand to the beach
(I got cha)
Pump QP in the jeeps
(I got cha)
We beez the baddest in the streets
(I got cha)

It's my time, to shine
(I got cha)
Those styles, y'all kicked, was mine
(I got cha)
Don't let me catch y'all tricks this time
(I got cha)
Take away your right to spit a rhyme
(I got cha)

Big Dave, come in
Yo, go 'head
What's your twenty?
I'm in front of the a room right now

Ten four
(I got cha)
(She comin')
She's on her way to the back
I got cha
(She comin')

Don't let nobody fuck with her
(She comin')
I got cha
(She comin')
She got a lot to say, aight?
I got cha, I got cha
(She comin')
