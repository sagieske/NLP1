Song:

Thoughts of prison lying in my bed
Over visions dosing in my head
I've already lost much more
Than you could take from me

I've already been much more
Than you will ever be

I don't need it, You don't want to find me
I can see that, You don't even like me
You don't even, You don't wanna fight me
Man believe it, You ain't nothin' like me
I've already told you once
God damn stop pushin' me
I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go,
Come on let me be

I don't need it, You don't want to find me
I can see that, You don't even like me
You don't even, You don't wanna fight me
Man believe it, You ain't nothin' like me

And we pledge allegiance to a flag
Of a country that is f****d in the head

I don't need it, You don't want to find me
I can see that, You don't even like me
You don't even, You don't wanna fight me
Man believe it, You ain't nothin' like me

Like me
