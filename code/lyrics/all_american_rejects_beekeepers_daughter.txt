Song:

Laaadadadadaaa

I've been known a thousand ways
Choked a hundred hearts in half as many days
Oh no, I think so
And I get so lost inside this city
You ugly girls all look so pretty, it's true
What am I supposed to do?

I still got you away
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don't see me

You're a pretty little flower
I'm a busy little bee
Honey, that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
But then I'm gonna leave
Honey I know you'll wait for me

Laaadadadadaaa

You're all alone but you understand
That we're too young to start making plans of green
Monogamy's not a part of me
And I know my line and is just a sin
When I swear to you I'm gonna do it again
I'm not making any friends

I just wanted you to wait
There out your window
What do you see?
You don't see me

Cause you're a pretty little flower
But I'm a busy little bee
Honey, that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Baby then I'm gonna leave
Honey I know you'll wait for me

Laaadadadadaaa
Ladadadaadadadadaaa
Pulled out your picture the other day
(Isn't that sweet?)
You didn't have that much to say
('Cause it wasn't even me.)
Cause I know that you said
I'm better of on my own and I'm better off dead

I just want you there to wait
Look out your window
What do you see?
You don't see me

Come on, come on, come on
Dirty little flower
I'm a busy little bee
Honey that's all you need to see
I can take you for an hour
Maybe two or maybe three
Honey, I know you'll wait for me

Laaadadadadaaa
Ladadadaadadadadaaa

Honey, that's all you had to say
