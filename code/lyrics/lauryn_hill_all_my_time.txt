F/ Paid Alive

*Lauryn Singing*
You can't run away... Gonna find you
And take it slowly
You can't run away... Gonna find you
And make you want me

Chorus
All my time it could be spent with you
So what you gonna do?
Make sure your game is true
See all my time it could be spent with you
So what you gonna do?
Make sure your game is true

*Rapping*
Well could it be that through these Cartiers I swear
Their stares a specimen smooth as Sidney Poitier
Clean cut & dapper seems he's straight & narrow
Tingle in the bone marrow???
But I ain't that aggressive instead I act suggestive
Bat my eyelashes make smooth & subtle passes
Timed perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses
[he must have put a spell on my mind]*sung overlapping*
Amountin' all the words to do magic
With all due respect he approached it
And offered the roach clip as I respectfully declined to smoke it
[Nah nah I don't I don't do that] *spoken*
Broken the ice his demeanor was nice
He tried to freak it to my mental
[Ay yo it wasn't accidental]
Yo his talk was slick my resume is kinda thick
[So let's blow this scene girl and check this flick]
And show me why? Paid alive? Ain't ya average click
Recognize Paid Alive about to lock this s**t

Chorus

Yeah yeah I know you got a car
But we should keep it in the lot
I got a urge to ride the train
Let's do some walkin' in the rain
It sounds insane but meditative for the brain
Plus I'd like to get to see if you as crazy as you claim.

[Paid Alive]
?? Like Iceberg Slim in Donald Gowens
Uncut it's all raw dog hit me off
Paid Alive baby girl on sand this connection
Be hit through your burrow territorial section
True I come correct in all mine & denim
Truck trues top kid really wear linens
No question I'll show you affection
As I proceed to lead ya direction

[Lauryn] *rapping*
Well these procedures that you agreed to
I'm gonna need to know a little more
About ya self & family [License]
Well who's paid and who's live?
Where you live what you drive?
Ever did a homicide?
[I hope not] let our molecules collide
In time we'll tell if you can indoor with L
If you tryin to knock it down then I'm not that type of girl
My mind's a pearl and I done been around the world
But if you righteous I might just let you spend the night and...

Chorus

[Lauren] *sung parts*
*See all my tiiiime*... Ok that's right what?
Nah ain't nobody about wastin' my time
Like *ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah ye yeah*
Show me why Paid Alive ain't ya average click

*See all my time...*
