Song:

He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflications eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful you are
And how great your affections are for me

And oh, how he loves us so
Oh how he loves us
How he loves us so

He is jealous for me
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy

When all of a sudden
I am unaware of these afflications eclipsed by glory
And I realize just how beautiful you are
And how great you affections are for me

And oh, how he loves us so
Oh how he loves us
How he loves us so

Yeah he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves
Yeah he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves

We are his portion
And he is our prize
Drawn to redemption by the grace in his eyes
If grace is an ocean we're all sinkin' (haha)
So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest
I don't have time to maintain these regrets when I think about the way

He loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves
Yeah he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves Yeah yeah! 

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves Yeah yeah! 
Yeah he loves us
He loves us
He loves us

[Speaking]
His presence, his love is so thick and tangable in this room tonight
And there are some of you in here that have not encountered the love of God
And tonight God wants to encounter you and wants you to feel his love
His amazing love, without it these are just songs, these are just words, these are just instruments
Without the love of God, its, it's just like we're just up here just making noise
But the love of God changes us, and we're never the same
We're never the same after we encounter the love of God
We're never the same after we encounter the love of God
And right now if you haven't encountered the love of God
And you would know because you wouldn't be the same
You would never be the same again
And if you, if you want to encounter the love of God right now
You better just brace yourself, because he's about to just blow in this place
And we're gonna encounter the love of God right now
So God I speak to all the hearts and I ask God that every heart be open right now, every heart be open, every spirit be opened up to you God
To you and love encounter, a love ancounter from you tonight
A love encounter from you tonight God

Yeah he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves
He loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves us
Oh how he loves
His love is going deep
His love is going deep tonight
His love is going deep tonight
See the Father, behold the Father
Behold the Father
