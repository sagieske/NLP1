Song:

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better
This Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright,
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you
This Christmas
And as I look around,
Your eyes outshine the town they do
This Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

Emm, fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me, yeah

Merry Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Wish your brother merry christmas
All over the land
Yeah
Merry Christmas
Merry, merry Christmas
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Merry, merry, merry, merry
Emm, em
