Song:

Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know

I sit here by my window (All alone)
And listen to the breeze blow (Hmm...)
I wonder why it happens
Or do I really wanna know (Mmm... Mmm... Hmm... Mmm...)

It seems like just yesterday
I had everything in this whole wide world
[Where is that girl] Help me somebody
[Where is that girl] Help me somebody
[Where is that girl] Won't somebody tell me
Where is that girl, where is that girl, where is that girl

Do you really want answer (Ah, hoo, hoo)
Do you really want to know (Mmm)
Do you really want answer (Whoa, whoa, ho, yeah)
Do you really want to know (Yeah)
Do you really want answer (Uh-huh)
Do you really want to know

Is this really, really happenin' (A dream)
Am I alone tonight
I had such a lovely lady
Why couldn't I treat her right

She gave me everything I ever needed
With love warm and tender, yeah
What kind of fool was I (Whoa)
To ever let her go

Somebody tell me where can she be
[Where is that girl] Huh, help me somebody
[Where is that girl] Help me somebody
[Where is that girl] Won't somebody tell me
Where is that girl, where is that girl, where is that girl

Do you really want answer (No, no, no, no)
Do you really want to know (Ooh, ooh)
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know

Is there any room, uh-huh
For reconsideration
My whole world depends
On our reconciliation

Have I lost you, girl
[Do you really want to know]
Oh... Oh... Are you gone for good
[Do you really want to know]

Somebody told me
They saw you at the club
Sitting with a friend
[Somebody tell me, somebody tell me]
Have you found another love, baby
Have you found another love

Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer (Hoo... Ooh...)
Do you really want to know (Mmm, hmm)
Do you really want answer (Hoo... Ooh...)
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you

Ooh... Yeah
Ooh... Yeah
Ooh... Yeah
Ooh... Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
Do you really want answer
Do you really want to know
