Song:

You sigh, the song begins;
You speak, and I hear violins --
It's magic.
The stars desert the skies,
And rush to nestle in your eyes --
It's magic.
Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms,
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms.
When we walk hand-in-hand,
The world becomes a wonderland --
It's magic.
How else can I explain
Those raindrops when there is no rain?
It's magic.
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen are all really true?
When, in my heart, I know the magic is
My love for you.
It's magic...
It's magic...
Why do I tell myself
These things that happen are all really true?
When, in my heart I know, the magic is
My love for you.
