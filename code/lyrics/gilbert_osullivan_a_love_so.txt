Song:

I get a little bit of lovin' in the morning
I get a little bit of lovin' at night
I get a little bit of what I want
And when I know it's due
Get a little bit of kissin' and cuddling
Feeling that I wanna be liked
By you
With a love so......true

Never needed anybody who could need me
Never needed anybody to try
Never needed to be certain of that you can be sure
Never needed anybody to hold me
Now I have a feeling I might
Via you
With a love so......pure

Take this paper in my hand
If you sign it means we stand
Shoulder to shoulder in the days ahead
Even on occasion when the explanation
That I plan on making makes no sense

Didn't know what I could do till I could do it
Didn't know I couldn't do it till I tried
Didn't know it at the time and at the time I wasn't there
Didn't know about love and affection
Now it is a feeling I like
From you
A love so......rare

You could say that we're on cloud nine
But on a clear day it's a waste of time
You could be ringing a freedom bell
In a prison yard where the prison guard
Orders you to march back to your cell

I get a little bit of lovin' in the morning
I get a little bit of lovin' at night
I get a little bit of what I want if it's not too late
Get a little bit of kissin' and cuddling
Feeling that I wanna be right
By you
By you
By you
With a love so
A love so
A love so......great
