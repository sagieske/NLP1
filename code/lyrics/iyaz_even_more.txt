Song:

Oh, oh, oh! 
Even more, oh, oh! 
This morning while I laid in bed, 
I was playing in my mind all the things you said, 
You said happiness is just a dream and love is an impossible thing! 
Well no matter what you said is true, 
The possibility of loving is up to you, 
The wrong has been done to you, 
Girl, just let it go! 

[Bridge:]
When was the last time you felt real love?
The feeling that'll make you run and tell the world! 
A feel that warms you like the sun, 
So why don't you open your arms, girl?

[Chorus:]
My arms, your arms, oh! 
They're usually for hugging
So let's use them for what they're for! 
Your lips, my lips oh! 
They're usually for kissing
So let's use them for what they're for even more! 
Oh, oh! 
So let's use them for what they're for! 

So baby tell me how you're feeling now, 
Did you have a change of heart cause I saw you smile?
Don't let another break your self-esteem, 
Your heart is a beautiful thing! 
For true love I left all clues, 
Now what you gotta do is pick and choose, 
What's in front of you you'll never loose, 
So just let me know! 

[Bridge:]
When was the last time you felt real love?
The feeling that'll make you run and tell the world! 
A feel that warms you like the sun, 
So why don't you open your arms, girl?

[Chorus:]
My arms, your arms, oh! 
They're usually for hugging
So let's use them for what they're for! 
Your lips, my lips oh! 
They're usually for kissing
So let's use them for what they're for even more! 
Oh, oh! 
So let's use them for what they're for! 

Girl, let me show you love in the right way, 
All I need is your heart! 
Baby let me hold you! 
So I got all the time in my world, 
To hold and kiss... 
Hoping... 

[Chorus:]
My arms, your arms, oh! 
They're usually for hugging
So let's use them for what they're for! 
Your lips, my lips oh! 
They're usually for kissing
So let's use them for what they're for even more! 
Oh, oh! 
So let's use them for what they're for
