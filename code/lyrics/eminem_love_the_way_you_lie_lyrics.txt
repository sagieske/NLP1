[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie.

[Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is.
I can only tell you what it feels like.
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe.
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight.
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight.
High off her love, drunk from my hate, it's like I'm huffin' paint.
And I love it, the more I suffer, I suffocate.
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me, 
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it.
"Wait, where you goin'?"
"I'm leavin' you!"
"No you ain't! Come back!"
We're runnin' right back, here we go again! 
It's so insane, cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great.
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane.
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed.
I snap, "Who's that dude? I don't even know his name."
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again.
I guess I don't know my own strength.

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.

[Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe.
When you with 'em you meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em.
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get 'em.
Now you're getting fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em.
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em.
Now you're in each other's face, spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em.
You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw, 
Hit 'em, throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em.
It's the rage that's the culprit, controls you both.
So they say it's best to go your separate ways.
Guess that they don't know ya, 'cause today, that was yesterday.
Yesterday is over, it's a different day.
Sound like broken records playin' over, 
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance.
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again.
Now you get to watch her leave out the window.
Guess that's why they call it window pane.

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.

[Eminem]
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean.
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine.
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me.
When it comes to love you're just as blinded.
Baby please come back! It wasn't you, baby, it was me! 
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems.
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano.
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though.
Come inside, pick up the bags off the sidewalk! 
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball! 
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall! 
Next time? There won't be no next time! 
I apologize, even though I know it's lies! 
I'm tired of the games! I just want her back! I know I'm a liar! 
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, 
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire! 
Just gonna

[Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But that's all right, because I like the way it hurts.
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But that's all right, because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie.
I love the way you lie.
