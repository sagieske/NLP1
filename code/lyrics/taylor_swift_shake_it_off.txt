Song:

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, um-um, that's what people say, um-um
I go on too many dates, but I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, um-um, that's what people say, um-um

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, umm-umm, that's what they don't see, um-um
I'm dancing on my own, I'll make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know, um-um, that's what they don't know, um-um

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body and it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, Ishake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Refrain] (x4)
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been getting down 
And out about the liars and dirty, dirty cheats in the world you could have been getting down to this sick sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man bought his new girlfriend
She's like “oh my God”, but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, Ishake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Refrain] (x4)
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
