Song:

I was in - I led with grace, with head held high, a captivating charm, authority
I was pure - well I stood for truth when all was lost, if only for the slim minority
I was change - dissenting views, dissident sights, no room for fair, no mediocrity
I was good - you'd look to me to right the world outside and I'd deliver

Back in the day my words were strong and real
Back in the day my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day

I could see - my visionary views were sought, progressive outlooks on society
I could feel - my gut was solid, cold as stone, a consequence of loyal piety
I could change - adapt and compromise, evolve - laugh in the face of your anxieties
My memory's not what it used to be, but hon' it drives my ego

Back in the day my words were strong and real
Back in the day my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day

Too late, I've sealed my own fate.
Can sheer denial bring this beast back home?
Can I stay true, straight, but yield my whole faith?
Defy everything I've ever known?

Like a fad, I'll wake one day to find my limelight faded low - subdued sobriety
Like a craze, I'll watch my withered seams and ties grow indistinct, freed of variety
Like a man, the lines run deep, now drawn and frail, a life soon lost unto antiquity
Like a state, immortal words, forgotten wisdoms eulogized and clich–πing

Back in the day my words were strong and real
Back in the day my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day my words were strong and real
Back in the day my trails were blazed in steel
Back in the day
