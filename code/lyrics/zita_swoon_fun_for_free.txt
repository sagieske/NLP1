Song:

Maybe I misunderstood
A part of your story
But I believe you're no good
I'd say you're even quite boring
Altough I pay you no mind
I can't stand you much longer
Still it's giving me time
And it's making me stronger
Man your life is a lazy mess
You don't relate to the things that I like best
I know you're idle and cheating you're fake and deceiving
Though everything always seems cool
Man I just want you to know
That when you're making me worry
About the bond that we have
You simply can not ignore it
And when the going gets tough
I konw you're not gonna be here
So I won't ask you to go
'Cause you're constantly leaving
All your life
Is full of lies
I'm sorry friend
This can't go on
Maybe I misunderstood
A part of your story
I sometimes wish that I did
But then I know what I know man
Now if you wanna stay
You're gonna have to pay
Now try to make my day
Or leave me be
Yeah if you wanna stay
You better change your ways
I stop giving you
Your fun for free
So if you wanna stay
I wanna hear you say
You never really tried
To give some back to me
So if you wanna stay
You're gonna have to pay
I stop giving you
Your fun for free
