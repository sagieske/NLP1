Song:

After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time and I don't forget it
There'll come a time when you regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

After you've gone
After you've gone

After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time and I don't forget it
There'll come a time when you regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

After you've gone
After you've gone away, so far away
After you've gone
After you've gone away
