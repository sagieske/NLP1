Song:

A cannon was fired by the light of the moon
I'm waiting, the boat should be here very soon
And I mind less and less all the silly pictures that hang round my room, for now
I write you a letter
I hope you feel better
I hope you forgive the transgretions
I've given you love
And I've given you anger as well
And I meant them both
I always knew it was coming this way
Was coming this way
I always knew a big boat would come and take me away
Take me away
I stood on my bed
Then I slipped in my dress
Then I ran through the halls
Like a ghost
And in case someone heard me
I grabbed the big dagger that I'd never use
Unless
Barefeet on the cobblestones street
Then a peach
Then a splash
Then my ankles
My knees
Then my thighs
And my eyes open-wide
I threw myself right into the sea
And I could see it was coming my way
Was coming my way
I always knew a big boat would come and take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I've woken up once
And I've twice
And I've woken up millions and millions of times
Somebody's got to tell all the people to be like the water
Somebody's got to tell all the people to be like the water
I would if I could
But I can't so I don't
My heart breaks too easy
My words get all jumbled
And when I wear lipstick
Then no-one understands me at all
They think I'm saying hello and goodbye
Hello and goodbye
What I'm really saying is
(whispering)
They think I'm saying hello and goodbye
Hello and goodbye and hello
What I'm really saying is
(whispering)
I've woken up once
And I've woken twice
And I've woken up millions and millions of times
