Song:

She looked at me across the room
Emerging from a silk cocoon
Along beneath venetian chandeliers
Against the moon her body rocks
Her eyes were cunning like a fox
The wings of passion fly on all frontiers

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a lethal weapon
No one is to smart
In affairs of the heart

Now upon the bridge she waits
Dreaming of our tangled fates
Her face was like a ghost with eyes of jade
I fell just like a falling star
A victim of this coup d'etat
I could not see behind this masquerade

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a leathal weapon
Be careful where you start
In affairs of the heart

Sometimes I think I'll never learn
Were all those promises in vain
Do the wings of fire still remain

All is fair in love and war
The tender draw the shortest straw
Like autumn leaves they vanish in the air
Is this the time we say good-bye
I call her room there's no reply
Tonight we end this fleeting love affair

From this fire there's no returning
No escape your heart is burning
Love becomes a leathal weapon
Sharper than a dart
In affairs of the heart
