Song:

I am the man in the mirror.
My reflection I aspire to be.
In your reflection what do you see?
False fault or a masterpiece?
But a masterpiece starts with a single stroke
And empires start in an open field.
(I am the man in the mirror)

But a masterpiece starts with a single stroke. 
But a masterpiece starts with a single stroke. 
If we could all be steadfast suddenly, 
Then we'd never build a life worth living.
If we could all be steadfast suddenly, 
Then we'd never build a life worth living.
So let us restore each other, 
So let us restore each other.

I am the man in the mirror.
My reflection I aspire to be.
In your reflection what do you see?
False fault or a masterpiece?
I am the man in the mirror.
Man in the mirror, 
I am the man in the mirror
Man in the mirror.

I am the mirror. (x2)

So let us restore each other, 
Not with haste, but gently, 
For an empty cup cannot fill another.
An empty cup cannot fill another.
A blank canvas will later be priceless, 
And the love that we build will be endless.
Though we all stumble, we will not fall.

I am the man in the mirror.
My reflection I aspire to be.
In your reflection what do you see?
False fault or a masterpiece?
We will build masterpieces out of these faults, 
We will build.
We will build masterpieces out of these faults, 
We will build.
(I am the man in the mirror (x2))

So when I stare back into my own eyes
I try to peer past, and try to understand.
My imperfections compose my composure
And I can live with them and you will live by me.
So let us restore each other, not with haste, but gently, 
For an empty cup, an empty cup cannot fill another.
