Song:

Tracy
I can hear the bells

Penny
Tracy, are you all right?

Tracy
Well, don'tcha hear them chime?

Penny
I don't hear anything.

Tracy
Can't 'cha feel my heartbeat keeping perfect time?
And all because he...

Touched me
He looked at me and stared, yes he
Bumped me
My heart was unprepared when he
Tapped me
And knocked me off my feet
One little touch
Now my life's complete 'cause when he

Nudged me
Love put me in a fix, yes it
Hit me
Just like a ton of bricks, yes my
Heart burst
Now I know what life's about
One little touch
And love's knocked me out and,

Tracy (& ensemble)
I can hear the bells
My head is spinning
I can hear the bells
Something's beginning

Everybody says
That a girl who looks like me
Can't win his love
Well, just wait and see 'cause

I can hear the bells
Just hear them chiming
I can hear the bells
My temp'rature's climbing

I can't contain my joy
'Cause I fin'ly found the boy
I've been missin'
Listen!
I can hear the bells

Round one
He'll ask me on a date and then
Round two
I'll primp, but won't late because
Round three's
When we kiss inside his car
Won't go all the way
But i'll go pretty far!
And then,

Round four
He'll ask me for my hand and then
Round five
We'll book the wedding band so by
Round six
Amber, much to your surprise
This heavyweight champion
Takes the prize and...

I can hear the bells
My ears are ringing
I can hear the bells
The bridesmaids are singing

Everybody says
Thet a guy who's such a gem
Won't look my way
Well, the laugh's on them 'cause
I can hear the bells

My father will smile
I can hear the bells
As he walks me down the aisle

My mother starts to cry
But I can't see 'cause Link and I
Are french kissin'
Listen!
I can hear the bells

I can hear the bells
My head is reeling
I can hear the bells
I can't stop the pealing

Everybody warns
That he won't like what he'll see
But I know that he'll look
Inside of me yeah,

I can hear the bells
Today's just the start 'cause
I can hear the bells
And 'til death do us part

And even when we die
We'll look down from up above
Remembering the night
That we two fell in love

We both will share a tear
And he'll whisper as we're reminiscin'
Listen!
I can hear the bells

Ensemble

Tracy

Ensemble
She can hear the bells

Tracy
I can hear the bells

Ensemble
Bum, bum, bum, bum!
