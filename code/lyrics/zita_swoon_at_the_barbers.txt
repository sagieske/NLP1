Song:

Hello man and wife
I'm your supercharger
You mister,
You had a narrow squiek for it
But I got here some charm in a sqeeze bottle
Now you proof this groove
You make her proud,
You make her dance
No pruins and prims
I'm your supercharger
I'm your supercharger with rapt attention
Hey you Prowler
Hey you Jackanapes
Lives a little wish in me
Deep in my fantasy
Hide it in the light below
Waste it 'till it starts to glow
There's a flame that burns in me
Evil and through nightly skeems
Yonder lies my secret wish
Starts of with a little kiss
Oh God
Come again
You She-ass, You Jackanapes
