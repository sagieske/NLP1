Song:

Everyday life's in a hurry
It seems I can't hold on
And pressure in my world is heavy
I thought my strength was really gone
At the end of a hard working day
I have always wanted to look in your eyes each day
Though I know my life's in a real sotrm
This time I'm sure
I'm not alone

Chorus:
I can't deny that loving you is my strength
And it keeps me from falling
I can't deny that kissing you on your lips
Would now push me to move on
(Everyday I think that, I can't deny)

People have told me oh girl
That I won't make it through
Tryin' not to get so distracted
But sometimes it affects my moves

You have always said that love will find a way
I never made a point to see what you mean to say
Though I know my life's in a real storm
This time I'm sure
I'm not alone

Chorus:
I can't deny that loving you is my strength
And it keeps me from falling
I can't deny that kissing you on your lips
Would now push me to move on
(Everyday I think that, I can't deny)

At the end of a hardworking day
I have always wanted to look in your eyes each day
Though I know my life's in a real storm
This time I'm sure
I'm not alone

Chorus:
I can't deny that loving you is my strength
And it keeps me from falling
I can't deny that kissing you on your lips
Would now push me to move on
(Everyday I think that, I can't deny)

I can't deny...
(Repeat till fade)
