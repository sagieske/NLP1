Song:

Don't let you're love run dry oh oh x3

Illuminate the feeling
That you once lived on
This place is a wasteland
Lay your heart on the floor
Take it all out on me now
So I know that ya hear me
Throw all your fear to the wind
So you come back screaming

Chorus
Don't let your love run dry
I see you!
Don't let your love run dry
I see you!
Don't let your love run dry
I see you!... You!...

Drag those wolves through the dust
I can hear them howling
Scattered bones on the trail
Because they won't stop hunting
Let the water cleanse your soul
Relieve your heartache
Let moonlight enter you
And let it guide your way

Well I know what you think of who you are
And that's all that you need to be
If you go to the end
I will follow
If that's where you need me to be

Don't let your love run dry x3

Chorus 1x
