Song:

See the headlines
Have you heard the news
They're tryin' to turn the world upside down
We sit and watch it on tv
Programmed prophets trying to bring us down

Give us a break now
We know it can't all be bad news
Let's get away now
Cause when I'm holding on to you

We're all, we're all that really matters
The time is now
For taking our own chances
We're all, all that really matters

More brain power
Just to keep alive
Some computer trying to shut you down
The world powers watchin' the way you live
On a mission pushing us around

Give us a break now
No way we're gonna lose
We'll find a way now
Cause when I'm making love to you

We're all, we're all that really matters
The time is now
For taking our own chances
We're all, all that really matters

I wanna love you
I'm gonna try to make it right
Nothing can touch you
We'll make a dream come true tonight

We're all, we're all that really matters
The time is now
For taking our own chances
We're all, all that really matters

We're all, we're all that really matters
We're all, all that really matters
