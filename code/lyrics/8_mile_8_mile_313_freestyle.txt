Song:

[Rabbit]
Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
I roll like a renegade
You need clinicaid
My technique is bizarre n ill
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That's all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like your scared to lick p***y so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don't think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz's
I lead the new school
You a busta without the rhymes
I crush the s**t out your lines
