Song:

Well, I know the words,
But I can't really speak them,
To you.
And I hide all the pain,
That I've gained with my wisdom,
From you.
And I'm eaten alive,
By what I hold inside.
All the things that I live with,
I can't easily hide.
And I'm left here with nothing,
Nothing to live for;
But you.
It's not easy to hide,
All this damage inside.
And I'll carry it with me,
Until I'm not alive.
When you look at my face,
Does it seem just as ugly,
To you?
And I can't seem to erase,
All the scars I have lived with,
From you.
I'm so sick of this place,
And this taste in my mouth.
Cause of you I can't figure,
What I'm all about.
And I'm left here with nothing,
Nothing to live for but you.
It's not easy to hide,
All this damage inside.
I'll carry it with me,
'til I'm not alive
