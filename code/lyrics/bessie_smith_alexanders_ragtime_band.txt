Song:

Oh my honey
Oh my honey
You better hurry and let's go down there
Ain't you goin'?
Ain't you goin'?
To that leaderman, ragged meter man

Oh honey
Oh honey
Let me take you to Alexander's
Grand stand brass band
Ain't you coming along?

Come on and hear
Come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear
Come on and hear
It's the best band in the land

They can play the bugle call like you've never heard before
Sounds so natural that you'll wanna go to war
That's just the best band in the land
Oh honey lamb

Come on along
Come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man
Up to the man
Who is the leader of the band
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear
Come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band

Come on and hear
Come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear
Come on and hear
It's the best band in the land

Listen to the bugle call

Just the best band in the land
Oh honey lamb
Come on along
Come on along
Let me take you by the hand
Up to the man
Up to the man
Who is the leader of the band
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear
Come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
