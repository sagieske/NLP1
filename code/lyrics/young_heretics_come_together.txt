Song:

This life has seen better days
And this luck has seen better days

This house has seen better days
And this hope has seen better days

We need to come together
More than ever sweetheart
Light a torch and take your place at my side
Who knows if we will be comin' back
Who knows

We need to come together
More than ever sweetheart
Light a torch and take your place at my side
Who knows if we will be comin' back
Who knows
