Song:

Love me till the end of time
Till the seas run dry
Till the flowers forget to bloom
Till the sun don't shine

While there's people here on earth
While there's stars above
Oh I beg of you, my dear
Give me all your love

Give me all your love all of the time
As the wind that blows evermore, evermore
Till the moon has lost it's glow
In the heavens above
Oh I beg of you, my dear
Give me all your love

Give me all your love all of the time
As the wind that blows evermore, evermore
Give me all your love
