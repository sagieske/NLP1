Song:

All of my life, yes all of my life
I've waited, waited, waited for you
I dreamed and dreamed and thought and schemed
For someone, someone, someone like you

Now that you're here, please my dear
Don't ever, ever, ever go

All of my life, yes all of my life
I've dreamed and longed for you so

Once a voice whispered inside me
Wait for someone who's true
Don't love another for love is forever
And no one else will do

Now that you're here, I'm happy my dear
I've waited, waited, waited, waited for you
All of my life, yes all of my life
I've dreamed and dreamed of you

I've waited for you all of my life
