Song:

Mama raised me to be a man
Told me son you have to understand
Learn to get while the gettin's good
And bring it back to the neighborhood
And I swear, I was there
Tell me why should I lie
I just want to say
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
Uncle Henry and Cousin Grace
Used to weekend at our place
Grace and I would go behind the barn
We almost burned the damned thing down
And I swear, I was there
Tell me why should I lie
I just want to say
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
A little lovin' each and every day
A little lovin' goes a long, long way, long way
I knew a woman from New Orleans
Her old man used to treat her mean
And she would come to me for sympathy
Southern Comfort and ecstasy
And I swear, I was there
Tell me why should I lie
I just want to say
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
A little lovin' each and every day
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin'
A little lovin' each and every day
A little lovin' goes a long, long way
