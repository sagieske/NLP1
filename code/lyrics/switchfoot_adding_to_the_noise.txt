Song:

What's it gonna take
To slow us down
To let the silence spin us around?
What's it gonna take
To drop this town?
We've been spinning at the speed of sound.

Stepping out of those convenience stores
What could we want but more more more?
From the third world
To the corporate core
We are a symphony of modern humanity

If we're adding to the noise
Turn off this song
If we're adding to the noise
Turn off your stereo, radio, video

I don't know
What they're gonna think of next
Genetic engineers of the most high tech
A couple new ways
To fall into debt
I'm a nervous wreck but I'll bet
That that T. V. Set
Tells us what we've wanted to hear
But none of these sound bites
Are coming in clear
From the third world to the corporate ear
We are the symphony of modern humanity.
