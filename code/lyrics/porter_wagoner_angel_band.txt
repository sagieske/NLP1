Song:

My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph has began.

Oh, come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my imortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my imortal home.

--- Instrumental ---

Oh, bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanse us from all sins
And gives me victory.

Oh, come angel band
Come and around me stand
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my imortal home
Oh, bear me away on your snowy wings
To my imortal home...
