]:Sitting
on this soapbox he's got it all figured out Livin'
in doubt and proud of it with this gun in his mouth (Sitting
on this soapbox he's got it all figured out Living
in doubt and proud of it with this gun in his mouth) See
I'm all like optimism I'ma, give 'em a reason to hate me Stick
to pavement to pay rent pretend, to stay beef He
sprays heat 'cause he's a coward swears, his rep is steal Scared
to pray at night fightin', god to get a record deal See
I'm all like pessimism let, this wisdom hit 'em worse Disturbed
'cause he don't get it learned, his wisdoms just words Grew
up in the hood now, he's too good to rep his crew Read
the pictures laugh, at the words skip, lesson two Time
is money huh Time? heals our wounds as well Let?
the blind lead the blind to hell 'cause I'm trust in Qwel Time
is money huh Time? heals our wounds as well Let?
the blind lead the blind to hell 'cause I'ma trust in Qwel Sitting
on this soapbox he's got it all figured out Certainly
he's god and not enough churches Sitting????
on this soapbox he's got it all figured out Certainly
he's god and not enough churches [Verse????

2 ]:Pops
is gone like hope and dreams He
jokingly admits he drinks Controls
his b h***not his temper As
he leaks into the kitchen sink He
thinks before he's white and figures it's niggers and 'spics He
dates your brother and his bible not the liquor he sips See
I'm gone like apathy after he drinks his own convictions Holds
opinions over wisdom with close fisted a whipping** Ask
his children if they're f d****up If
their mothers feathers soft Calloused
to death by your mallet They're
probably better off Home
is where the heart is huh I'm?
hoping dad dies Love
can leave a woman blind mom But
so can black eyes Home
is where the heart is huh I'm?
hoping dad dies Love
can leave a woman blind mom But
so can black eyes Sitting
on this soapbox with nothing much to say Praying'
for night the speed of light died yesterday
