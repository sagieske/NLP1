Song:

Phantom-
Down once more to the dungeons
Of my black despair!
Down we plunge to the prison
Of my mind.
Down that path into darkness
Deep as hell!
(He rounds on her, bitterly)
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained
In this cold and dismal place?
Not for any mortal sin
But the wickedness of my abhorrent face!
(He hears the offstage voices of the pursuing mob)

Mob-
Track down this murderer!
He must be found!

Phantom (moving off again)-
Hounded out by everyone!
Met with hatred everywhere!
No kind words from anyone!
No compassion anywhere!
Christine, why? Why?

Madame Giry-
Your hand at the level of your eyes.

Raoul-
At the level of your eyes.

Mob-
At the level of your eyes.

Madame Giry-
He lives across the lake, Monsieur. This is as far as I dare go.

Raoul-
Thank you.

Mob-
Track down this murderer he must be found! Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera lives down below!

Christine-
Have you gorged yourself at last
In your lust for blood?
(no reply)
Am I now to be prey
To your lust for flesh?

Phantom-
That fate which condemns me
To wallow in blood
Has also denied me
The joys of the flesh.
This face, the infection
Which poisons our love.
This face which earned
A mother's fear and loathing.
A mask,
My first unfeeling
Scrap of clothing.
(he places veil on her head)
Pity comes too late,
Turn around and face your fate.
An eternity of this
Before your eyes!
(they are almost touching, she looks coldly into his face)

Christine-
This haunted face
Holds no horror for me now.
It's in your soul
That the true distortion lies.
(the phantom senses Raoul's presence, behind the portcullis Raoul comes out of water)

Phantom-
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest.
Sir.

Christine-
Raoul!

Phantom (to Raoul)-
This is indeed an unparalleled delight.
I had rather hoped that you would come.
And now my wish comes true.
You have truly made my night.

Raoul (pleading)-
Free her!
Do what you like only free her!
Have you no pity?

Phantom (to Christine, dryly)-
Your lover makes a passionate plea.

Christine
Please, Raoul, it's useless.

Raoul
I love her!
Does that mean nothing?
I love her.
Show some compassion.

Phantom (snarls furiosly at Raoul)
The world showed no compassion to me!

Raoul
Christine, Christine, let me see her.

Phantom
Be my guest, sir.
Monsieur, I bid you welcome.
Did you think that I would harm her?
Why would I make her pay
For the sins which are yours?
Order your fine horses now!
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes!
Nothing can save you now
Except perhaps Christine.
Start a new life with me.
Buy his freedom with your love.
Refuse me and you send your lover
To his death!
This is the choice!
This is the point of no return!

Christine
The tears I might have she'd
For your dark fate
Grow cold and turn to tears of Hate!

Raoul
Christine, forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
I did it all for you and all for nothing.

Christine
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend.
We had such hopes.

Phantom
Too late for turning back.

Christine
Now those hopes are shattered.

Phantom
Too late for prayers and pity.

Raoul
Say you love him

Phantom
All hope of cries for help.

Raoul
And my life is over

Phantom
No point in fighting.
For either way you choose you cannot win.

Raoul
But either way you choose he has to win.

Phantom
So do you end your days with me?
Or do you send him to his grave?

Raoul
Why make her lie to you to save me?

Christine
Angel of music.

Phantom
Past the point of no return.

Raoul
Christine, say no!

Christine
Who deserves this?

Raoul
Don't throw your life away for my sake.

Phantom
His life is now the prize

Christine
Why do you trust me?

Phantom
Which you must earn,

Raoul
I fought so hard to free you!

Phantom
You've past the point of no return!

Christine
Angel of music
You deceived me.
I gave you my mind blindly.

Phantom
You try my patience.
Make your choice.

Christine
Pitiful creature of darkness
What kind of life have you known?
God give me courage to show you,
You are not alone.

Mob
Track down this murderer.

Phantom
Take her! Forget me.
Forget all of this.
Leave me alone.
Forget all you've seen.
Go now!
Don't let them find you.
Take the boat. Leave me hear, go now don't wait just take her and go before it's too late... Go... Go now and leave me!

Mob
The phantom of the opera is there
Deep down below.

Phantom
(musical box plays magicaly)
Masquerade!
Paper faces on parade.
Masquerade!
Hide your face
So the world will never find you.
Christine, I love you

Christine
Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime.

Raoul
Say the word and I will follow you

Christine
Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Phantom
You alone can make my song
Take flight.
It's over now, the music
Of the night!!! (Phantom sits on throne sits on part of his cloak, wraps the rest around him and disappears, Meg picks up his mask in her little hand)
