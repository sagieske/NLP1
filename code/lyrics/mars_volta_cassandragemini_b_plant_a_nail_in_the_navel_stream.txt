Song:

brick by brick the night eclipsed
pricked by cuticle thorns
dried the sleep on nursery slits
into this life i'm born
heaven's just a scab away
i'd like to see you after just one taste
sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
night forever more
let them see it has begun
the others i've become
if you should see the dice
charmed with it's snaked choked eyes
you'll wear the widow's weeds
because they're just your size

behind the snail secretion
leaves a dry heave that absorbs
a limbless procreation
let the infant crawl deformed
a bag replaced the breath of these suffocating sheets
and now when the craving calls i'll scratch my itchy teeth

come on and sing it now

sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
night forever more

she fell for the whispers
sister flooded deaf tears
that night tore a river
in her baron womb mirror
and his multiple sons with their mandible tongues
set crucified fires to petrified homes
let it burn

and the owls were watching
and the owls didn't care
then the owls came a knocking
placentas in their stares
they will feed on all the carnage
left over from the flood
and in the corner of their eyes
fled sister l'via

now the pieces went floating
reflecting all at dusk
concieved from the stabbing
was vismund cygnus

twenty five wives in the lake tonight
raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
twenty five snakes pour out your eyes
yeah the ice picks cumming on the marble shrine
twenty five wives in the lake tonight
raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
twenty five snakes pour out your eyes
twenty five snakes are drowning
