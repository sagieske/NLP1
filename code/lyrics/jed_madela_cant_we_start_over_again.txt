Song:

It's been a long long while
I know I've caused you pain
Living without you it's not quite the same
Can we start over again
I played around to long
Running from end to end
Took you for granted
I've been such a fool
Can't we start over again

All through my life for season
No matter how far I roam
Always theres something
Missing inside yearning to come back home
You are the one I return to
Love only love leads the way
Give us this chance start over again
Darling I'm coming home to stay
