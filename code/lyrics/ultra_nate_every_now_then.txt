Song:

A memory of you in my head
Id rather love you instead
After all the pain youve put me through
Sometimes at night I still need you

Pre chorus
You took me through changes
But no one loves me like you do
Love leaves me so empty
And when you're gone
I fall apart

Chorus
Every now and then
Every now and then
I want to call you
Every now and then
Every now and then
I want to call you

Promised myself
A thousand times
Id learn to live
Without your smile
Other loves try to take
Your place
But your sweet touch
I can't erase

Pre chorus
