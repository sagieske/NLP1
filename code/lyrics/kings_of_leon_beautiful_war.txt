Song:

Bite your tongue
Don’t let us end here
Everybody’s been here
At least once before
We’ve been here more

Your heart breaks
Rolls down the window
I’ve seen it all go and comeback around
And I’ve heard the sound

Tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs
Is doing my head in
I say love I don’t need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
It’s a beautiful war

When I hold the warmth of your body
There is nobody that I’d rather hold
Shattered and cold

Tip of your tongue
The top of your lungs is making me crazy
I say love I don’t need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
It’s a beautiful war

I say love you don’t need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for
It’s a beautiful war
It’s a beautiful war
It’s a beautiful war

I say love I say love
Don’t need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for

I say love
Don’t need nothing
Left them something worth fighting for

It’s a beautiful war
It’s a beautiful war
It’s a beautiful war
It’s a beautiful war
