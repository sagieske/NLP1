Song:

(Brock)
Squatting in your bodies, microscopic breeding.
I sleep in you and eat from within.
I am the Alien. We are here to help you.
Make the mend in the chemical bend.
We are the Aliens.
I lack emotion, have no love that I can find.
I want some devotion, to ease a worried mind.
The heart is softened, soul is scorched.
The mind erodes away some sentimental thought.
The window crackes is closed.
The door slams shut, the lights put out.
Say no more, speak no less.
For you I become the Alien I am.
For you I become the Alien I am.
The cry primal is muffled, the mouth seal's tight.
The eye looks within, say no more, speak no less.
I the Alien.
I am the Alien
Reject your human touch.
I lack emotion, have no love that I can find.
I want some devotion, to ease a worried mind.
The heart is softened, soul is scorched.
The mind erodes away some sentimental thought.
This is Alien control, calling space ship Earth.
Alien control calling Earth, are you receiving Earth?
Are you receiving...
We are the Aliens.
We have warned you about...
The danger
We are... We are... We are... We are...
