Song:

It was early one morning, when all the good work was done
It was early one morning, when all the good work was done
And that big bird was loaded, with that awful atomic bomb

Wrote my baby, I was behind the risin' sun
Wrote my baby, I was behind the risin' sun
I told her, don't be uneasy, because I'm behind the
Atomic bomb

Nation after nation, was near and far away
Nation after nation, was near and far away
Well, they soon got the news, and there where they would
Stay

Over in east Japan, you know, they let down and cried
Over in east Japan, you know, they let down and cried
And poor Tojo, had to find a place to hide
