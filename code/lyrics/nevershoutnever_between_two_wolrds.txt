Song:

I feel fine, 
I feel alright, 
I feel so good just like I knew I would
Here I stand stuck between two worlds
My closest friends
Know me as the man I am
Still, 
I'm stuck between two worlds 
I close my eyes
And there it is
I can't deny
I'm stuck between two worlds

You're in a dream
Within a dream 
Identity 
Constructed
Reality 
Please wake up 
And smell the coffee I made just for you 

I feel fine 
I feel alright
I feel good just like I knew I would 
Here I stand stuck between two worlds
My dirty past, 
Has finally come to pass.
Still I am stuck between two worlds
Open your heart
And let it in.
You can't deny, 
You're living in one world.

You're in a dream, 
Within a dream
Identity 
Constructed
Reality
So please wake up
You're living in a haze 
It's insane
How much pain.
You must be you, to please wake up 
You're insane 
It's all in vain to 
Cut yourself off
From love 
Ooohhh
Sweet love.

Please wake up 
And smell the coffee I made just for you.
