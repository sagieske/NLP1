Song:

A light on your shoulder,
Cool as ice and bright as lightnin'
Thunder in your eyes,
Talk to me and tell me
I'm in deeper every move.
'Till I'm almost lost in you.
Can you feel the way
That I can't hold back,
There's no limit to
What love can do.

Girl, it's only
You and me against the night.
In the shadows,
Finding love could save your life.
In a world of strangers,
The lovers will survive.
It's all that we have,
You and me against the night.

We should be movin',
Like a thief time steals your chances.
Now we got the fire,
But you wonder how long can we
Keep the spark alive.
If it takes us through the night.
Then it's all that I need
And I won't take less,
For the moment I know you're mine.

Girl, it's only
You and me against the night.
In the shadows,
Finding love can save your life.
In a world of strangers,
The lovers will survive.
It's all that we have,
You and me against the night.

Lead Break

Can we keep the spark alive?
'Cause it takes us
Through the night.
Then it's all that I need, And I won't take less,
For the moment I know you're mine,
You're mine, yeah.
Girl, it's only
You and me against the night.
In the shadows,
Finding love can save your life.
In a world of strangers,
The lovers will survive.
It's all that we have,
You and me against the night.
You and me against the night.
Against the night
