]:Some
knew my uncle Roc as a mob figure But
to me he was much bigger he was like a father figure All
that crooked s t**he did he never let us see Welcome
me into his home givin' me family A
man to me closer than my own pops My
cousins ain't my cousins they're, my brothas and that lovin' wont stop Never
wanted the come I would never throw ya name For
personal gain too, much respect in my veins Grow
to me like your own and I never got to thank ya Angry
when I saw what they printed in the paper Offered
to take me in when I lost my mom That's
why I respect you more than any mafia don I
didn't know that man that did the federal bids I
knew a man who give the whole world to his kids Knew
a man who was funny and he had a good heart And
I'ma treasure you forever I'm a miss you uncle Roc [Chorus

]:In
my life I never had a dad But
you we're right there to guide me down the path Given
me the things I woulda never had Even
though it's hard now that 'cha passed I
still move on try, not to be sad I
had you in my life I think god for that And
I just hope that I can be Half
the man you have to be [Verse

2 ]:Grandpa
you did a better job wit me than your son No
disrespect to my father but you got the job done Taught
me how to win respect that I'll never forget Working
hard all your life poured blood tears, and, sweat Taught
me honor and pride and, I feel hollow inside Wit
out 'chu in my life I'm so sorry you died Took
me from a boy to a man and, you raised me Not
just for me you, did the same thing for Jamie But
you were the glue that held the family together Never
thought after you passed that the family would sever All
of our ties and, just stop communicatin' But
without ya love I guess we started hatin' But
we was all there around the hospital bed We
were prayin' and cryin' I said goodbye then I kissed ya forehead Watchin'
my hero trying to breathe on a respirator Yesterday
the pain was even greater watchin' as you fade away Right
before my eyes wishin', I could save you Right
until the end you were so strong and brave too Named
my son after you and you were so proud Told
everyone you knew about 'cha great grandchild You
held him in ya arms broke a tear couldn't speak If
only I knew you, woulda passed the next week I
woulda told you were my world thank you for your love I
hope your lookin' down watchin' over us from above Because
you, were the one who played the role model Without
'chu in my life my hearts filled with sorrow I
guess what they say no one is promised tomorrow Its
true Gods, mysterious ways would always follow You
taught me life lessons I'ma carry for life Pass
it on to my seed and, try to bring him up right Without
these influences I don't know where I'd be In
the cemetery or in the penitentiary [Chorus
