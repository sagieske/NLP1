Song:

I want to live forever
Inside the nights and days.
Wishing on a silver cloud,
Crawling across the moonbeams.
A summer night in heaven
Between the stars and waves.
Race across the old bonfire;
Trample on my heartbeat.

I wanted to turn you on
My favorite song.
Wanted to be near you
But somebody owns you now.

I love you with a fire,
Ablazing till times end
But what good is a heart
When it shudders to speak.
I guess it's too late now.

'i wanted to turn you on
My favorite song.
Wanted to be near you
But (of course) somebody owns you
Now.
(and) I tried to live somehow
Somebody owns you now' (repeat 2x)

Somebody owns you now
