Song:

I'm not too big a fan of beer but I need a drink
If I smoked I could use a zip now I'm on the brink
I've been all geared up now for how long I don't know
I need to slow myself down somewhat it's been so long
So all I do is staring at my ceiling where the rain keeps coming in
I seem unable to relax don't know how to begin
Should I just lay down and close my eyes and pretend that I am dead
I need some help to float away would you please hit my damn head
I need some help to float away would you please hit my damn head
Hit my head
I never took no drugs I guess I'm just not the type
That maharishi-guy was never quite mine I was chose to bye the hype
Cosmic yoghurt and Jesus Christ was never my cup of tea
Sure thing girls are much great fun but at times they are probably best let be
So still I keep on staring...
I need some help to float away...
Hit my head
I need some help to float away...
Hit my head ::
