Song:

Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome and o how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you recall when we parted
The story to me you revealed
You said you could live without loving
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years love
To give you a heart true and real
Cause I know you're living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shine bright from yer window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
