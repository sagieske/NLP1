Song:

Chorus:
Oh, have you been to Avondale
And lingered in her lovely vale?
Where tall trees whisper low the tale
Of Avondale's proud eagle.

Where pride and ancient glory fade,
Such was the land where he was laid,
Like Christ was thirty pieces paid,
For Avondale's proud eagle.

Long years that green and lovely glade,
Have lost for now our grandest Gael,
And Cursed the land that has betrayed,
Our Avondale's proud eagle
