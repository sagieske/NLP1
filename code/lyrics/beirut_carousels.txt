Song:

Carousels twirl all around exited youth.
I do not mind at all.
We're tonight in a world full of thrills - it can (come) carry me up,
Far above it all.

It's a long way down from here to the sound.
Watch the faces go 'round
To the stars
Then the ground.

Ferris wheels carried us away
Not so long ago.
Times I've betrayed.
Where would we be now if I had taken your hand?
Well the years they pass by slow
Don't they?

It's a long way down from here to the sound.
Watch the faces go 'round
To the stars
Then the ground
