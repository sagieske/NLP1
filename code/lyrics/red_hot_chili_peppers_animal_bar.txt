Song:

Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta a feeling of worth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)

All aboard the ship
'Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and
I'm a little older
Right as rain
At the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for my precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation

And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta a feeling of worth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)

Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat

Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find it's day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away

Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 lets break this)
In between the sky and every piece of earth
(1, 2, 3 forsake this)
