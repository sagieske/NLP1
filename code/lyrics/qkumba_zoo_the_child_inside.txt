Song:

Who's that calling?
Who's that who can show the way?
The child inside, its the child who lives still in your eyes
Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, ne ho ne yehe ha
Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, neho neho nehe hehe

Who's that dying,
Trying for a space in the cage you call your life
Who's that crying
Crying out just what it is you've thrown away

It's the. ..

The child inside, its the child who lives still in your eyes

Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, ne ho ne yehe ha
Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, neho neho nehe hehe

Who's that dancing
Laughing crying living every day by day by day by day

It's the. ..

The child inside, its the child who lives still in your eyes

Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, ne ho ne yehe ha
Ne ho ne ye he hiyo, neho neho nehe hehe

Secret of the sun is in your eyes
Take the power from your dreams and fly
Children know it's magick that makes the world go round
