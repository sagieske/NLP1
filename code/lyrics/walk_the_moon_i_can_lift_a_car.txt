Song:

When I come home, when I come home
Oh I hear you washing in the shower
Mirages of you, mirages of you
Even steam pouring through the crack at the floor

I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it
Holding steady, holding steady, holding steady, holding steady

All by myself (I can lift a car)
All by myself (I can lift a car)
I can lift a car up all by myself

All by myself (all by myself)
All by myself (all by myself)
I can lift a car up all by myself

So very nice, so very nice
My grandpa's leather jacket and goggles
So you kissed me on the futon
Oh I hope you like it in Chicago

Holding steady, holding steady, holding steady, holding steady
I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it

All by myself (I can lift a car up)
All by myself (I can lift a car up)
I can lift a car up all by myself

All by myself (all by myself)
All by myself (all by myself)
I can lift a car up all by myself

Didya, didya, did you know that
I can lift a car up all by myself
Well no misunderstanding I'm not saying that you can't
But did you know that I can lift a car up all by myself?

I've been going out and trying to stay fit
Well I met someone who wears your glasses
She kissed me on my new futon
And I'm clumsy cause she finds me attractive

I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it, I won't lose it

All by myself (I can lift a car up)
All by myself (I can lift a car up)
I can lift a car up all by myself

All by myself (all by myself)
All by myself (all by myself)
I can lift a car up all by myself

Didya, didya, did you know that
I can lift a car up all by myself
Well no misunderstanding I'm not saying that you can't
But did you know that I can lift a car up all by myself?
(All by myself)

Hey! Hey!
Didya didya?
I can lift a car up all by myself
