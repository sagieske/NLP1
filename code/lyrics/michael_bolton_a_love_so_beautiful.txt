Song:

The summer sun went down on our love long ago
But in my heart I feel the same old afterglow
A love so beautiful in every way
A love so beautiful we let it slip away

We were all too young to understand to ever know
That lovers drift apart and that's the way love goes
A love so beautiful a love so free
A love so beautiful a love for you and me

And when I think of you I fall in love again
A love so beautiful in every way
A love so beautiful we let it slip away

And when I think of you I fall in love again
A love so beautiful we let it slip away
A love so beautiful in every way
A love so beautiful we let it slip away
