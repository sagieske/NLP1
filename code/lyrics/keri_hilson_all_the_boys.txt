Song:

Oooh yea, Oh
You love me, love me, love me, Ohh 
So long my love-sick youngsters
Goodbye my used to be friends
I remember each vacation, each day we wasted
It felt so different then
So long my cassanovas, farewell to my long lost prince
I remember all the kisses, the hits and misses
I never knew a love like this

After all the boys I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
After all the boys that I wish had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this before
Say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me, loved me, loved me
Oh yeh you love me, love me, love me, 
Ooh you love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door

So long my towering soldiers, reminscin bout the boy cross town
Peace to the wide-eyed genius, with hollywood dreams
Said he'd never wanted to be tied down
So long my high-school teacher, 
Yeah I had a crush but I couldn't reach ya
Remember all the guys, they were never right
I'm so glad I found you this time
After all the boys I thought I loved before
I didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
After all the boys that I wish had loved me more
I didn't know what love was
Never had this before
Say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me, loved me, loved me
Oh yeh you love me, love me, love me, 
Ooh you love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
Oh I didn't know, no I did not know, til you let me know
And I did not see, I could ever be, this happy
And I never loved in the way that I do today
Oh I'll never be the same, since your loving came my way

Say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me, loved me, loved me
Oh yeh you love me, love me, love me, 
Ooh you love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
Say you love me, love me, love me
You love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Until you loved me, loved me, loved me
Oh yeh you love me, love me, love me, 
Ooh you love me, love me, love me
Didn't know what love was
Til you knocked on my door
