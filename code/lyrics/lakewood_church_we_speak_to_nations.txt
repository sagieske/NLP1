Song:

We speak to nations
Hear the sound
The sound of the nations worshiping
Hear the sound

Of sons and daughters singing
Who will go for us?
Who will shout to the corners of the earth?
That Christ is King

We speak to nations, be open
We speak to nations, fall on your knees
We speak to nations
The Kingdom is coming near to you

We speak to strongholds, be broken
Powers of darkness, you have to flee
We speak to nations
The Kingdom is coming near to you

We speak to you, be free
(Yeah yeah)
Be free

Hear the sound, hear the sound
The sound of the nations calling
Hear the sound, hear the sound

The sound of the fatherless, crying
We will go for you
We will shout to the corners of the earth
That Christ is King

Be free
(Yeah yeah)
Be free
(Yeah yeah)
Be free
(Yeah yeah)
Be free

(Out of every nation, tribe and tongue)
(Lord, we want to see Your Kingdom come)
(Out of every nation, tribe and tongue)
(Lord, we want to see Your Kingdom come)
From the north, the south, the east and west
Be free, be free, be free

We speak to nations, be open
We speak to nations, fall on your knees
We speak to nations
The Kingdom is coming near to you
We speak to you, be free
