Song:

Lookin' for a brighter tomorrow
Hopin' that the wind and rain is clear
Layin' down by the river
Wearin' out my old blue jeans

So many things have come between us
Gotta stand up and move around
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh, with you

I still love to go to the river
Ahhh, just to wash my blues away
And the wind is still blowin'
But without you, oh the rain don't feel the same
I can see by the tears in your eyes
I don't wanna live on a memory
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh, be with you, with you, yeah

All alone at night with everything you need
Reflections in the mirror is all you really see
You're just someone else and I can't live on a memory
I just wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
Say you wanna fall in love again
I don't want our dreams to ever end
I just wanna fall in love again
Ahhh, baby, with you, with you
I wanna fall in love again
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh
