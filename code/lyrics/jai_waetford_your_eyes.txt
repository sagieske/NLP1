Song:

It started out with a picture
Now it's war with the mirror
I can't win your fight
I hope you know that you never
Have to be on the cover
Girl, you're already mine

No matter what I do
It's like you never see you
The way that I want you to
You're the one that I've been dreaming of
All this time

What's it gonna take to show you
I'd give the world up just to hold you
When the stars fill up the sky
They got nothing on your eyes
What's it gonna take to show you
I'd give the world up just to hold you
When it all becomes too much
I hope this song will be enough

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, oh
When the stars fill up the sky
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, oh
They got nothing on your eyes

Go and take down the posters
Say goodbye, nice to know you
Then you'll realize
That girl your beauty is blinding
So there's no point denying
You don't have to try, oh

No matter what I do
It's like you never see you
The way that I want you to
You're the one that I've been dreaming of
All this time

What's it gonna take to show you
I'd give the world up just to hold you
When the stars fill up the sky
They got nothing on your eyes
What's it gonna take to show you
I'd give the world up just to hold you
When it all becomes too much
I hope this song will be enough

Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, oh
When the stars fill up the sky
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, oh
They got nothing on your eyes
