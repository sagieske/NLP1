Song:

I'd rather stay inside than being out tonight
Just sipping coffee and nothing to look forward to
Savoring my solitude
And no one will ever know you the way I do

In high definition I'm dreaming of you
With my disposition I'm losing my cool
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you

And I will try my best to let it subside
I'm letting go without taking any part of
Something what my heart truly wants
And no one will ever see you the way I do

In high definition I'm dreaming of you
With my disposition I'm losing my cool
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you

[Instrumental]

In high definition I'm dreaming of you
With my disposition I'm losing my cool
With my everything I'd give anything to be with you
