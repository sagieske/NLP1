Song:

Together we killed the colony
We'll take away the heart in me
A looser grip, failed to notice
Puling away when you reach for it

I've been moving slowly since then
Take the call to break the pattern
We could find a reason to leave
But you will always have part of me

I held your hand and felt your skin
But I could not get used to it
Together we killed the colony
We'll take away the heart in me

Because I've been moving slowly since then
Take the call to break the pattern
We could find a reason to leave
But you will always have part of me

I've been moving slowly since then
Take the call to break the pattern
We could find a reason to leave
But you will always have part of me
