Song:

This could be my last confession
This could be my last defense
I wish that we could learn our lesson
I wish that we could make amends
And turn the page

Chorus:
As far as I can remember
It was a day to forget and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didn't mean what you said
Now it's time to surrender, 
Cause I don't wanna live with regret
And nothing lasts forever, as far as I remember

This could be a new beginning
Or this could be a brutal end
I wish that we could stop pretending
I wish that we could make amends
And turn the path

Chorus:
As far as I can remember
It was a day to forget and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didn't mean what you said

Now was time to surrender, 
Cause I don't wanna live with regret
And nothing lasts forever, as far as I remember

I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees

Chorus:
As far as I can remember
It was a day to forget and forget
You said that you would let go
But I guess you didn't mean what you said
Now it's time to surrender, 
Cause I don't wanna live with regret
And nothing lasts forever, as far as I remember

I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
I'd rather die on my feet than live my life on my knees
