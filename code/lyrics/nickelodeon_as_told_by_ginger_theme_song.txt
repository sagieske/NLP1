Song:

Someone once told me
The grass is much greener
On the other side
And I paid a visit
(Well, it's possible I missed it)
It seemed different,
Yet exactly the same
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Til further notice,
I'm in-between
From where I'm standing,
My grass is green
Someone once told me
The grass is much greener
On the other side.
