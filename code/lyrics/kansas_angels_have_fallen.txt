Song:

(Steve Walsh)

Angels have fallen, fallen from heaven, where did they go
No one could save them no one forgave them their chance to know
When I hear them below I think how it is to be weary
Children are restless they know what can happen when men are vain
Talking in riddles won't keep them from knowing you've gone insane
They know a few will try to gain by trying to live like their teachers

[Chorus:]
Save me for now, save me forever
Hold me so close, I can't bear to go
There's darkness around me or is it within me
You're living forever, I'm dying so slow

Inside a window that leads to your conscience you'll see, you'll hear
People are talking maybe you know them, they know you're near
Masking themselves from fear and asking themselves who their friends are

[Chorus:]

Well you say that you've been here in this life and time
You say it's no good here, but you say that so fine
You reach for your winnings, an angelic excuse
Round them you act humble, still you never refuse
You better tell all your people to watch for a sign
Make them glad they are living in this life and time
The angels have fallen, they've all gone away
It's you that must find them by living each day
