Song:

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Dispenser man, if you please
Serve my chick a mess of calories

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Slip back the lid, scoop everything in sight
Make it a rainbow of red, brown and white
Chocolate chip and everything that's nice
Tutti-frutti once and spumoni twice

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Spray the whipped cream for at least an hour
Pile it as high as the Eiffel Tower
Load it with nuts, about sixteen tons
Top it with a pizza just for fun

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Stack her up with crazy goo
'Cause that's the stuff she likes to wade right through

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Now add the cherries the kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana, use the whole darn bunch
Drown it in fudge, six or seven cans
Give her two spoons, she'll eat it with both hands

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Separate checks, it must be
Charge the split to her, the water to me

Oh the banana split's for my baby
And the glass of plain water's for me
Ain't got no money
The glass of plain water's for me
