Song:

When I wake up in the morning
Love
And the sun light hurts my eyes

And something without worning
Love
Bears heavy on my mind.
Then I look at you and the world's alright with me

Just one look at you and I know it's gonna be -

A lovely day - lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day

Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day.
A lovely day - lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day

Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day.

When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face

And someone else instead of me always seems to know the way
Then I look at you and the world's alright with me

Just one look at you and I know it's gonna be -

A lovely day - lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
...
When the day that lies ahead of me seems impossible to face
...
A lovely day - lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
...
