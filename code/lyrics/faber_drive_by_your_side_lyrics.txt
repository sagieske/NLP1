Song:

I'll turn off the lights
And let you sleep
Just close your eyes,
Relax and breathe

In slowly, no don't feel lonely 'cause
I'll be right here by your side,
If you should awake into the night

Keep dreamin' 'cause
I'll be keepin' your heart in mine.
(Don't you know I'll always be here)
Even in my hardest times
(Don't you know my spirit's right here)

When you're feelin' sad
Just remember that it's alright
When you close your eyes I'm by your side

Remember the days when we would drive
Into the night we watched them
Skies of summer so full of colour and
Remember the days when waves would roar
Up on the beach to touch our toes
On soft sand my hand in yours
And your heart in mine,
Don't you know that I'll always be here

Even in my hardest time
(Don't you know my spirit's right here)

When you're feelin' sad
Just remember that it's alright
When you close your eyes

And when you feel like you
Can't keep on going on now
Don't be scared I'm right there
I'll be there right beside you
I'll be the light that lights your way

Turn off the lights and let you sleep
Just close your eyes relax and dream
And keep your heart in mine.
(Don't you know I'll always be here)
Even in my hardest times
(Don't you know my spirit's right here)

When you're feelin' sad
Just remember that it's alright
When you close your eyes I'm by your side
