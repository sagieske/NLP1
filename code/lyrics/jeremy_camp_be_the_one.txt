Song:

And all these dreams I've made
I take them all and lay them down
In light of reasons I have found now
And I can rest in knowing you will open every door
Instead of forcing my own world now
I'd rather wait on you

Chorus:
You'll be the one to call me out
I have found that it's the only way
You'll be the one to call me out
I have found that it's the only way

I know that I have plans but you will take me every step
You have covered all my debt now
And I have realized these empty fames that people crave
Are based on hopes of what they've made now
I'd rather wait on you

[Chorus:]

Well there's more than what I'm feeling
Well there's more than what I'm feeling

[Chorus:]
