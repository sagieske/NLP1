Song:

Na na na Na na na Na na 2x
Talkin'bout you and me, yeah
And the games people play.

Oh the games people play now
Ev'ry night and ev'ry day now
Never meaning what they say, yeah
Never saying what they mean.

First you whine away your hours
In your concrete towers
Soon you'll be covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine.

People walking up to you
Singing glory hallelujah
Then thy try to sock it to you, oh
In the name of the Lord

Na na na Na na na Na na 2x
Talkin'bout you and me, yeah
And the games people play.

Oh

Oh the games people play now
Ev'ry night and ev'ry day now
Never meaning what they say, yeah
Never saying what they mean.

And they teach you how to meditate
Read up your horoscope and change your faith
And furthermore to hell with hate
Come on and give me some more, and more, and more.

Na na na Na na na Na na 2x
Talkin'bout you and me, yeah
And the games people play.

First your're giving up your sanity
Turn your back on humanity, yeah
And you don't give a damn, a damn, a damn

Oh
Na na na Na na na Na na 2x
Talkin'bout you and me, yeah
And the games people play.

Talkin'bout you and me, yeah
And the games people play.
