Song:

Well it was Friday in the P. M.
And just like every weekend
I was ready to throw down
Yeah get a little tore up
So I call my bros up to meet me out on the town
Well wild man Willy said I like to really but Idol was on tv
And Ray had a date with his wife and Nate quit drinking but he didn't tell
Me

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock & roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled, "Who wants to dance?" and fired up the band with with a Franklin
And a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
"What's it gonna be are you gonna let me to party alone?"

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
Yeah it's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?
Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
Yeah it's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Come on, come on
Get your good time on
Let's have a little fun tonight

Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
Let's have a little fun tonight
