Song:

Now, baby, when you sigh
(When you sigh)
I wanna sigh with you
And when you cry
(When you cry)
Wanna cry me some too

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love
(Oh, ain't that love)
That I feel in my heart for you
(That I feel)

And when your friends
(When your friends)
Turn their back on you
Well, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Just to see you through

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)

Ain't that love, oh baby
Ain't that love, baby
That I feel in my heart for you

Now when you walk
(When you walk)
I wanna walk with you
And when you talk
(When you talk)
Wanna talk me some too

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love
(Oh, ain't that love)
That I feel, deep in my heart for you
(That I feel)

And if you ever
(If you ever)
Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(Be with you)
Yes, until the end

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)

Don't you know, baby
Don't you know, child
Ain't that love, baby
That I feel in my heart for you
Talk to me awhile

Baby, won't you let me hold your hand?
Want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need me by your side
To protect you and to be your guide?
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to

Now, ain't that love
(Ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(Ain't that love)

C'mon now, c'mon now
C'mon now, c'mon now
Ain't that love, baby
That I feel in my heart for you

Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you, oh
