Song:

Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Now you say you've found someone a lot better
That's the way it happened every time before
And as sure as the sun shines up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Oh, it's crying' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time
