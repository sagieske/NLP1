Song:

Oh! Castrop city, bitch! 
Eskimo Callboy 2014! 

Who pays for all your drinks while shaking all that things?
Who's aiming at dem kisses but only get the pinks?

It is EC! What?
It is EC! What?
It is EC! What?
Motherfucking EC! 

I tell you: Here we are again and this is where we stay
We love you more than ever but we made metal gay! 

It is EC! What?
It is EC! What?
It is EC! What?
Motherfucking EC! 

Let's go! With the motherfucking EC! 

We are fucking EC! The way we wanna be! 
We are fucking EC! Jump the fuck up! 

We are fucking EC! The way we wanna be! 
We are fucking EC! You won't bring us down! 

Hahahaha
Prepare your moves! 
Are you motherfuckers ready?
Let's bring shit down!
