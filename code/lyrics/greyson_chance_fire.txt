Song:

No it don't, come easy.

No it don't come fast.

Lock me up inside your garden.
Take me to the riverside.
Fire, burning me up,
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me whole

There you were, in your black dress
Moving slow, to the sadness.
I could watch you dance for hours.
I could take you by my side.
Oh Fire, burning me up,
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me Ooooh the fire, is burning me upp.
Oooh the fire.

No it don't, come easy.

No it don't come fast.

Lock me up inside your garden.
Take me to the riverside.
Fire, turning me on,
Desire, taking me so much higher
And leaving me whoooooollllllleeeeeee.

Leaving meeeeee whole.
