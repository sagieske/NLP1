Computerized
(Digital love)
Computerized
Oh, baby, a beautiful love

Computer love
(Computer, computer love)
Computer love
(Lookin’ for my computer love)

Computer love
(Hey)
Computer love
(Computer love)

You know I've been searching for someone
Who can share that special love with me
And your eyes have that glow
Could it be your face I see on my computer screen?

Need a special girl
(Ooh, yeah)
To share in my computer world
I no longer need a strategy
Thanks to modern technology

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop, I wanna love you, baby, computer love
Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop, my computer love

You know I've been around
From hot s*** mamas to cool Prima Donnas
I wanna share your treasure, oh so rare
‘Cause it’s your face I see on my computer screen

Oh, won’t you keep me warm tonight?
You are such a sweet delight
I will cherish the memory of this night
Yes, I found my computer love

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop, I wanna love you, baby, computer love
Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop my computer love

Digital love
(Digital love)
Computer love
(Computer love)

Digital love
(Digital love)
A beautiful love
(Beautiful love)

A digital love
(Digital love)
Digital love
(Digital love)
It’s just computer
Digital, beautiful, beautiful love

You are my computer love
(Hey, hey)
You are my computer love
(My computer love)

You are my computer love
(My computer love)
Yes, I found my computer love

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop, computer love
(Shooby doo doo doo)

You are, you are
(Shooby doo doo doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo computer)
You are, you are
(Do we mean it?)
(Do we mean it?)

You are, you are
(Do we feel it, yeah?)
You are, you are
(Feel it)

You are, you are
(You, oh)
You are, you are
(Do I know?)

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you
Shooby doo bop, computer love

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop, I wanna love you

Shooby doo bop, computer love

Shooby doo bop, shoo doo bop
I wanna love you
