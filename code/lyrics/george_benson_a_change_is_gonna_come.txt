Song:

I was born by the river
In a little tent, and o
Just like that river
I've been running ever since

It's been a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

I go to the movie and I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin me
Don't hang around

It's been a long time coming, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he wind up (knocking) me
Back down on my knees

There have been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

It's been a long time, but I know
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
