Song:

Hear the silent siren’s song
A moment of calm before the storm
My heart so violently beats along
Leading me to want to end it all

I weep for the dream
In a grave
The one that made all lips go blue, blue

I read the words on torn down walls
Reminding me how much I loved you

I weep for the dream
In a grave
The one that made all lips go blue

I leave
Bleeding
Yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue
It’s all for you
Blue
It’s all for you

Weep for the dream
In a grave
The one that made all lips go blue
I leave
Bleeding
Yet another day
The one that made all lips go blue
It’s all for you
Blue
It’s all for you

And the siren sighs
It's song
