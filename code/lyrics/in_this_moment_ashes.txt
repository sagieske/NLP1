Song:

As your eyes start to bleed, you realize it's too late
And as your sky starts to fall, you realize you're standing alone

The time has come for this to bleed
The opening of what you've always known is growing near

All you've feared here
Looks you in the eyes
We all fall down

Skies are falling tonight
As you run and hide
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

The wrath of your hate has returned
The plague is reaping back
Three-fold of what you've already sown

All you've feared here
Looks you in the eyes
We all fall down

Skies are falling tonight
As you run and hide
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

It is said hail and fire mixed with blood
Will be thrown down upon the earth
Darkness fills a third of the lands
And the angels cry woe
A star from heaven is thrown from the sky
Destroying a third of our seas
Not only these things but more will come
It is our fate, it is the end
Apocalypse

We die here tonight
You die here tonight
We all die here tonight

Skies are falling tonight
As you run and hide
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

Ashes to ashes
We all fall down
