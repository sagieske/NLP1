Toros
Let's go To-Ros!
Let's go To-Ros!
Let's go To-Ros!
Let's go To-Ros!
Let's go To-Ros!

Toros
Oh yeah!
We bad!
We got the team, we can't be had!
We're the best so score them point,
You win the game,
We'll rock this joint

Clovers
We're sweet!
We're the team,
We can't be beat,
We're the best,
Our team's too cool!
We got the a** to rock this school

Toros
Go Toros, go Toros, go, go, go Toros

Clovers
Go Clovers, go Clovers, go, go, go Clovers

Toros
Our game is fierce,
And we are hip,
So get on back You can't touch this!

Clovers
Our game is bad,
We're with our peers,
So get that weak a** outta here!

Tryin' to sell our bit,
But you look like s**t!
When we're the ones who down with it!
