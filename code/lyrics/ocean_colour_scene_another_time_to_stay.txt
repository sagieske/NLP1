Song:

Had another dream, oh yeah
The play was rolling slowly
Had another dream, oh yeah
But I could not see you only

Just hold me
'Cos lying in your arms it's you I have
Yeah, lying in your arms it's you I have

This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
Though I don't think my dreams will see the day

All of us bring a smile
Mine's broken, please stay

Had another dream, oh yeah
The play was rolling slowly
Had another dream, oh yeah
But I did not see you only

Just hold me
'Cos lying in your arms it's you I have
Yeah, lying in your arms it's you I have

This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
Though I don't think my dreams will see the day

All of us bring a smile
All of us bring a smile
All of us bring a smile
Mine's broken, please stay

This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
This is another time to stay
