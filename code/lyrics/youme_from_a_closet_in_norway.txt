Song:

I would rather be any place but here
Spin the bottle on roll the dice my dear
Cause I can't care I can't seem to break my fall
It seems I would rather be any place at all
So if the world is round, now why can't we have everything?
Cause the highs are so high, these lows are killing me, killing me, killing me

I remember when, wind would make me cry
I remember when, wasn't afraid to die
I wish I'd never, never fallen in line
So take this soul I sold
I'm going back in time
So if the world is round, now why can't we have everything?
Cause the highs are so high
These lows are killing me
Killing me, oh they're killing me

Seems that dying are the only ones
That really know how to live
It seems that dying are the only ones
That really know how to live
Seems that dying are the only ones
That really know how to live
It seems that dying are the only ones
That really know how to live
