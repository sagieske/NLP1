Song:

Appearances deceiving
Signs can be wrong
But there are no bad decisions
Just trust and move along
This is life honey pie and you don’t want to regret it
We confide take a dive and you never will forget it

Don’t deny gonna "something" before our time
Things that you will find out, find out
Things that you will find out, find out
You may cry as you watch them pass you by
Things that you will find out, find out
Things that you will find out, find out

There is no simulation
No second hand news
You cannot fake an interest
It's only up to you
Never love just because you have trouble with commitment
You f****d it up if you think you were acting in your interest

Don’t deny gonna "something" before our time
Things that you will find out, find out
Things that you will find out, find out
You may cry as you watch them pass you by
Things that you will find out, find out
Things that you will find out, find out

You are still here
Admit that you belong
You should let it go
To bring us close, bring us close

To bring us close, bring us close

Don’t deny gonna "something" before our time
Things that you will find out, find out
Things that you will find out, find out
