Song:

Alone at a table for two
Alone, waiting for you
I ordered the wine
Like so many times before
Then a chill crawled all over me
My God, this is how it would be.

If you, just didn't love me, any more
I never knew how much I loved you
Until I sat here all by myself
You know you control
My heart and my soul.

There'll never be anyone else
So don't be surprised
At these tears in my eyes
It's a feeling I've never known
Now I can see
I was never meant to be alone.

Alone, I'd never stand tall
Alone, I'd be nothing at all
Your empty chair nearly scared me to death
And then you walked through that door
And my heart, started beating once more.

Oh please, don't ever leave me here like this
I never knew how much I loved you
Until I sat here all by myself
You know you control
My heart and my soul.

There'll never be anyone else
So don't be surprised at these tears in my eyes
It's a feeling, I've never known
Now I can see
I was never meant to be alone.

It's a feeling I've never known
Now I can see
I was never meant to be alone
Oh, now I can see
I never want to be alone...
