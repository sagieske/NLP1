Song:

One min bro let's do it from the start...

1, 2, 3, 4...

We were 3-4 friends
We used to flirt with girls together
And got beaten up together
Palla went First
Aeru followed
Now Sanga is moving to Dubai
Left: Gill and Guitar

Palla and I had terrible luck
We went around but found no gal
/** I don't know **/
We were intoxicated
That one day we'll be alone
We didn't know

We were 3-4 friends
We used to flirt with girls together
And got beaten up together
Palla went First
Aeru followed
Now Sanga is moving to Dubai
Left: Gill and Guitar

Aeru was tall and I was short
I was very evil, he was lesser
We used to fight and not talk for days
Now we can't share grief even when we want

I met a vagrant yesterday
He said, listen to me, open your ears
When you can't see what's ahead
You turn to see what's gone by

Sanga was a strong man
Fear or worry never came near him
He called me yesterday, after a long time
Said that the days pass through
But the evenings don't

We were 3-4 friends
We used to flirt with girls together
And got beaten up together
Palla went First
Aeru followed
Now Sanga is moving to Dubai
Left: Gill and Guitar

Oh, my friends...

Oh, my friends...

Oh, my friends...

Oh, my friends...
