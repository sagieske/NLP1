Song:

Attention, Attention everyone!
I got a couple of things
I would like to get off of my chest
Haha
Friends!
Who the f**k needs them?

You know who you are!
Eh hmm.
Caught like a fly
In a web of your lies
It's truth be told now
Or it's meet your demise!

So how did it feel?
When you held the knife
That you stuck right in my back
A thousand times!

Your grandfather would probably roll in his grave
If he knew of that person that you had became!
I will not just lay down and take this!
Not again, not again.

You have left my heart, black and blue
Just like your father did to you!

How does it feel, knowing you're buried alive
See through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
There I was, strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me.

And when you die,
I won't be at your wake
No eulogy from me,
Just a smile on my face
And while God might be busy,
With judging your soul
I will have slept with the girl,
That you loved most!

You have left my heart, black and blue
Just like your father did to you!

How does it feel, knowing you're buried alive
See through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
There I was, strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me.

Whooaaa

Now how does it feel, knowing you're buried alive
See through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
There I was, strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me.

I'm no f*****g saint
But at least I'll f*****g sing about it.
Oh, the edacity!
