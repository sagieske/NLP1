[Music : Napalm Death]
[Lyrics: Nick Bullen, Justin Broadrick]
Feel my hate for you and your kind,
for the shit you believe in your minds.
You feel nothing - you just lied to me.
You have no emotions - just satisfied smiles.
Abattoir
Your mind is like an abattoir
You used me like a lamb for slaughter.
I never believed a word you said.
I'll piss on your grave - laught when you're dead.
