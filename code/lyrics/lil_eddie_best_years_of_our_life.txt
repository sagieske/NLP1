Song:

Keeping me inside of a circle will only make me break away
Why walk a million miles I could just take a plane
They say play it safe it's not a race

But for me it's always now or never
I'm in reach, do my thing
You can promise me forever

Buckle up for the ride ahead
There's a long way to go from here
I'm so ready now that you're not afraid of heights
Everyone's saying slow down
Don't go too fast make it last
They don't know I already know to take my time
These are the best years of our life
Ohh yeah

If you tell me wait that's my cue
I will take it and go not afraid at all
You can bet I will make you say yes
Don't need no's anyway
When I fall get back up

Cause for me it's always now or never
I'm in reach, do my thing
You can promise me forever

Buckle up for the ride ahead
There's a long way to go from here
I'm so ready now that you're not afraid of heights
Everyone's saying slow down
Don't go too fast make it last
They don't know I already know to take my time
The best days of our life

I wanna rule the world

I don't need wings to fly

Welcome to the best days of our life

Buckle up for the ride ahead
There's a long way to go from here
I'm so ready now that you're not afraid of heights
Everyone's saying slow down
Don't go too fast make it last
They don't know I already know to take my time

The best days of our life
