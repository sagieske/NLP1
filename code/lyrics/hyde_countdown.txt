Song:

Embraced in all desires
Hoshi garu karada tsukiru made
Hayaku nukedasu nara nogasenai moment
To save you from the dark

I want it higher.
To get into his light.

Stay on my side mabushii sekai wo misetai
Let us exceed mou jikan ga nai are you in?

13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Afraid of all the science
Soredemo motomeru shinka shitai
Shizumu seijaku kara shinobiyoru countdown
It is the final call!!

I want it higher.
To get into his sight.

Stay on my side kara wo hikisaite change our fate.
Let us exceed chi no hate made are you in?

I wanna be there.
Need to be closer.
I want it higher.
To get into his light.

Stay on my side mabushii sekai wo misetai
Let us exceed mou jikan ga nai todoke!

Stay on my side genkai wo ima koete
Frail is the world yume ja nai sa are you in?

13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
