Song:

He was a cowboy in an Indian bar
Not a real cowboy - but I think you know what I mean
She wasn't no movie star, but then again
She wasn't exactly green
He said like it hot?
She said I like it on fire
He said ready or not
She said I'm ready, baby
Come on, I'm ready, baby, make me out a liar
And the walls exploded into a white smoke-screen
Well, not exactly - but I think you know what I mean
She was a country girl - never been no where
Straight from the woods - I think you know what I mean
Told her sister she was out of there
Next stop Hollywood - barely seventeen
And a voice said Need a job?
She cried desperately
It whispered bow your head
She said oh Lord,
I never thought that this could happen to me
And her spirit kind of floated away in a muddy slip stream
Well, not exactly - but, I think you know what I mean
He was a movie star turned president, not like Eisenhower or Deniro
But, I think you know what I mean
Tried to convince us he was heaven sent
With that carny smile and a missile in his sleeve
He says feed the poor yeah, feed em to the lions
Were screaming even up the score
Hes screaming back, now, were number one, and we aint even trying
And, now, aint you proud to be part of the American dream?
Well, not exactly - I think you know what I mean
I think you know what I mean
I think you know what I mean
