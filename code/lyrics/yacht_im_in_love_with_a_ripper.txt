Song:

Well, I've been so lucky it can be discouraging
It's such a pity, checking my bruise
So lost and lonesome, I woke up before you
We move like lightning and put our fist to the wind

We've been so lucky; I'm always wondering
If this world is a dream or if this dream is a world
I'm in love with your brains, you are a genius
And I don't say that about anyone

Well, I've been so lucky to even know you
Everything you touch turns to gold.

Well, I'm in love with a ripper
(I'm in love with a ripper)

I got told to marry a doctor
I'm in the jungle and I don't care (I don't care)
Because I'm ripping without a proctor
Just my heart and the find of air (find of air)

Don't fret about my own doctor
Just two kids in our underwear (underwear)
Or are we a f*****g earthquake?
In our world, we are millionaires (zillionaires)

Everday is a future memory
And I have no fear of growing old (growing old)
In any case, I'm always listening
When you say, "We'll turn to gold."

Well, I'm in love with a ripper
(I'm in love with a ripper)
