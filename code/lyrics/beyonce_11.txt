Song:

If I ain't got nothing, 
I got you, 
If I ain't got something, 
I don't give a damn, 
Cause I got it with you, 
I don't know much about algebra, but I know
1+1, equals 2
And it's me, and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

Cause baby we ain't got nothing without love.
Darlin' you got enough for, 
The both of us.
So come on baby, 

Make love to me, 
When my days look low, Pull me in close, 
And don't let me go, 
Make love to me, 
So when the world's at war, 
Let our love heal us all, 
Right now baby, make love to me, 
Me, me, me, me... Oh... ohh
Make love to me... 

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I, 
I've been shot by you! 
Hey, and I don't know when I'm gone die but I hope, 
That I'm gone die by you! 
Hey, I don't know much about fighting, but I, 
I know I will fight for you! 
Hey, just when I ball up my fists I realize, 
I'm laying right next to you, 

Baby we ain't got nothing but love, 
And Darlin' you got enough for, 
The both of us, 0oohh... 

Make love to me, 
When my days look low, Pull me in close, 
And don't let me go, 
Make love to me.
So when the world's at war, 
Let our love heal us all, help me let down my guard
Make love to me, 
Me, me, me, me... Oh... ohh
Make love to me, 
Me, me, me, me...
