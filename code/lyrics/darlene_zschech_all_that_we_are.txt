Song:

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You took up Your cross, gave it all for us, so that we might know grace
You gave up Your crown, an act so profound, we'll never be the same

We'll never be the same
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The fight is now over, war has been won, the power of Your Name
Jesus the Christ has made us alive, we'll never be the same
We'll never be the same
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
[X2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What a sacrifice, that You laid down Your life
To save a sinner's heart like mine
I surrender all, all to You my God
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah to Your Name
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
[X2]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
