Song:

David Soul - Don't give up on us baby

Don't give up on us baby, don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just for the night, it's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars, we can't change us.....

Don't give up on us baby, we're still worth one more try
I know we put the last one by, just for the rainy evening
When maybe stars are few, don't give up on us I know
We can still come through

I nearly lost my head last night, you've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left, even so

Don't give up on us baby, lord knows we've come this far
Can't we stay the way we are, the angel and the dreamer
Who sometimes plays a fool, don't give up on us I know
We can still come through

And painted on the stars, we can't change us
Don't give up on us baby, we're still worth one more try
I know we put the last one by, just for the rainy evening
When maybe stars are few, Don't give up on us baby I know
We can still come through

Don't give up on us baby, don't give up on us baby
