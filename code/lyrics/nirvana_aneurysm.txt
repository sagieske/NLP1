Song:

Come on over, and do the twist
Ahhhh haaaaa
Over do it, and have a fit
Ahhhh haaaaa
Love you so much, it makes me sick
Ahhhhh haaaa
Come on over, and do the twist
Ahhhhh haaaa

Beat me outta me, (beat it, beat it)(x8)

Come on over, and do the twist
Ahhhh haaaa
Over do it, and have a fit
Ahhhh haaaa
Love you so much, it makes me sick
Ahhhh haaaa
Come on over, and shoot the shit
Ahhhh haaaa

Beat me outta me, (beat it, beat it)(x8)
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAHH

She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart (x8)
