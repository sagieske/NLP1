Song:

I remember when I was a child
My daddy said to me
We want you to grow up, son
A-lovin' your mom and me
But there's gonna be hard times
When you bound to feelin' low
And there's a place of jubilation
Where the ragged people go

It's over on a back road
On the other side of town
In the quiet of the evening
Sometimes you can hear the sound
We'd all sit and listen
And Mama'd say, "Baby don't you know
That's the people's jubilation
On Dowdy Ferry Road"

They're singing it on the corner
Dancing in the street
Movin' to the music
Swayin' cheek to cheek
If you get the feeling
You'll never want to go
You'll want to live forever
On Dowdy Ferry Road

I saw her through a window
A-starin' back at me
I ask her what her name was
She told me Sara Lee
And as we were walkin'
She said, "Teach me to be free"
I said, "The only place to go
Is down Dowdy Ferry Road"

We're singing it on the corner
Dancing in the street
Movin' to the music
Swayin' cheek to cheek
I heard her softly sayin'
"I love you, don't you know?
And we could live forever
On Dowdy Ferry Road"

Singing it on the corner
Dancing in the street
Movin' to the music
Swayin' cheek to cheek
If you get the feeling
You'll never want to go
You'll want to live forever
On Dowdy Ferry Road

Singing it on the corner
Dancing in the street
Movin' to the music
Swayin' cheek to cheek
If you get the feeling
You'll never want to go
You'll want to live forever
On Dowdy Ferry Road

Singing it on the corner
Dancing in the street
Movin' to the music
Swayin' cheek to cheek
If you get the feeling
You'll never want to go
You'll want to live forever
On Dowdy Ferry Road
