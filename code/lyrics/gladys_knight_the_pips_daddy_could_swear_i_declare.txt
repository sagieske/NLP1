Song:

Yeah, ooh, my mercy

Oh, how I remember daddy
He was young and had a built in tan, yeah
And though he only stood about a five feet seven
My daddy was a heck of a man, yes, he was, y'all

He loved us all and we knew it, yeah
Though he showed it in a very funny way
For most of the time he was a-cussin' and fussin'
When he said what he had to say

Daddy couldn't read, daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
I declare, ooh, have mercy

I still remember seein' him in the backyard
Just a-pickin' and a-paintin' away
Ooh, my brothers and sisters still talk about
How daddy lost his temper that day
You see, he built a picket fence from the garage to the house

Well, Sam, tell me what I say
The same day the garbage man backed into the fence
And the whole darn thing gave way
You should have been there

Daddy couldn't read, daddy couldn't write
One thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all

Tell 'em about, tell about your daddy
My daddy was a bad mouth, y'all
Watch ya say, watch your mouth
My daddy was a bad mouth, y'all
Watch ya say, watch your mouth
My daddy was a bad mouth, y'all
Watch ya say, watch your mouth

My, my, my, my daddy wasn't no scholar, no
No, he didn't have Phd.
But in my eyes and deep down in my heart
My daddy means the world to me

He'll probably go out talkin' about daddy
Cursin', just a-fussin' and a-bein' mad
But I hope the good Lord will understand
That daddy's is just bein' my dad

Daddy couldn't read, daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
I declare, y'all
Yes, he could
He could swear
I declare

Have mercy
Cursin', just a-fussin', I declare
That my daddy's
He could swear, y'all
Talkin' about daddy, I declare, y'all

That my daddy's
He could swear
Talkin' about daddy
I declare, y'all

That my daddy's
He could swear, y'all
Talkin' about daddy
I declare, y'all
