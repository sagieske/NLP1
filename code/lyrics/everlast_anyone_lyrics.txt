Song:

I got my pick up truck and I got my gun
And I got a taste for whiskey and pills
I know I'm kinda fucked 'cause I'm my father's son
And I gotta hole in my heart I can't fill

Turn off the parking lights
Down by the river's edge
This is my darkest night, girl
You're swimming in my head

It happens all the time
I blow it every time
People change with time
Call me anytime, girl

I miss you, oh, so often
And what's been said is done
It's my only option
Girl, I'll be anyone for you
Anyone

Out on the interstate
Play my radio and I confessed all my sins
Been driven seven hours
Still got three to go
It always ends where it begins

You got your broken wings
I got my sewn up heart
Girl, all these fucked up things
They keep us torn apart

It happens all the time
I blow it every time
People change with time
Call me anytime, girl

I miss you, oh, so often
What's been said is done
(Said is done)
It's my only option
I'll kill anyone for you

Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you
Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you
Anyone, anywhere, anytime for you
