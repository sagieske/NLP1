Song:

You know I've heard it said there's beauty in distortion
By some people who've withdrawn to find their heads
Now they say that there is humor in misfortune
You know I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead

Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

You know some people say that values are subjective
But they're just speaking words that someone else has said
And so they live and fight and kill with no objective
Sometimes it's hard to tell the living from the dead

Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

You know I used to weave my words into confusion
And so I hope you'll understand me when I'm through
You know I used to live my life as an illusion
But reality will make my dream come true

So I'll keep fighting to live till there's no reason to fight
And I'll keep trying to see until the end is in sight
You know I'm trying to give so c'mon give me a try
You know I'm dying to live until I'm ready to die
