Song:

My mind isn't quite sure
What is has bargained for.
But my heart is in time with
With the consistent beat.

This dream is sneaking up on me
No matter how collected I seem to be.
Is anybody ever truly complete?
Or are the better ones just better at believing?

So I'll go and say you're with me.
I know it's just the beginning.

At times I feel cold and exposed under a microscope
But it has never felt much better to live.
It doesn't matter if all my friends latch on to this.
There's only one acceptance that's not later dismissed.

Just go and say you're with me.
I know it's just the beginning.

My mind isn't quite sure
What is has bargained for.
But my heart is in time with
With the consistent beat of yours.

I'm not looking to music to complete me.
I'm not looking for a new philosophy.
I'm not waiting for somebody to swoon me.
I'm just searching for a better way into your love.

Can you feel the only eyes that see inside?
Can you feel anything anymore?
