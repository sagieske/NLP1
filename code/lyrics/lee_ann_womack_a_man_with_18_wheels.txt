Song:

He's been gone for ten long days
Burnin' up that interstate
He's got a run from coast to coast
I've got one more night to go

I love a man with 18 wheels
Seventy feet of polished steel
Baby makes his livin' on the road
Well he just called from Baton Rouge
One more stop and he'll be through
Then he's mine until it's time to roll
Well his home away from home
Is in the house that Peter built
Oh I love a man with 18 wheels
I love a man with 18 wheels

I can't wait to hear that sound
Of that big diesel gearin' down
We're gonna act like lovesick kids
We're gonna make up for the nights we've missed

I love a man with 18 wheels
Seventy feet of polished steel
Baby makes his livin' on the road
Well he just called from Baton Rouge
One more stop and he'll be through
Then he's mine until it's time to roll
Well his home away from home
Is in the house that Peter built
Oh I love a man with 18 wheels
I love a man with 18 wheels
