Song:

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today, that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose
That anything goes

Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today, that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose
Anything goes, Anything goes
Anything goes
