Song:

Feel Good, I wanna feel good,
Watch me shake it off sh, shake it off,
Forget about yesterday, yeah.
Feel good, I wanna feel good,
So watch me shake it off, sh, shake it off,
Today's a better day, yeah.

Had my last fight, dumped my boyfriend,
I don't wanna work it out,
It's over and done
Went straight to the store there be shopping,
Then I got my hair did,
I felt like a million bucks but then it rained,
Oh oh, Ah ah,
I can't catch a break but I'm a be okay, okay!

Gonna hop on the next train,
Destination has no name,
I wanna leave, just break away... And

Feel Good, I wanna feel good,
Watch me shake it off sh, shake it off,
Forget about yesterday, yeah.
Feel good, I wanna feel good,
So watch me shake it off, sh, shake it off,
Today's a better day, yeah.

Sick of my boss, told em' I quit.
No notice, I just left,
I could finally do me.
Walked out feelin' free,
Where did my car go?
Parked in the tow zone...
Celebration's interupted once again,
Oh oh, Ah ah,
Can't catch a break but I'm a be okay, okay yeah,...

Gonna hop on the next train,
Destination has no name,
I wanna leave, just break away... And

Feel Good, I wanna feel good,
Watch me shake it off sh, shake it off,
Forget about yesterday, yeah.
Feel good, I wanna feel good,
So watch me shake it off, sh, shake it off,
Today's a better day, yeah.
