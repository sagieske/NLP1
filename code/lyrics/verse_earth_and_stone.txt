Song:

Staring into the sun, his eyes tearing and burning. Thoughts of that warm
Day he closed up his heart to the world. Few walked beside him, many just
Passed him by. So he'll just stay numb and sit there; quietly fall behind.

Watched a man climb a mountain, watched that man's end of time. No conversation
With the giver, his father lives only in his mind. Took a chance to see her.
F****d up her world. He never wanted nothing.

So f****d up on the inside, too much to show. No bandage for these wounds
Or the ones he cut deeper than his own. He smiles and waves from a distance.
Come in closer to see him broken. Touch the face that's true in focus.
Feel the lines he cut through time. To remember the one that he's left
Behind. No chance for redemption, saw his time come and go. He wished for the
Best man to save her from his spell. Conversed with Earth and Stone
"why did you leave me alone?" He Fell to his knees and he lost himself.

Watched a man climb a mountain, watched that man's end of time. No conversation
With the giver, his father lives only in his mind. Took a chance to see her.
F****d up her world. He never wanted nothing.
