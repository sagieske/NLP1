Song:

Who's that jumpin' out the sky
Are-E-Y Mysterio
Here we go
When the mask out
The girls they pass out
The boys just black out
Better tap out
Go!
Off the top ropes
Look out below
The next thing ya' know
You'll be on the flo'
Watcha' gonna do
When your on your back
From my main body slam
Aww damn your whack
Your like "What the Heck,
All of a sudden this dude's sittin' on my neck! Where's the ref?! "
Straight from the wwe
Go home and strut what you see
When you face the man of mystery
Flippin' and spinnn' and doin' it fast
You can't remove the mask
Why?
'Cause he's kickin' your a**
C'mon!
Who's that jumpin' out the sky?
Are-E-Y Mysterio
Here we go
When the mask out
The girls they pass out
The boys just black out
Better tap out
Yeah
Who's that jumpin' out the sky
Are-E-Y Mysterio
Here we go
When the mask out
The girls they pass out
The boys just black out
Better tap out
Mr. Mysterio is serious and delirious
And everybody's curious
Wanna know where he's from
Ya' know who is he
Don't know a damn thing
But he gets busy
The entertainer and your now on the stage
And it doesn't matter if your in the ring
Or trapped in a cage
When he looks like the guy is easy
But guess what
Looks like a winner to me
C'mon
Who's that jumpin' out the sky
Are-E-Y Mysterio
Here we go
When the mask out
The girls they pass out
The boys just black out
Better tap out
Who's that jumpin' out the sky
Are-E-Y Mysterio
Here we go
When the mask out
The girls they pass out
The boys just black out
Better tap out
