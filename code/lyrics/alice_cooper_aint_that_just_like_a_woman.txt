Song:

Yeah, now, Adam, was as happy as a man can be
Till Eve started messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Now, you can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Yeah, now, Adam, was as happy as a man can be
Till Eve started messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Now, you can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Yeah, Samson was the strongest man anywhere
Along came Delilah and cut off his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

One more time, Fergie (Thurston?)...

Now, you can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Ah, let's go!

Yeah, Samson was the strongest man anywhere
Along came Delilah and cut off his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Now, you can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
She'll do it every time

Ah, let's go home, Barry!
