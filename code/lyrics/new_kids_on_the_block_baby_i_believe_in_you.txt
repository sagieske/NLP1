Song:

Yeahhhhhhhh

Baby, I believe in you
And every little thing you do.
Every time we kiss
It always feels like this
I believe in you.

Baby, I believe in us
And every little inch of our trust
Whether I'm around
You never let me down
I believe in you.

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you,
But, baby, you're just so amazing
And I'm so in love girl, with you.
I believe in you.

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But baby you're just so amazing
And I'm so in love girl---with you

Oh girl,
There's something about you.

Maybe I might sound crazy
For the way I feel about you
But baby you're just so amazing
And I'm so in love girl - with you

I believe in you,
I believe in you, yeah
All the things you do,
I believe in you (It's believe in you)

I believe in you,
Hope that you believe in me
I believe in you,
I believe in you
