Song:

God this is hard, you've had no sleep, 
You've thought of nothing else for weeks
You begin your lines, you thumble with your purse

It's been eating you, 
You don't know what to do
And your lie, only made it worse

[Pre-chorus]
You can't expect him to understand
He's not a saint, he's just a man
And you know, 
That you can't change what you did

[Chorus]
But if you have forty lives
You get it right by the thirty-ninth
As it is, 
All that you could ask
All this will pass

[End of Chorus]

God, you wish like hell
You hadn't done it and you tell
Him, how much you regret it

But you're talking to yourself
You're as lonely and as desperate as a
Kettle boiling, with no there to get it

[Pre-chorus]
All the words, you meant to say
Had in the air and flown away
And vanished, 
Into the end of the dying day

[Chorus]
But if you have forty lives, 
You get it right by the thirty-ninth
And as it is, 
All that that you could ask
All this will pass

[Pre-chorus]
And if only I had've stayed, 
And if only had been there rain
And it's funny, 
What a difference then that it makes

[Chorus]
But if you have forty lives, 
You get it right by the thirty-ninth
And as it is, 
All that that you could ask
All this will pass
