Song:

Ten years old, hair running wild
Dirt on my face and a naughty smile
I was so in love with the place that I called home

Fourteen, growing up fast
Chasing boys and skipping class
Double daring on the kiss me back, scared down to the bone

'Cause there's no one that I gotta be, it all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family, my feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi, all the way back from the big city
When the sun goes down at the end of the day, nowhere else can make me feel this way
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
Feels like home

Sixteen on a jet plane
Yeah, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Way out here, it don't even rain
In the city of angels

Even though I like it here
I get scared that I'll disappear
So I close my eyes, start clicking my heels
I remember how it feels

When there's no one that I gotta be, it all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family, my feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi, all the way back from the big city
And when the sun goes down at the end of the day, 
Nowhere else can make me feel this way
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
Feels like home

It's where I learned to drive back when I was thirteen
My dad gave me the wheel then said, "Give it back to me."
Summer days down at walnut grove lake
We were thinking we were cool like '96 in the shade
Telling secrets in the southern moonlight, 
The way my mom said it's alright to roam, 
But this is home

No one that I gotta be, it all comes down to the simple things
It feels like home and family, my feet in the red clay
My heart runs like the Mississippi, all the way back from the big city
And when the sun goes down at the end of the day, nowhere else can make me feel this way
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
It feels like home
Feels like home
