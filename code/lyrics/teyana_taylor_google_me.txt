What's the word?
I'm the word on the street.
Ain't nobody hotter than me
Broads wish they was me (hot!)
I'm superb
Fly like a bird
16 with the baddest curves
Weezy checkin' on me.
I'm hot, hot.
But I'm cooler than ya jewels.
I'm a big shot
Probably seen me in the nude.
Explore a safari
You know where ya girl be.
If you wanna find me.
Baby you can google me.

You ain't even gotta ask nobody bout me.
I'm certified on the internet read about it
If you looking for me
Go and pull it up
Cause I'm a celebrity

You ain't even got a clue but it's so true.

Under the word "star"
And I shine like the deuce 6's on the car. (Bling!)
