Song:

Standing in front of the mirror
Looking at her self
Messy her ugly dress
So not a girl make up
Unbelievebly she fell in love
Deeply in a love
She change everything to get him
Everything...

She wants to be free
As Free as she used to be
Oo.. She wants to have true love
As true as it can be

Standing in front of the mirror
Looking at her self
Messy her ugly dress
So not a girl make up
Unbelivebly she fell in love
Deeply in a love
She change everything to get him
Everything...

She wants to be free
As free as she used to be
No more hiding for her feel
So she can won as far as she wants
