Song:

Forever was shorter than what I was thinkin'
Now all we have left is yesterday
I guess I wasn't what you wanted
Til' you saw me turn and walk away

But still you had me
Feeling small when I'm 6"4
Fed up with you, always coming up short
Tired of all the games you played
Funny how now you've got so much to say... To say...

[Chorus:]
But you never told me that you needed me
The way that you're telling me now
You never told me that you missed me
Til' you saw me breaking up
You never told me that you love me
Sorry for what I'm bout to say
But you're just a little too late

What did I do? What was I thinkin'?
When I gave you my everything, my life
I forgot about me and I stopped listening
Looking back I can finally see the light

You were happiest when I was all stressed out and losing hair
Reaching out for you and you didn't care
Tired of all the games you play
Funny how now you've got so much to say

[Chorus:]
But you never told me that you needed me
The way that you're telling me now
You never told me that you missed me
Til' you saw me breaking up
You never told me that you love me
Sorry for what I'm bout to say
But you're just a little too late

I know
Why couldn't you tell me when I needed to hear it before
I know
There's not much left to say

This is heartbreak hotel, and why the hell would I want to try again
There's no way that we could still be friends
Cos you never..

[Chorus:]
But you never told me that you needed me
The way that you're telling me now
You never told me that you missed me
Til' you saw me breaking up
You never told me that you love me
Sorry for what I'm bout to say
But you're just a little too late
