Song:

Speed along the highway
Hunny, I want it my way
But listen to her daddy's song;
Don't stay out to long

Oooh, we're just busy hiding
Sitting in the back seat of my car

(Looking for a ride in a hole near by
Looking for a ride in another town
Looking for a ride in a hole near by
Looking for a ride in another town)

The lazy lights are pretty
We may end up in Mexico City
But listen to her daddy's song;
Making love is wrong

Oooh, we're busy riding
Sitting in the backseat of my car

Ooooooooh..
Ooooooooh..

Oh, we was only hiding
Sitting in the backseat of my car

And when we finish driving
We can say we were late in arriving
And listen to her daddy's song;
We believe that we can't be wrong

Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong

We can make it to Mexico City
Sittin' in the backseat of my car

Ooooooooh..

Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
Oooh, we believe that we can't be wrong
No, no, no!

Wow!
We believe that we can't be wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ooooooooh..
Na, na, na, na, nanana, na, na, na
