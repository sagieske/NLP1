Song:

You must retreat now
I just can't talk anymore
Your words make me empty
Inside there's nothing left of you
Time seems to change
Thoughts I have for you
Now I'm so alive
But you seem to be
Drowning every minute
I say that's life
You say it's alright
I can't be your answer and
I don't want to follow you
Into your cloud
I am tired of being the one
To live and learn from your mistakes
I'm just so sick of my mind
It sees us like a light
Shining bright
In the middle
Don't you see us smiling now
You say that's life
I say it's alright
CHORUS
Please open your eyes
See where you sleep tonight
I hope you never call it home
But you're bound to live bound to die in it
You say that's life
I say I'll still be here
CHORUS
