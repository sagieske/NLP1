Song:

I don't need to go crazy
Runnin' round town til dawn
The last thing I need's a shoulder
To let my tears fall on
If you wanna know the truth
I'd be good as new
If it weren't for just a little
Thing or two

All I need is not to need you
All I want is not to go on
Wanting you like this
Missin' every kiss
This broken heart is bound
To make a breakthrough
All I need is not to need you

I don't need a vacation
There's no where far enough away
Any time was all I needed
By now you'll be gone
Without a trace
I need someone else
Probably couldn't hurt
But there's something
That I got to do first

All I need is not to need you
All I want is not to go on
Wanting you like this
Missin' every kiss
This broken heart is bound
To make a breakthrough
All I need is not to need you

If someone offered me
The world on a platter
Well I think I'd turn it down
There's only one thing
On this earth that mattered
At least for now

All I need is not to need you
All I want is not to go on
Wanting you like this
Missin' every kiss
This broken heart is bound
To make a breakthrough
All I need is not to need you

All I need is not to need you
All I want is not to want you
All I need is not to need you
All I want is not to go on
Wanting you like this
Missing every kiss
This broken heart is bound
To make a breakthrough
All I need is not to need you
