Song:

And I've been meaning to say this to you.
My heart isn't black and blue anymore
And your words don't mean a thing
They're sung, in vain

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly!

And if your asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some

It's raining here like it never should
And I can't help but believe it's because you're coming
You tried once to run away and you tried once to hide,
But don't come following your fantasy,
Cause you might be surprised she'll run right back inside

Maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And If you're asking if I'm over love,
You're a fool to believe
Fool to believe
Fool to believe

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And If you're asking if I'm over love,
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some

This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave
Fits me perfectly

And If you're asking if I'm over love,
You're a fool to believe
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some
