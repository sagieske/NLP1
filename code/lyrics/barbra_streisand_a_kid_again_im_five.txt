Song:

(J. Melfi & are. Perry)

I wish I were a kid again
Doing what I did again
Here I make my bit again
To be a kid again
Once more through the door
Once more as before
Into a land where I leave cares behind
Please take me back
There are things I must find
Oh, I wish I were a kid again
Doing what I did again
A kid again...
... I'm five, I'm five
I am a big girl now, I'm five
I can dress myself, I don't need mom
To help me anymore
And when I sit in my father's chair
My feet can reach the floor
See that
I'm five, I'm five
I am a big girl now, I'm five
My mother doesn't spank me just
For going without a hat
She knows darn well I'd run away
'Cause I'm too old for that
What does she think I'm three?
Not me
What does she think I'm four?
I'm more than four
I'm even more than four and a half...
I'm five!
On April 24!
