Song:

Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau
She's the witch queen of New Orleans, of New Orleans

I'm gonna tell you a story, strange as it now seems
Of zombie voodoo gris gris and the Witch Queen of New Orleans
She lived in a world of magic, possessed by the devils skew
From a shack near the swamplands made of mud-pile brick
Marie stirred her witches brew

Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau
She's the Witch Queen of New Orleans, of New Orleans

Dime or a nickel, anyone could buy voodoo of any kind
She had potions and lotions, herbs and tanna leaves
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Early one mornin' into mucky swamp dew, vanished Marie with hate in her eyes
Though she'll never return, all the Cajuns knew, a Witch Queen never dies

Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo ve veau
She's the witch queen of New Orleans, of New Orleans

Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on you
Marie, Marie, da voodoo veau, she'll put a spell on...
