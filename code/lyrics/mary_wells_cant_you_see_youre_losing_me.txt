Song:

(Baby, honey)
Can't you see you're losing me?
I can't take this misery that you're dishing out to me
The confidence I had in you is gone 'cause you've been untrue
Baby, please, can't you see you're gonna lose me?
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see you're gonna lose me?

Tears I cried, tears I hide
Your other love I know of
She's pretty, I must confess, but for you will she do her best?
Will she give you a love that's true, one truer than I gave to you?
Baby, please, why don't you come on & see about me?
'Cause I can't stand this misery that you're dishin' out to me

Baby, honey
I can't stand this awful pain that's runnin' through my heart
It's tearin' me apart
Come on & ease the pain; it's drivin' me insane
Baby, please, can't you see you're gonna lose me?
Hey baby, ooo honey
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see you're gonna lose me?
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see you're gonna lose me?
I miss a bunch of memories; come on & see about me
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see
