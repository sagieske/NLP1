Song:

So baby it's another excuse
For the way our things been going
Excuse me if I say what I mean
Cause I know I've been gone too long
So don't believe everything, 
Don't believe everything that you see
Cause baby I'm everything, 
Baby I'm everything that you need

Cause all I can offer
Is when I'm around
And take me away, and you will see
That all you get is sound
Oh oh

So maybe it's another excuse
For the way our things been going
Excuse me if I say what I mean
Cause I know I've been gone too long
So don't believe everything, 

Don't believe everything that you hear
Cause baby, I'm everything, 
I'm everything when I'm near.

Cause all I can offer
Is when I'm around
And take me away, and you will see
That all you get is sound
Wooooooh

You say, you amaze me with your songs
You amaze

Cause all I can offer
Is when I'm around
And take me away, and you will see
That all you get is sound
And take me away, and you will see
That all you get is sound
Take me away, and you will see
That all you get is sound
