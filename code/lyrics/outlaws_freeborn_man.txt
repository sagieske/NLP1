Song:

I was born in the Southland
Twenty-some odd years ago
Ran away for the first time honey
When I was four years old

I'm a freeborn man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway,
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad track.

I got a lady in Cincinnati
A woman in San Anton'
I always love the gal next door
Honey, every place is home

I'm a freeborn man
My home is on my back
I know every inch of highway,
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad track.

You may not like the way I look
You may not like my song
You may not like the way I Live
You'll love the way I'm gone

I'm a freeborn man
Home is on my back
I know every inch of highway,
Every foot of back road
Every mile of railroad
Every mile of railroad
Every mile of railroad track
