Song:

Oh yeah, hit it

Breakin’ out, I’m on a mission
I've been caught between Heaven and Hell
My guitar is my ammunition
Raise the flag, sound the mission bell

Everybody always wants control of me
The only way to get, it’s over my dead body

Take no prisoners, open fire
Battle stations
Someone’s trying to brainwash me
Battle stations

Six string shooter, hear it screaming
Slicing your head like a laser beam
It’s true love when I’m cranking the metal
It makes me, makes me, m-m-makes me cream

Never let you get between me and my guitar
No use to keep trying, you won’t get very far

Take no prisoners, open fire
Battle stations
Someone’s trying to brainwash me
Battle stations

Open fire, raise your fist
Battle stations
It’s the season to resist

Pre-programmed morons
Computer sleaze
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Never let you get between me and my guitar
No use to keep trying, you won’t get very far

Take no prisoners, open fire
Battle stations
Someone’s trying to brainwash me
Battle stations, back off, baby

Take no prisoners, open fire
Battle stations, battle stations
Take no prisoners, open fire

Pre-programmed morons
Computer sleaze
Oh, you’re mine baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Take no prisoners, open fire
Battle stations
