Song:

She barely knew your name
He was just a city
She's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing

Running from the country
She needed out but, 
He held that diamond ring.

Cause I can't sit 
Oh I can't talk
I gotta leave this town
And run to you

Curse these nights
That speak your name
I gotta leave this town
And come to you

Break ~oh~
This ~oh~
Curse ~oh~

Ha Ha Ha 

Break ~oh~
This ~oh~
Curse ~oh~

She barely knew your name

He was such a worry
No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night
She would never listen
She left it all
And headed towards the light

Oh, your eyes look tired
But love was all she knew 
Screaming out in agony
She gave her life for you

Cause I can't sit
Oh, I can't talk
I gotta leave this town
And run to you
Curse these nights
That speak your name
I gotta leave this town
And come to you

Break ~oh~
This ~oh~
Curse ~oh~

Ha Ha Ha

Break ~oh~
This ~oh~
Curse ~oh~

She barely knew your name

(Chorus)

Cause I can't say it
Oh, I can't talk
I gotta leave this town
And run to you
Curse these nights
That speak your name
I gotta leave this town
And run to you

Break ~oh~
This ~oh~
Curse ~oh~

She barely knew your name
