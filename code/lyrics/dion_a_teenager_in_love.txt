Song:

Each time we have A quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
Cause I am so afraid that we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be A teenager in love

I cried A tear; for nobody but you
I'Ll be A lonely one if you should say we'Re through
If you want to make me cry
That won'T be so hard to do
And if you should say goodby
I'Ll still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be A teenager in love

One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'Ll leran to take
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be A teenager in love
