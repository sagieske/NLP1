Song:

He's dressed up like a cowboy
Right out of Hollywood
And he's got his sights on you
'Cross the room
His line are well rehersed and
If he gets lucky soon
He'll have you believein'
That he can milk the moon.
'Cause, he's all hat and no cattle
He'll break you heart just for fun
And ride of into the settin' sun
He'll try to make you think
He's ridin' high in the saddle
He's all hat and no cattle.
--- Instrumental ---
Under that ten gallon
There's nothin' really there
Those boot have never been
Far from town
He's never rode a tractor
Or been behind a plow
He shoots a lot of bull,
But he's never milked a cow.
And, he's all hat and no cattle
He'll break you heart just for fun
And ride of into the settin' sun
He'll try to make you think
He's ridin' high in the saddle
He's all hat and no cattle.
He's all hat and no cattle...
