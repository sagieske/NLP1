Song:

You are my friend
Aa, ano hi no yume, ima demo mada wasuretenain deshou?
You are my dream
Aa, hajimete bakka, kimi wa my long lost friend
Whoa, ima tabidatsu yo!

You are my friend
Aa, you still remember the dream we had that day, don't you?
You are my dream
Aa, we'd just gotten started, you are my long lost friend
Whoa, it's time to get moving!

Every day, kono saki no shine de(shine de)
I wanna see you hikaru my soul on fire
Kore de miosame no fun days
To be the future, mezashi take over, dakara I'll dream on!
I'll go the distance
Mihatteru sora so full
Nonikoda starting
Ore ga saikou no power, full tilt!

Every day, lit up by the shine ahead
I wanna see you it lights my soul on fire
But now, we've bid farewell to those fun days
To be the future, I'll try to take over, and that's why I'll dream on!
I'll go the distance
Gazing at the sky so full
I'm just now starting
I'll use my greatest power, full tilt!

You are my friend
Aa, ano hi yo yume, ima demo mada wasuretenain deshou?
You are my dream
Aa, hajimete bakka, kimi wa my long lost friend
Whoa, ima tabidatsu yo!

You are my friend
Aa, you still remember the dream we had that day, don't you?
You are my dream
Aa, we'd just gotten started, you are my long lost friend
Whoa, it's time to get moving!

Thank you my friend
Aa, ano hi no koto, ima demo mada oboeteru kara
You are my dream
Aa, mo kondo koso momoru my way
Whoa, the distance

Thank you my friend
Aa, I haven't forgotten what happened on that day
You are my dream
Aah, next time I'll protect you my way
Whoa, the distance
