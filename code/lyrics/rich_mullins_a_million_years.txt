Song:

"Time doesn't scare me, no I'm not impressed by time
In the scheme of eternity
Millenniums don't seem to be worth much more than a dime
Except for the love that you find in it
Every minute's worth its weight in gold
Whether you're a million years young, or a million years old

And if I'm still around a million years from now
If I'd been around a million years ago
Every thing I've learned or forgotten, imagined or come to know
Would disappear into the moment, I found that love would not give out
Even if I'm still around another million years from now

And change doesn't scare me, no I'm not impressed by change
In the light of reality
These fads are just fallacies, and they all get washed away
Except for the change that brings me closer to the love that always proves
As current as tomorrow or as ancient as the truth

And if I'm still around a million years from now
If I'd been around a million years ago
Every thing I've learned or forgotten, imagined or come to know
Would disappear into the moment, I found that love would not give out
Even if I'm still around another million years from now

All the 'way back whens' and 'ever afters' spin their wheels
And love looks back and laughs at them from yet another million years

And if I'm still around a million years from now
If I'd been around a million years ago
Every thing I've learned or forgotten, imagined or come to know
Would disappear into the moment, I found that love would not give out
Even if I'm still around another million years from now

And when I disappear into that moment..."
