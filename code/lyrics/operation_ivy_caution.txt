Song:

Caution is a word that I can't understand
C-A-you-T-I-O-N was a word I could not
Understand.
Walked the dog with a real short leash,
Turned around saw the dog walk me.
Stainless steel and painted glass give me
Pulse like a hammer and mind to match.
No relief, no food, no sleep,
When you're king for a day
You're w***e for a week.
(Chorus, repeat verse, chorus)
I didn't get it then
I think I got it now
Caution my friend
Don't step in the water 'till you know you can swim.
