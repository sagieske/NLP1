Song:

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe
Mufferaw Joe

Big Joe Mufferaw paddled in to Mattawa
All the way from Ottawa just one day, Hey, Hey
On the river Ottawa the best man we ever saw
Was Big Joe Mufferaw the old folks say
Come an' listen I'll tell ya what the old folks say

And they say Big Joe had an old pet frog
Bigger than a horse an' he barked like a dog
And the only thing quicker than a train upon a track
Was Big Jow ridin' on the bullfrog's back

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

An' they say Big Joe used to get real wet
From cuttin' down timber and workin' up a sweat
An' everyone will tell ya around Carleton Place
The Mississippi dripped off Big Joe's face

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

Now Joe had to portage from the Gatineau down
To see a little girl he had in Kemptville town
He was back and forth some many times to see that gal
The path he wore became the Rideau Canal

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

Big Joe Mufferaw paddled in to Mattawa
All the way from Ottawa just one day, Hey, Hey
On the river Ottawa the best man we ever saw
Was Big Joe Mufferaw the old folks say
Come an' listen I'll tell ya what the old folks say

An' they say Big Joe put out a forest fire
Halfway between Renfrew and ol' Arnprior
He was fifty miles away down around Smith Falls
But he drowned out the fire with five spit balls

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

Well he jumped in the Calabogie lake real fast
He swam both ways to catch a cross eyed bass
But he threw in on the ground and said "I can't eat that"
So he covered it over with mount Saint Pat

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

An' they say Big Joe drank a bucket of Gin
And he beat the livin' tar outta twenty-nine men
And high on the ceiling of the Pembroke pub
There's twenty-nine boot marks and they're signed with love

Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

Big Joe Mufferaw paddled in to Mattawa
All the way from Ottawa just one day, Hey, Hey
On the river Ottawa the best man we ever saw
Was Big Joe Mufferaw the old folks say
Come an' listen I'll tell ya what the old folks say

They say Heave hi, heave hi ho
The best man in Ottawa was Mufferaw Joe, Mufferaw Joe

Big Joe Mufferaw(x4)
