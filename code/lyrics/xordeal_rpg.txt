Song:

The game is set up
The dice have been thrown
Choose your character and start right in
Beginners pick stereotypes, professionals will customize
But it's all within the limits, no way to be yourself
This is just an rpg
A scheme to rule your life
Shifted to reality
To blind your eyes and blind your mind
No matter which way you choose
The plot remains the same
It has been optimized to run on any system
There's no requirements, it fits to any shape
Results are predefined
Just throw the dice again
This is just an rpg
A scheme to rule your life
Shifted to reality
To blind your eyes and blind your mind
