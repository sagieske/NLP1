Song:

All of a sudden
The girl of my dreams
She never asks
She always screams
Do you see her face
In a puddle at my feet
As I bend down
To kiss the street
And i'll come runnin' to her
And i'll come runnin' to her
Her sleep is troubled
Her face will twitch
She wakes up angry
And I'm bewitched
Her smile is forced
She's always late
But she's not sorry
And I capitulate
And i'll come runnin' to her
And i'll come runnin' to her
All of a sudden
The girl of my dreams
She never asks
She always screams
