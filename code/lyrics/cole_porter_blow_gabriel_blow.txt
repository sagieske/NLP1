Song:

Brothers and sisters, we are here tonight to fight the devil.
Do you hear that playin'?
Yes I hear that playin'.
Do you know who's playin'?
No who is that playin'?
Why it's Gabriel, Gabriel playin',
Gabriel, Gabriel saying,
Will you be ready to go when I blow my horn?
(Refrain)
Oh blow, Gabriel blow,
Go an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I've been a sinner', I've been a skank
And now I'm willin' to trim my lamp
So blow, Gabriel blow.
I've been low, Gabriel low,
Mighty low, Gabriel low,
But now since I have seen the light
I'm good by day and I'm good by night
So blow, Gabriel blow.
[Verse:]
Once I was headed for hell,
Once I was headed for hell,
But when I got to Satan's door,
I heard you blowin' on your horn once more
So I said "Satan, farewell."
And now I'm all ready to fly,
Just to fly higher and higher,
'cause I've been through brimstone,
And I've been through the fire,
And I've perched my soul,
And my heart too,
So climb up the mountain top and start to
Blow, Gabriel blow,
Go on an' blow, Gabriel blow,
I want to join your happy band,
And play all day in the promised land
So blow, Gabriel blow.
Come on you scamps, get up you sinners,
You're all too full of expensive dinners,
Stand up on your lazy feet and sing!
(Refrain)
