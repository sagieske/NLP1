Song:

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Sing it over
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger on Christmas morning
See him in the Temple
Talking with the elders
Who marvel at his wisdom

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Down at the Jordan
John was baptizing and saving all sinners
See him at the seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And making them disciples

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Keep on pushin now
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah now
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
