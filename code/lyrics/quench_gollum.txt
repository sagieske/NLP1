Song:

I love it, I hate it
For the fire it stirs in me
My passion, soul ashen
Do I want to be set free?

When time marches on relentless
I reach for you
When pressing on seems senseless
I reach (for you)

Kill my idols
Only you can satisfy
Kill my idols
You won't let me calcify

I love it, I hate it
Like I love and hate myself
You are my golden eye
Teach me to delight in you

And you can take
You can take it all away
My fist is open
You can take it all away
