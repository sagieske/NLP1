Song:

You can see her whenever it rains
From Rome to New Orleans dancing on the graves
Burden by the heart she loves her sunglasses after dark
And every single day her little life falls apart
She's out to look so calabre and alone
She's close to hook on her dying

Just like a gothic girl
Lost in the darken world
My lil' gothic girl
Darkerside jewel are your razor cuts for real baby

You can see she's on her road to ruin
Stigmata from crucifixion on her pale white skin
Tribal pagan art she loves her tatooed egyptian mark
And every single day her love will tear us apart
