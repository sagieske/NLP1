Song:

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Lookin' at your last text
Damn did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it?
I been breakin up with girls since I was 15
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin'
I got more liquor, more ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phone saving and if so you gon hate me

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that a**
But I hate that f*****g outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples' counselin'
Open that s**t wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Goin' hard 'til I od
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are old me
Wishin' they could X and O me
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off
On the ledge and we danglin' off
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do
Body language speaks louder than verbal

[Hook: Big Sean]
When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh I love that a**
But I hate that f*****g outfit
I'm taking off her blouses
While she take off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples' counselin'
Open that s**t wide
Let me see how big your mouth is

[Outro: Big Sean]
This goes out to, uh, you know who this goes out to, yeah!

(Hey!)
