Song:

[Both]; denotes Christine and Raoul.
(Raoul)

No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here nothing, can harm you
My words will warm and calm you

Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you

(Christine)
Say you'll love me every waking moment
Turn my head with talk of summer time
Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

[Raoul]
Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe no, one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

[Christine]
All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

[Raoul]
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you
Anywhere you go let, me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you

[Christine]
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you

[Both]
Share each day with me each night, each morning,

[Christine]
Say you love me

[Raoul]
You know I do

[Both]
Love me, that's all I ask of you

(They kiss. Raoul. lifts Christine off her feet into, his arms and holds her)

[Both]
Anywhere you go let, me go too
Love me that's, all I ask of you

[Phantom]
I gave you my music, made your song take wing.
And now, how you've repaid me, denied me, and betrayed me.
He was bound to love you when, he heard you sing
(Sobs)Christine, Christine.

[Raoul & Christine]
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...

[Phantom]
You will curse the day you did not do
All that the Phantom asked of you!
