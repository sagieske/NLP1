Song:

Oh the sun is shining far too bright
For it to still be night
Oh the air feels so cold, so cold and old
How can it be light?

Oh, let's take a walk outside
See the world through each other's eyes
I wish I was your only one

I think you're beautiful but your hair is a mess
And your shoes are untied, but that's what I love best

And I, I wish I was the one,
You lonely lonely son and you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh I love you like a friend, but lets not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something more

Now the grass is so green, but I can't see anything past your eyes
I'm fixated on your smile
Your cherry lips make life worthwhile
I'm thinking these things that I'm trying to say
This life gets in my way every single day

And I, I wish I was the one,
You lonely lonely son and you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh I love you like a friend, but lets not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something more

Now the sun is fading
Now the rain is coming down
And I'm looking at your face
And you're looking at the ground
I see diamonds in your dreams
I see pearls around your neck
I see everything that's beautiful
Oh everything that's beautiful

And I, I wish I was the one,
You lonely lonely son and you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say I'm your best friend every day
But I wish for something, wish for something more
Oh I love you like a friend, but lets not pretend
How I wish for something, wish for something more
