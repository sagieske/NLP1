Song:

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
I didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

I didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Hold up (3x)

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get right outta here
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get right outta here

Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows...

Tell me if you want me to
I'll give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
'Cause you blow my mind

I promise boy that I'll be true
You're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me too

Oooohhh...
