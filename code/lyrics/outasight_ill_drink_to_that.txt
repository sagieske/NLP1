Song:

Walking in the rain trying to clear my head
The city in that never sleeps, gotta find me a bed
I’ll close my eyes and try to escape
All the lonely nights and the minimum wage
New York City sounds good right now

Times are hard so let’s drink to we what we’ve got
Take a shot and have some faith
Singing these long days will be worth it when we’re older
Weight is off our shoulders
I’ll drink to that

I’ll drink to that
I’ll drink to that

Now I'm walking through the town that made me a man
Everyone here, tries the best that they can
When the weekend comes we pour our hearts in a glass
Raise it up and cheers May the good times last
And New York City sounds good right now

Times are hard so let’s drink to we what we’ve got
Take a shot and have some faith
Singing these long days will be worth it when we’re older
Weight is off our shoulders
I’ll drink to that

I’ll drink to that
I’ll drink to that

Pour another round
This one’s on me
A toast to our love and our family
And when the day grows old
May we look back and say
That we had our fun
We lived while we’re young

Times are hard so let’s drink to we what we’ve got
Take a shot and have some faith
Singing these long days will be worth it when we’re older
Weight is off our shoulders
I’ll drink to that

Take a shot have some faith
I’ll drink to that
We got to live while we’re young
I’ll drink to that
Take a shot have some faith
I’ll drink to that
We got to live while we’re young
I’ll drink to that

New York City sounds good right now
