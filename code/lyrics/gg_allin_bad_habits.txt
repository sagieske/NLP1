Song:

Well I swear too much
I drink too many
I shoot up and smoke dope
I'm f****d up honey
I got bad habits, bad habits

And I f**k all the whores
Black and white
I molest little girls
Who are ten and tight
I got bad habits, bad habits

I'm a heighty-tighty b***h
My heart is so cold
Spend all my money
As hard as I go
I tell you a lie
Cause I'm a dirty wild b***h
I'll rape your little sister
I'm mentally unfit

Chorus:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Don't rock the boat
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad...

Habits!

I steal too much
I shoot my guns
Get thrown outta bars
I'm rowdy all the time
I got bad habits, bad habits

All the pigs that know me
They wanna lock me away
But I'm an evil wild s***
They'll never tame me
Bad habits, bad habits

It's my bloody suicide
I'm not afraid to die
I abuse my body, cut my skin
Til it bleeds with a knife
I'll piss on your hide
Cause I just don't care
You think I'm fu***n' around
You best step over here

Chorus

Habits!

Bad habits, bad habits
Bad habits, bad habits

Chorus

I suck panty hose
Beat my d**k all day
I f**k my sister
When the folks are away
I got bad habits, bad habits

I'm livin' on the edge
I get in trouble all day
I get into fights
With the boys on the streets
Bad habits, bad habits

Repeat Verse Three

Chorus

Habits!

... Habits and I like it
F**k you
