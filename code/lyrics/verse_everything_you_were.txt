Song:

So much more than just a shell
But you can't f*****g see
You love what's f*****g cool
More than the air that you breathe
You could change the hair
You could change the clothes
But this is more than f*****g style
It's the ideals that we hold
I don't need a gimmick to set my self apart
I know true revolution only starts when it's within your heart
I've watched so many go, I've watched so many change
Falling victim of a trend and going back on everything
Everything that you were
Now you just pretend, that you had never been
A part of this at all
So many change
I'll still remain!
