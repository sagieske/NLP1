Song:

The single saddest thing that I ever heard you say
Was on the day I told you I had to go away.
You said “Darling baby please, if you really mean to leave, 
Can't I just hold you for a little while longer?”
And the single hardest thing I ever had to do
Was take your arms from round me and walk away from you.
And I know I shouldn't have kissed you as a I left, 
Darling I should have been stronger.
Not with a bang but with a whimper.
It wasn't hard, it was kind of simple.
Three short steps from your bed to your door, 
Darling I can't look you in the eyes now and tell you I'm sure
If I love you anymore.
I did my very best, I've given you these years
Of love and understanding, telephone calls and tears.
But now the little things you do that used to make me love you, 
Now just cramp my heart a little and let it slip.
And we've met this sorry end from a picture perfect start, 
The romance and the running down to disconnected hearts
Of two people sad and free, who know they used to be
More than just a pair of sinking ships.
I'm not drinking any more, but I'm then I'm not drinking any less.
I can't do this anymore, oh you know I did my best.
Oh my darling, 
I don't love you anymore.
