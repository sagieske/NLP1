Song:

[Verse:]
I wanna make you smile
Whenever you're sad
Carry you around
When your arthritis is bad
All I wanna do is
Grow old with you.

[Verse 2:]
I'll get you medicine
When your tummy aches
Build you a fire
When the furnace breaks
It could be so nice
Growing old with you.

[Chorus:]
I'll miss you
I'll kiss you
Give you my coat when you are cold
Need you

Feed you
Even let you hold the remote control

[Verse 3:]
Let me do the dishes
In our kitchen sink
Put you to bed
When you've had too much to drink
I could be the man who
Grows old with you
I wanna grow old with you
