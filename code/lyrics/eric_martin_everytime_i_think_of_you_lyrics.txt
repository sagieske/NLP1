Song:

Come a little closer
Time's standing still
My heart beats alone tonight
I wonder how can we break this space
Build our/on dreams
Try to reach out across the sky
We meet in the stars tonight
Oh now, why do we chose to be lonely
Why do we chose to be sad
Everytime I think of you
I keep hoping there's a place for us again
Everytime I think of you
Why can't we reach out now
And touch each other
When lovers walk
Under the stars tonight
Why don't we
Step over time and space
Fill every dream
We can walk all across the sky
Sleep in a distant night
Oh now, why do we chose to be lonely
Why do we chose to be sad
I wonder why we do it
Everytime I think of you
I keep hoping there's a place for us again
Everytime I think of you
Why can't we reach out
And touch each other
Everytime I think of you
I keep thinking there's a place for us again
Everytime I think of you
Why can't we reach out
And touch each other
Try a little harder
Looking for another world
Walk a little further
Get a little bit better
Come and get closer and closer
Everytime I think of you
I keep hoping there's a place for us again
Everytime I think of you
Why can't we reach out
Why can't we reach out
Everytime I think of you
I keep hoping there's a place for us again
Everytime I think of you
Why can't we reach out
And touch each other
