Song:

Crying, hurting, you're broken inside
Voices tell you not to live but die
Follow Him to new life
Break the bonds, the chains that tie
Fight away those wicked lies
Follow Him to new life

Lying defeated, the future feels dim
Rock bottom feels cold again
(But hope is waiting, and love is waiting)

And hope is waiting
And love is waiting
And peace is waiting
And joy is waiting
