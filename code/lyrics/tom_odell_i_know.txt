Song:

[Verse:]
Cold hands, white light
Yellow lamps and blackened skies
Full holes in deep brown eyes
I sing you a song that I think you'll like
And we'll walk the places we always go
A million faces, I don't know
I say the words, it always hopes that our hearts are racing
(Even though)

[Chorus:] x2
I know what you told me
I know it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
'Cause every time I run (yeah)
I keep on falling (on you)

[Verse 2:]
(Oh)The way I stand
(Oh)The way I sway
The way your hair curls in the rain
The little lines that write your face
On the winter nights you'd come and stay
The way you hit me when you wanna fight
The way I yearn, the way I cry
The way our love rose with the tides
But we know we won't make up every time

[Chorus:] x2
I know what you told me
I know it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
'Cause every time I run (yeah)
I keep on falling (on you)

[Bridge:]
Oh you bring me all the things I need
I follow the rain to the rolling sea
I love you baby all the things I lay

[Chorus:]
I know what you told me
I know it's all over and
I know I can't keep calling
'Cause every time I run (yeah)
I keep on falling (on you)
