Song:

The road is high and free
Livin' life by the way I choose
The sun was always before me
The moon was always at my back, alright!

And only the strong survive
At least that's what we've both been told, girl
But we never had that, honey
Morning light on the golden dawn, alright!

Oh, girl
Onward we roll
And it's up to me
Run with the pack
Dölphenwülf!

Dölphenwülf!
