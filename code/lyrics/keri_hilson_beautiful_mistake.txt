Song:

Follow my heart but everytime I do it gets me left and lost in the dark
But I think it's clear this time I guess were just not compatible
You get me up and let me down, you give me nothing to fall on
Yeah

Now I wish that cupids arrow never hit, never went through me, through me
Wish we never crossed the line, wish I never gave you this booty
Oooh weeeee
... Two friends then lovers
Lets just call it what it is babe, what it is babe

Never thought I would say, we were a beautiful mistake
It is what it is
Csnt say it no other way, we were a beautiful mistake
It is what it is
Damn I wish I could stay but we were a
You know I'm gonna miss you by my side, but it is what it is

Awww baby

You followed your heart, it lead you to me but
In reality I don't fit the part
We gave it a...
But blew out of control, now don't get me wrong
What we had was good, I really thought we stood a chance
But that thought quickly passed

Now I wish that cupids arrow never hit, never went through me, through me
Wish we never crossed the line, wish I never gave you this booty
Oooh weeeee
... Two friends then lovers
Lets just call it what it is babe, what it is babe

Never thought I would say, we were a beautiful mistake
It is what it is
Csnt say it no other way, we were a beautiful mistake
It is what it is
Damn I wish I could stay but we were a
You know I'm gonna miss you by my side, but it is what it is

Got me hanging up, you breaking up, we can hit =it up

Aint no use to fight it, cause it's understood
Both know we tried it, didn't turn out good

Can't you see that we just a beautiful mistake, that's what we are
