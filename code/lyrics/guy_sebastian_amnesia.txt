Song:

[Verse]
I remember how it burns, how it burns
Slowly like a cigarette
It’s like water in my lungs, in my lungs
‘Cause I’m drowning in my regret
Everday is getting worse like a curse
I’m becoming insomniac
And I just can’t get over it

[Chorus:]
If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

[Verse]
These memories are like a stain, like a stain
And it’s branded on my brain
Oh I wanna fade away, fade away
‘Cause every stranger has your face
And if I didn’t know my name, it’s ok
Girl as long as you’re erased
‘Cause I just can’t get over it

[Chorus:]
If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
I wish that I could forget you, could forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

[Bridge:]
Who said it’s better to have loved
Then to have never loved at all
They were wrong, they were wrong
‘Cause nothing will ever compare

[Chorus:]
If only I could wake up and not breathe you
I wanna know how it feels not to need ya
Wish that I could forget you, forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia

[Outro:]
I wish that I could forget you, forget you
And wake up, and wake up, and wake up
With amnesia
