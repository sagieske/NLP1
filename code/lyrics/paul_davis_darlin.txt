Song:

With Susan Collins

Oh, darling
Darling, you're so fine
(Oh, oh) oh, darling

Girl, if words could say
Darling, I'd find a way
To let you know
What you mean to me
Guess it was meant to be

I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

Oh, oh, oh, darling
I'm dreaming bout you often
My girl, yeah
I love the way you soften
My life with your love
Your precious love, uh huh

You were living like half a man
Then you couldn't love but now you can
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad
More soul than I've ever had

I'm gonna love you
Every single night, yes, I will
Cause I think you're so
Doggone out of sight

Whoa, oh, darling
I dream you often
My pretty boy, yeah
I love the way you soften
My life with your love
Your precious love, uh huh

Whoa, oh, oh...

Every night, oh, darling

I'm gonna love you
Every single night (yes, I will)
Cause I think you're
Too doggone outta sight

Oh, oh, darling
I dream you often
My pretty darling
I love the way you soften
My life with your love
Your precious love

Darling, pretty darling
My darling, you're so fine
Oh, oh, oh

Darling (I think you're fine)
My little darling
(Thank God you're mine)
Oh, oh, oh

Darling
(Gonna love you every single night)
Oh, darling
(You know I think you're
So doggone outta sight)
Whoa, oh

(I think you're fine)
My little darling
(Thank God you're mine)
Oh, oh, oh
