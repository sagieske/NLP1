Song:

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fateless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
Beautiful day without you (ah)

Like rays of gold (I honestly can)
Now can I (forget the pain)

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fateless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
Beautiful day without you (without you)

Feeling spoiled
In this world
Fighting beliefs
Now can I

I
Know
My
Tragedy

Notion took about
Still I wonder how
Morning after rain
Clear away the pain

Then after all
When all are gone
It's plain to see
Just who we are
In the light of hate
The way we talk
Enacting shame
Causing harm
Defend yourself
And keep your guard
We realize
We belong apart
'Cause we entice
We've got ways of knowing

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fateless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
Beautiful day without you (ah)

Like rays of gold (in all this decay)
How can I (forget the pain)

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fatheless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
Beautiful day without you (without you)

Feeling spoiled in this world
Fighting beliefs
Now can I

When I'm alone
And all are gone
The painted leaves
Onto the sun
In the light of god
I see myself
Improving things
Oh every day
The open sky
The breathing stars
When... Come
In a world apart
'Cause in these times
There's no way of knowing

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fateless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
Beautiful day without you (ah)

Like rays of gold (in all this decay)
How can I (forget the pain)

Living on my guard (guarded)
Wind is on my neck (fateless)
Sun is on my face (have courage)
A beautiful day without you (without you)

And still I'm spoiled
Feeling refined
This beautiful day
Makes me sigh...
