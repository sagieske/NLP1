1. AFRAID featuring ATTITUDE

What they say what they say what they say (x2)

You speak out all you feel is defiance
All you need is some self-reliance
'cause this world is gonna always try us
And all you wanted was to run for cover
Well here's looking to your self and no other
We're all searching for that special something
And we keep on running

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

[Chorus:]
So afraid of what people might say
But that's okay because you're only human
So afraid of what people might say
But that's okay you'll soon get strong enough
So afraid of what people might say
But that's okay 'cause you're only human
So afraid of what people might say you're going to break
so please don't do it

You wanna spread your wings but you're not sure
Don't wanna leave your comforts
Wanna find a cure

We're afraid of who we see in the mirror
We wanna let go but it feels too pure
Who wants to be alone in this world
You look around and all you see is hurt
But the light it always finds us
If we move with a little trust

We all have the choice to take the lead or follow
I want to feel the light shine on me

(Chorus)

A diamond don't define what shine is
I don't need a Rolex to know what the time is
You got yours let me find what mine is
I'm a survivor look how strong my mind is
I stand on my own it's all me
Regardless of whatever they call me

I'm a leader not a follower
And I'd rather be paid and popular
Ride homie get your dollars up
We're in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us

Is the end of the world and we know it x2

(Chorus)
