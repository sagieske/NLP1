Song:

Rolled in last night
To the dawn, the porch, and both our floodlights
No excuse
But we were having such a good time
Why, oh why
Can't I just walk the straight and narrow
So ashamed But I'll do it all again tomorrow
Maybe you're the only one that sees
Anything good about me
Anything good about me
I found a friend
To get the number just to call you
Line was jammed I tried and tried, but could not get through
All these calls
To warn you of my scoundrel heart
But these walls
And still they can't keep us apart

[Chorus:]
And I promise to take care
And love you
If you promise to keep seeing
Anything good about me
And I swear sometimes
There's asphalt running through my veins
And let me go
And never ever pull my reins
And I'll return
With cuts and bruises, scarred but smarter
Lick my wounds
And try again but twice as hard

[Chorus:]
