Song:

I don't really need to see,
So I don't need to see so i'll paint,
I don't know, i'll paint it black.
I don't need to see,
I don't see how you see out of your window,
I don't need to see, i'll paint mine black.
I don't know me and you don't know you,
So we fit so good together cuz I knew you like I knew myself.
We clung on like barnacles on a boat,
Even though the ship sinks you know you can't let go.
I was talking like two hands knocking,
Saying '"let me in, let me in, please come out."
Black glass, dirt-based soap,
Tell yourself what you know.
My friends, oh my friends,
Bury your head i'll help you bury your plans.
Hard hit, hard to miss, problems are what a problem is.
My light came up quick, call it your asterisk,
Buried like boys in a boys first book of the stars
Saw it as satellite, constant unblinking as,
Buried in the bottom of a bottom of a blackish lake.
