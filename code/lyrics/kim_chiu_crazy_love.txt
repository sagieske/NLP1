+Crazy Love+

Kim Chiu


I hate the way you walk
Hate the way you talk
Hate the way you look at me

I hate the way you smile
Hate those big brown eyes
Cause I know they're not for me

Cause we can never be
More than friends
And it hurts me
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you

(Chorus)
And this crazy love
Crazy love
Oh this crazy love
Crazy love

I hate thinkin of you
Cause everytime i do
I just keep on missing you

And I hate the way I feel
Everytime your near
Cause its feels like time is standing still

But we can never be
More than friends
And it hurts me
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you

(Chorus)
And this crazy love
Crazy love
Oh this crazy love
Crazy love

I hate it when you're blue
And how I cared for you
Hate the way my heart desires

And I hate those sleepless nights
And the pain I kept inside
But I keep on
Pretending it's alright

But we can never be
More than friends
And it hurts me
Everytime i close my eyes
All I see is you

(Ð¡horus)
And this crazy love
Crazy love
Oh this crazy love
Crazy love

I don't know what to do
Hate me for loving you
Cause I know it's wrong for
Me to say... I love you...
