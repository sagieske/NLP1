Song:

Realizing how you’re more delectable
When sheets unfold
Your wicked pose

You’re crawling slowly on your knees
To beg for me
It makes me weak
To know this beat

Oh you gently touch me
Like nobody else could do
Oh you mesmerize me
I feel the magic in you

Look so inviting when we groove
To set the mood
Your sinful food
You taste so good

I feel the rising of the heat
That lights the mood
It burns for you
It burns for two

Oh you turn the key in me
I feel desire for you

Oh you mesmerize me
I feel the magic and the cold
Slow it down, down over me
Come slow it down
And now, come slow it down
Down over me
Come slow it down
