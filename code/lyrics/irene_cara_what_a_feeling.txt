Song:

First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind.
All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel,
Made of stone.
Well, I hear the music,
Close my eyes, feel the rhythm,
Wrap around, take a hold
Of my heart.
What a feeling.
Bein's believin'.
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life.
Take your passion
And make it happen.
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life.
Now I hear the music,
Close my eyes, I am rhythm.
In a flash it takes hold
Of my heart.
What a feeling.
Bein's believin'.
I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life.
Take your passion
And make it happen.
Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life.
What a feeling.
What a feeling I AM MUSIC NOW
Bein's believin'. I AM RHYTHM NOW
Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life.
What a feeling. YOU CAN REALLY HAVE IT ALL
What a feeling. PICTURES COME ALIVE WHEN I CALL
I can have it all I CAN REALLY HAVE IT ALL
Have it all PICTURES COME ALIVE WHEN I CALL
CALL CALL CALL CALL WHAT A FEELING
I can have it all BEIN'S BELIEVIN
Bein's believin' TAKE YOUR PASSION
MAKE IT HAPPEN
Make it happen WHAT A FEELING
What a feeling BEIN'S BELIEVIN' (fade)
