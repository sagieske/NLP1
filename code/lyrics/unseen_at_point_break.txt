Song:

Listen
Look what I see it sickens me
To no end
There's People Freezing
Out on the streets
With no where to go.
Don't take for granted what you own
No
Don't you know
Some People don't have a home

Such a dreadful outcome
A turn taken for the worse
Forgotten, beaten, battered
A life forced no one chosen

A life not chosen, no go

She works so much
she's at point break
To save her kids
Their worthless father ran away
He took everything
Now things will never be the same
It's been bled dry
Is this the American Dream?
Fuck it!

[Chorus]
We're at point break
For a life not chosen

We're at point break
Hey
For a Life not Chose
