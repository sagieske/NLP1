Song:

You can reach me by railway
You can reach me by trailway
You can reach me on an airplane
You can reach me with your mind

You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

You can reach me by Sailboat
Climb atree and swing rope to rope
Take a sled and slide down a slope
Into These arms of mine
You can jump on a speedy colt
Cross the border in a blaze of hope
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
But if I had my way
Surely you would be closer
I need you closer

There are hills and mountains between us
Always something to get over
But if I had my way
Surely you would be closer
I need you closer

You can windsurf into my life
Take me up on a carpet ride
You can make it in a big balloon
But you better make it soon.

You can reach me by caravan
Cross the desert like an Arab man
I don't care how you get here
Just get here if you can
