Song:

Boy: I was baby-sitting my little cousin, and his father has these, this little stash of these little women magazines and everything. And I made him his like really down and little child.
Man: How old was he?
Boy: 6/ 7
Man: Uh huh
Boy: Really tiny and small and innocent and he showed me the magazines, where they were, and we were looking at them, and then, I played with his little innocent p**** and I made him dance with me.
Man: Did you get a hard on?
Boy: Somewhat, it was kind of impossible.
Man: How did that make you feel?
Boy: At the time...
Man Did you feel like you were doing something wrong or did you like it?
Boy: Both. I felt very powerful. Actually.
Man: What else did you do with him?
Boy: I orally gratified and whatever.
Man: Did you suck his d**k?
Boy: Yes. I just made him do things to me.
Man: What did he do to you? Did you make him touch you or what did you make him do?
Boy: I made him do all of those things.
Man: Hmm?
Boy: I made him do all of those things.
Man: Do you want to be punished now for being bad?
Boy: Umm, hmm.
Man: Go give me your belt
