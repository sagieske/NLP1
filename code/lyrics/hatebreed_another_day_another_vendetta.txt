Song:

The question they keep asking me.
How can one so young be so bitter and angry
Well the answer is plain to see
Just look around at this world that we're living in.
It's die or let die
Take or be taken from
And there's nowhere to run
Who do we look to
What have we done
These times have taken the best from us.
All I see is killing
Another day, another vendetta
There is so much suffering
Another day, another vendetta

I see the homeless standing out on the streets
On every corner, they're asking for money
I try to help them whenever I can but sometimes
I can't afford to help myself.
I see diseases and modern plagues of our time
The greed of our leaders have made them blind
To our problems, they spend millions over seas
While people right here are fighting wars everyday

All I see is killing
Another day, another vendetta
There is so much suffering
Another day, another vendetta

All you can do is stay close to what is true to you.
Stay close to what is true to you.
All you can do is stay close to what is true to you
Stay close to what is true to you.

Never let go of what you strive for.
Hold tight, never let go
Never let go of what you strive for.
Never think you can't make a change.

All I see is killing
Another day, another vendetta
There is so much suffering
Another day, another vendetta
