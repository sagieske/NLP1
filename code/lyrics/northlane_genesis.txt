Song:

Every single moment time will melt away my life
What choices do I have, how do I know what is wrong or right?
How do I speak of what I see through my own eyes?
Without telling you that the truth youâ€™ve known is all a lie.
Stop living the lie, existing just because you can.
I can be the dreamer
I can, I am.
