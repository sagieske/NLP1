[Introduction]

Gorillaz

Back the f**k up

D12

[Proof]

There's new terrors in rock (rock)

On every block (block)

Late for school, late for work

But ahead of these cops (cops)

My credit is shot, end up dead in a box (box)

Right?, people tell my life and that's pathetic as pac's (pac's)

A waste of the talent to say my boys are just no where

Placed on the planet, remain in poisonous warfare

Derelict Arabic terrorists in the air

S**t arrogant apparent to punish people by they heritage,

Nato barriers, hate embarrassed

There is no faith to cherish

And your proved face to face with race awareness

A race to steal us the army bombin' your God is with you

Calm over war, we gotta starter pistol

Cause if you right and, know you right, then where's your ritious ways

We sacrifice, snatch your life, many nights and days

Follow me into equality we might behave

And only Christ can say the trife will reunite again

[Kuniva]

America owns, without a f*****g care in my dome

Bearin' my bones, so far away staring at home

Stay in my zone, falling asleep late with my chrome

Feelin' hype from these rockets burning like straightenin' cones

Stay at the streets, bullshit and preying for beef's

Spray at your peeps for Christmas, give a k to my niece

Real nigga's feel us and fear us

Gorillaz beat on they chest when

Dangerous lyric's, I hope that you hear us

The spirit of Bugz is still in me

God bless it the trinity

Cause my bullets they come in three's like trilogy's

Put the knife away, missiles always strike and blaze

So much smoke you can't tell the difference between night and day

Right away blow your life away, so light your haze

Hold tight grenade's so when it blows I'm slightly grazed

Kuniva might be crazed unleashin' unlikely rage

The next time you hear a verse from me I might be caged

[Chorus:]

Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa

Ahhhayayayayay

Aaaahhhiyyyaaaa

Ahhhayayayayay

[Bizarre]

Every night I talk to a black hawk, taking heroin in bulks

Watch my body hit the chalks

I'm too lazy, mescaline's got me crazy

Rape this old lady, while the b***h was having a baby

And I ain't never going home, bizarre too far gone

It's cold I'll be for cyphering, right from wrong

As I sit in my seat and remain calm

And close my eyes and wait for the bomb (here it comes!)

[Airplane blows up]

[Swifty]

I'm gettin' the f**k on, I'm aggravated

I know I'll make it, I'm in a place full of hatred

Treatin' my life like a sacred

Try to check me, I break your neck

Disrespect me you get injected

It's hectic with some bullshit happen

You least expected

We just don't accept it n***a

I go ahead, lift my trigger

Get rid of b*****s, pay you a visit, then get your s**t lit

I'm a nitwit with a big d**k, and big balls

I don't miss s**t

I hit all, whoever that did this

We gonna getch'all

[Kon artis]

Yo, yo

Now whether it's sadam or bin laden

That's been startin all this trouble for us

Creepin horrors doin show after show, sleepin on the tour bus

We lost aaliyah, lost our families, it takes no genius

You don't need us to say the world is f****d up y'all can see it

Now it seems the public needs this s**t to calm it's kids

'Cause they findin out how you lied about your twisted sins

They say we bad for you but s**t our music is your friend

They can't deter you from the truth cause we the helping hand

[Terry hall]

We are one, and one is all

We are, we are, we are one

And one is all

[Chorus:]
