Song:

Ooh, ooh, ba

Yesterday I thought you'd stay

I thought you'd see things my way

But now I see my hopes may be dead

I should have known when you said

I was the one you wanted

Wanting meant nothing more than today

(*) All I can do is cry over you

And hope you return someday

All I can do is cry over you

Ever since you've gone away

Every road that I follow

Leaves me with no tomorrow

I need someone to show me the way

Repeat (*)

Baba, baba, baba

Baba, baba, baba
