Song:

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
As soon as we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway? We're all the same

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of god at the rainbow, sweet Jesus
But we're holding on, hold on

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess times wasting, tick tocking lip locking
How do we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock them
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold on, hold love, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much â€˜cuase she's an older you
I wish you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones and ones the oddest
Couple only human except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of god at the rainbow, sweet Jesus
But we're holding on, hold on

[Outro: Ariana Grande (Big Sean)]
You're, you're, you're
(Best mistake you ever had, best mistake you ever had)
I be savin' my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're
(Best mistake you ever had, best mistake you ever had)
I be savin' my love for you, for you
