Song:

Singing out my enveloped ideas
Doesn't seem all too bad
Hoping it would be easier
To sing out my enveloped ideas

Stanza I:
Trying pointlessly to understand
Having nothing to say
Just shadows what remains boxed inside
This is what I call, my Enveloped Ideas

Singing out my enveloped ideas
Doesn't seem all too bad
Hoping it would be easier
To sing out my enveloped ideas

Stanza ii:
Why should I carry this platter? (platter)
Didn't it just pass me by? (by...)
And does one cleave right on the edge? (the edge)
I have an empty dream, this here my ideas.

Repeat Chorus
