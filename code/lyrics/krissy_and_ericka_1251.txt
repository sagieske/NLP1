Song:

Scrolling through my cellphone for the 20th time today 
Reading that text you sent me again 
Though I memorized it anyway

It was in afternoon in December
When it reminded you of the day
When we bumped into each other 
But you didn't say hi cause I looked away 

And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night

Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone 
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight 
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer 

Oh oh oh oh... 

Then I saw you with her
Didn't think you'd find another
And my world just seemed to crash
Shouldn't have thought that this would last

And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night

Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer

As the sky outside gets brighter
And my eyes begin to tire
I'm slowly drowning 
In memories of him

And I know it shouldn't matter
As my heart begins to shatter
I'm left to wonder
Just how it should have been... yeah... 

12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, I'm not thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on

Cause I'll prove you wrong that I can move on through this song
So much stronger
