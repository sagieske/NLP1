Song:

I met a girl and I really thought she liked me
I truly thought that I had met the one
It was a fail, To know a fail
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Just like a witch because her spell is hypnotizing
She made me drink a potion just to fall in love
She got me drunk and tipsy off her love
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey (x4)

She's always blowing up my phone
I really wish that she'd leave me alone
I gotta change my number
Hard for me to slumber
When she's outside my home

She called the cops and made it seem like I was mean
She's not your average lady, She is f*****g crazy
Spelled C you N T

And after all
The rise and fall
You're not worth my time

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
Youre playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxenfree
All the Bad Girls Club's here with me
Your love's a drug, You got me on the rug
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey (x4)

I'm always paranoid
That she's somehow watching me
Follows me on Twitter
Asking if I miss her
Hashtag set me free

She Google's my name
Just to keep some tabs on me
She's not your average lady, She is f*****g crazy
Someone help me please

And after all
The rise and fall
You're not worth my time

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
She's playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxenfree
All the Bad Girls Club's here with me
Your love's a drug, You got me on the rug
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

(Ronnie)
All right, All right, All right
Settle down, Settle down
I need all my bad girls in the house tonight to help me do a cheer
It goes: 1, 2, 3, 4!

(Bad Girls)
Hey s*** boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L O V E Really doesn't mean much

(Ronnie)
You're always like a drug
But it is not enough

(Bad Girls)
Give me a B A D
Were the Bad Girls Club!
Hey s*** boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L O V E Really doesn't mean much

(Ronnie)
You're always like a drug
But it is not enough

(Bad Girls)
Give me a B A D
Were the Bad Girls Club! Yay!

I'm c-c-calling it quits
Right now, This time
She's playing games
And all we do, Is fight
It's getting late so,
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie Oxenfree
All the Bad Girls Club's here with me
Your love's a drug, You got me on the rug
I'm just another victim of the Bad Girls Club

Hey (x4)
Just another victim of the Bad Girls Club (x2)
