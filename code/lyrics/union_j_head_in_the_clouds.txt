Song:

Magazines and tv screens are telling the world is going, going down
How could days are few and far between
And I don't really like the way it sounds
I think my generation is growing up complaining
I need to shake them
Honestly, I need to down it down
I think my brain is burning out

Wo-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't right now

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die
There's so much sh*t to worry about
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow

Well call me crazy, call me lazy
Maybe you can even call me ignorant
Here's a tissue for your issue
I don't care if it's on cnn
I've got a lot to deal with
I'd rather just be chillin'
It's how I'm feeling

Maybe I can worry about it all tomorrow
I just want today

Wo-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't right now

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die
There's so much sh*t to worry about
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow

Wo-oh, call me your fool
'Cause sometimes I just don't care
I don't

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die
There's so much sh*t to worry about
And that's the reason why

We all gotta do it, do it
'Cause life can be a b*tch then we die, we die
There's so much sh*t to worry about
And that's the reason why

It's why I spend all my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
All my days with my head up in the clouds
Like wow, wow
