Something caught my eye
We just turn back and run
We didn't realise how lovely it was
And we dig our own graves..
But the sand crawles back
In my eyes and my mind, there's a black hole..
Something caught my eye
We just turn back and run
We didn't realise how lovely it was
And we dig our own graves..
But the sand crawles back
In my eyes and my mind, there's a black hole..
