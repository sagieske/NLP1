Song:

Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over tv stations
Situations running through my head
Well looking back on time
You know it's clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To open up my heart
To all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridicule

Saturday and I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals are rushing in my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To show you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made

Well, If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
Feel it now

Babylon, Babylon

Sunday all the lights of London
Shining sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me

Well, If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel
Let go of your heart
Let go of your head
And feel it now

Babylon, Babylon, Babylon, Babylon
