Song:

I feel alone when you're not here
I'm standing in the darkness
I won't complain about my pain
But now it really hurts me
Give me a sign, will you be mine
Please take away those shadows
Take me tonight into the light. Don't let me be alone

Take me into the light.
It's shining through the night
Take me into the light.
Why don't you hold me tight
Take me into the light.
Into the guiding light
Take me into the light.
It's gonna be all right

I can't go on without your love
I'm standing on the outside
Clouds in the sky, they make me cry
It's time you come release me
Give me a sign, will you be mine...
