Song:

I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learnt so well
In my youth
I think I'm returning to
Those days when I was young enough
To know the truth
Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more colouring books
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can't play the game of life to win

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out
To a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do
Than watch my sail boat glide
And every day can be
My magic carpet ride
And I can't play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate
The true reality
I'd rather see the world
The way it used to be
A little bit of freedom's all we lack
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back
