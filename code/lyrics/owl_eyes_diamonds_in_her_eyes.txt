Song:

You told me I was only allowed to dream about you
I’m your lucky star, tell me I’m your lucky star
I wear your favourite dress, wear these chains around my neck
I’m the one you want, please tell me I’m the only one

I put on my best for you
I’ll undress myself for you
I will do unthinkable things for you

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Diamonds in her eyes for you
X 2

You walk into the room
Rough but oh so glamorous
You’re a shooting star, I know you’re a shooting star
This love is brutal
It cuts right through me
Cuts me like a knife, cuts me with desire

I put on my best for you
I’ll undress myself for you
I will do unthinkable things for you

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Diamonds in her eyes for you
X 2

Diamonds, diamonds, in her eyes

You leave me, try leave me clueless
You’ve got things on, guess it’s true
But I could love you more than they ever would
Love me cos I'm more than they want [?]
Let me in, I’m locked outside
All these shades you hide behind
I will show you more than they ever can
I will do unthinkable…

Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you want
Diamonds in her eyes for you
X2
