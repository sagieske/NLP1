Song:

I was looking the wrong way
When you came into my life
Like a story returned everyday
And my heart gave a warning
And it stopped for a moment
And I thought I would never get well

But the poison and passion and action of love
Running away with me huhh
The fighting and hiding your hating and love
Until you could set me free

I was caught in the middle of a rock and a hard place and
I needed a soft place to fall
Then you showed me the reason to rely on my feelings
I had nothing to fear at all

I'll never go back to that circle of one
That circle of loneliness yeahh
I'll never go back to that circle of one
Oneee!

I was looking for someway
To escape to a new life
Far away from this merry go round

Then you set us in motion
With love and devotion
And I hope that we never come down

I'll never go back to that circle of one
That circle of loneliness yeahh
I'll never go back to that circle of one
That circle of empty-emptiness baby
I'll never go back to that circle of one
Circle of
Circle of
Circle of
One! Oooohhho

The simple addition of a love in my life
The failing of a endless void
It came out of nowhere and
Stucky like a knife
It was something to fear in your heart

Never never go back no
Never never go back no
Hahhhh!
Never never go back no
Never never go back no

I'll never go back to that circle of one
That circle of loneliness yeahh
I'll never go back to that circle of one
That circle of empty-emptiness baby
I'll never go back to that circle of one
Never never go back no
Never never go back no
I'll never go back to that circle of one
Circle of
Circle of
Circle of
One! Oooohhho
