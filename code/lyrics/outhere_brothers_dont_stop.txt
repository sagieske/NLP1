Don't stop movin', baby
Only booties drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle, wiggle wiggle
Don't stop movin', baby
Only booties drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle, wiggle wiggle
Hey, hey, hey
Wiggle wiggle

Wiggle wiggle

Put your wares on my face
I love the way your booty shake
Girl you got to suck my d**k
And you got to suck it quick

Hey, hey, hey
Wiggle wiggle
Hey, hey, hey
Wiggle wiggle

Don't stop movin', baby
Only booties drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle, wiggle wiggle
Don't stop movin', baby

Only booties drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle, wiggle wiggle
Don't stop movin', baby
Only booties drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle, wiggle wiggle

Slip don't trip out how I do it malik is in the house
I turn your body into fluid as I come from the depths of doom
I snap back like pow with the boom
