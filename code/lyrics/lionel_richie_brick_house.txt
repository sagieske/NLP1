Song:

Chorus:
Ow, She's a brick house
She's aâ„¢s Mighty mighty a just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,
Ain't holding nothing back.

Ow she's a brick house
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes.

1. She knows she got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah yeah.
How can she lose with what she use
36-24-36, what a winning hand!

Chorus

Ow she's a brick house
Yeah she's the one, the only one
Built like a black amazon

2. The clothes she wears, her s*** ways,
Make an old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure 'nough to knock a strong man to his knees

Chorus

Shake it down, shake it down now (repeat 6x)
Shake it down
Chorus

Shake it down, shake it down now (repeat 6x)
Shake it

Bridge
Chorus
