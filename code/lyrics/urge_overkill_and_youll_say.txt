Song:

And you will say
If it makes you happy I'll just walk away
If it makes you lonely I'll stay
We're living this why should we run away
But we won't get that far

And you will say
You never loved me anyway
And you could leave
But that's not what I want
And you can have what's yours
And I'll just take what's mine
'Cause it's easier to lie

What'll keep us alive
What'll keep us high
What'll keep us happy

And you will say
You never loved me anyway
And you could leave
But that's not what I want
And you can have what's yours
And I'll just take what's mine
'Cause it's easier to lie

And you will say
Would it make you happy If we could just run away
I can always picture your smile
But if you leave your consience undone
A smile can get you far

And you will say
You never loved me anyway
And you could leave
But that's not what I want
And you can have what's yours
And I'll just take what's mine
'Cause it's easier
And you will say
You never loved me anyway
And you could leave
But that's not what I want
And you can have what's yours
And I'll just take what's mine
'Cause it's easier
'Cause it's easier to lie
