Song:

Everyday is so wonderful, then suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure, from all the pain
I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed, in all your doom
That's the way it is

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)
Everything we do (no matter what we do)
The sun will shine

We are beautiful no matter what they say
Words won't bring us down, no, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes words won't bring us down, no, no, oohhh
So don't you bring me down today
