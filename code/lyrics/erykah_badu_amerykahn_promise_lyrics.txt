Promise to you baby, I'll love you tooth for tooth and eye for eye
Promise to you baby, I'll love you tru and good till the day I die

Promise Promise Amerykhan promise

Promise to you baby, anything you want you know I'll buy
Promise to you baby, you will never have ask to me why

Promise Promise Amerykhan promise

Promise I'll love you till the day I die
Promise I'll love you good and give you the sky
Promise I'll never love another guy
Promise I'll give you things that you can't buy
I'll give you my nose
I'll give you my toes
I'll give you my eyes
I'll give you my ears
I'll give you my hands
I'll give you my lips
I'll give you my tongue
I'll give you my thighs
Damn near anything you want

Promise to you baby, I'll love you tooth for tooth and eye for eye
