Song:

You say that love has caused you pain
And nothing seems to ever change
And you're all burnt out
Because I cannot match you down

And every time you let love in
That's when uncertainty begins
Nothing to break your part
Seems like love don't love alone

That's not the way it's suppose to go
Love is the greatest thing between two people
If you don't open up your heart you'll never know

So baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee that you can always count on me
I will never lie to you, I'll never be untrue
So if you need someone to love you, you can count on me

So tell me what I have to do?
I've opened up my heart to you
And now it's in your hands
You decide where this love stands

And I'm convinced we're meant to be
And it's no mystery to me
So can we add this trial
To find out if this love is right?

I know you're thinking, here we go again
But this time it's gonna be so different
So don't you be afraid to let this someone in

Baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee your heart can always count on me
And I will never lie to you and I won't be untrue
So if you need someone to love you, you can count on me

People searched for all their lives
Looking for someone they never find
Fortunately you and I have found each other

I will always be there for you
Anytime you need me to
Because you can always count on me

Baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee you can always, always
And I will never lie to you and I won't be untrue
So if you need someone to love you, you can count on me

Baby, if you let me be everything you need
Then I can guarantee your heart can always count on me
And I will never lie to you and I won't be untrue
So if you need someone to love you
