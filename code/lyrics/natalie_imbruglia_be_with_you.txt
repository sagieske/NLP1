Song:

Don't you see the light has changed and nothing looks the same
Just shadows on the ground
And if you listen hard enough you'll hear
I don't wanna dream of anything that'll change all I know
Coz I don't wanna live if I don't wanna be with you

Com in here I keep you safe theres too much going on
Underneath the stars
And If I hold you close enough you'll feel
I don't wanna dream of anything that'll change all I know
Coz I don't wanna live if I don't wanna be with you
I don't wanna hurt and I don't wanna smile if you don't know
And I don't wanna live if I don't wanna be with you

I just wanna be with you
Take it all, take our turn
I want to see the world with you
I just want you by my side
If you don't mind

I don't wanna dream of anything that'll change all I know
Coz I don't wanna live if I don't wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you (x4)
