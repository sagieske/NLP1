Song:

Don't want to open your heart... You're afraid from the start,
That a new love's gonna let you down,
There was something you should know... Before you give up and go,
I don't believe in a run-around.
I just wanted to find myself and show you how I feel.

Chorus:
If a promise ain't enough... Then a touch says everything,
Wanna hold you in my arms... Do you feel what I mean.
Know that my heart just tells me what to say,
But words can only prove so much,
If a promise ain't enough... Hold on to my love.

Though my words can't describe how I'm feelin' all inside,
Does my touch say anything to you,
I'm not afraid to take time... 'cause I know you'll find,
That I'm real and my touch is true,
It's taken a lifetime to find my heart and I'd give it all to you.

Chorus:
If a promise ain't enough... Then a touch says everything,
Wanna hold you in my arms... Do you feel what I mean,
Know that my heart just tells me what to say,
But words can only prove so much,
If a promise ain't enough... Hold on to my love.

Oh, it's taken a lifetime to find what I want... I won't let it slip away.

Chorus:
If a promise ain't enough... Then a touch says everything,
Gotta hold you in my arms... Do you feel what I mean,
Know that my heart just tells me what to say,
But words can only prove so much,
If a promise ain't enough... Hold on to my love,
If a promise ain't enough... Hold on!

Promises - promises - promises - hold on to my love,
Promises - promises - promises - hold on to my love...
(Repeat and fade)
