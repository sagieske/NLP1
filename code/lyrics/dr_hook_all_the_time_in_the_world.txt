Song:

All the time in the world
Dr. Hook - 1979
(Even Stevens/Shel Silverstein)
Lay down let's explore this tenderness between us
There ain't no one around at all to see us
And baby would you mind if maybe you and I
Took a little time to find each other.
Baby we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow
We got everything we need to plant a loving seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow.
Stay down, stay at least until the fire stops burning
At least until the room has stopped it's turning
And when the embers dying low we're lying in the afterglow
It'll be as sweet as anything we've known.
Baby we got all the time in the world
So why don't we just take it nice and slow
We got everything we need to plant a loving seed
And all the time we need to watch it grow.
