Song:

The Earth, the Earth is on fire! 
We don't have no daughter, 
Let the motherfucker burn! 

We are hungry, we are all tired.
Our tongues they are all on fire.
The walls that we build are higher, higher, higher, higher.

Strange days lead to strange nights.
You aren't afraid of the dark dark dark dark
When it's where you walk walk walk walk, 
When it's where you learn to talk.

Every day the sky gets lower, lower, lower, lower, 
And every day the tide is blacker, blacker, blacker, 
And every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, 
Yeah, every day the flames get higher, higher, higher! 

The Earth, the Earth is on fire! 
We don't have no daughter, 
Let the motherfucker burn! 
The Earth, the Earth is on fire! 
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals would return.

We live like lions, we live our lives
With no more husbands, 
No more wives, 
We let our children multiply 'cause we're afraid of dying.

Every day the sky gets lower, lower, lower, lower, 
And every day the tide is blacker, blacker, blacker, 
And every day the flames get higher, higher, higher, 
Yeah, every day the flames get higher, higher, higher! 

The Earth, the Earth is on fire! 
We don't have no daughter, 
Let the motherfucker burn! 
The Earth, the Earth is on fire! 
If we cut off the water
Then the jackals would return
