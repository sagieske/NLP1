Well, come on let's go
Let's go, let's go, little darlin'
And tell me that you're never leaving
Come on, come on, let's go-a
Again, again and again

Well now, swing me, swing me
All the way down there
Come on let's go little darlin'
Let's go, let's go again, once more

Well, I love you so, oh girl
And I'll never let you go
Come on baby, so
Oh pretty baby, I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Little sweetheart
And then we can always be together
Come on, come on, let's go again

(Ritchie & Rene - guitars & instrumental) 'go on'

I love you so, oh girl
And I'll never let you go
Come on baby, it's so
Oh pretty baby, I-I love you so

Let's go, let's go, let's go, little darlin'
They're dancin' and we'll be long here
Come on let's go, let's go-a
Again, again and again and again

Again, again and again and again
Again, again and again and again

Fades-

Again, again and again and again.
