Hey hey!
This is diabolical bizmarkie
And we gonna do it like this

And I'll break ya day
Super educator in-human or destruct
Im here with the x-ecutioners

[female voice]
Im in heaven
Who you wit baby?
With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Time isn't present in that dimension
Hell take my arm
When were walking, rolling and rocking
Its one time Im glad Im not a man
Feels like Im dreaming but Im not sleeping
(scratching)
Who needs a beat when your feet just go?

Who needs a beat when your feet just go?

Raise expectations to a new intention
