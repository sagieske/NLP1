Song:

Everyone you meet, the children in the street
Are swayin' to the rhythm, there's somethin' movin' in them.
There's no place to hide, so, why even try?
Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay.
Music in our walk, music when we talk.
It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic.
Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground?
Music makes the world go around.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,
Tell the wind, don't blow, 'cause it's easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up
'cause that's easier to do.

Movin' with the wind since the world began,
The beat is gonna getcha, beat is gonna getcha.
Music for the blues, for your dancin' shoes,
There's music in the way that we kiss, you can't resist.
Movin' through the trees, buzzin' with the bees,
The sound is gettin' louder, sound is gettin' louder.
Music when we play, when we kneel to pray.
There's music in the sound of the wind.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,
Though you try in vain it's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Change the master plan, take the hope from man
'cause that's easier to do.

On the radio, on every tv show
For each and every reason, each and every season.
Music when we love for the moon above,
Music for the show of life that never ends.
Music on a plane, music on a train,
Sailing in the ocean, music in the motion.
Music in your car, at your local bar.
There's music when you look at a star.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,
Though you try in vain it's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Change the master plan, take the hope from man
'cause that's easier to do.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,
Though you try in vain it's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Change the master plan, take the hope from man
'cause that's easier to do.
