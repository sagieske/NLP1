Song:

(Verse)
She sleeps better with the TV on
She came in dark but she goes out blonde
Her mother slept with a Rolling Stone
Her lights are on but she’s never at home
She’s never at home

(Chorus)
She’s an actress tryna’ learn the art
Actress searching for a part
If you ask her, ask her what she’s in
And watch her act again

(Verse)
Still trying to figure out who she is
Sometimes she’s mine but she’s always his
She made a movie once for fifty bucks
You can still get it if you know where to look
If you know where to look

(Chorus)
She’s an actress tryna’ learn the art
Actress searching for a part
If you ask her, ask her what she’s in
And watch her act again

(Verse)
All lies, all lies
Bad breaks and broken minds
Old words of make believe
One more honey just for me

(Bridge)
(Actress…)
Tryna’ find a line
(Actress…)
Tryna’ hold back time
(Ask her…)
Ask her what she’s in
And watch her act again

(Verse)
She leaves the doorway right behind her
Her whole world is a stage
She needs to feel your eyes upon her
As she dances in a cage
The music’s pumping louder
As her mind heads to the stars
She gets clarity of thought in the back of someone else’s car

(Chorus)
She’s an actress tryna’ learn the art
Actress searching for a part
If you ask her, ask her what she’s in
And watch her act again

She’s an actress…
If you ask her, ask her what she’s in
And watch her act again
She’s an actress…
