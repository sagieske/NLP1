Song:

Rolling up this dope, I been living something like disco
All I do is spend dough, I know this b***h no more
Cause I'm balling, so please stop calling
B***h 2 key, b***h no me, b***h don't know me
Let me tell you hoes bout me
Cause I'm balling and we shoot no talking
Rock in my broke a** n****s who talk
Cause if you aint talking money you can talk
. And these broke n****s I'm balling, balling, balling
Bad b*****s keep calling, wanna keep falling
I go mean I'm balling,
B***h I'm balling,
Sipping on that lean, I go hard my team
Pocks filled with that green, I just blew it all for my team
I'm balling, n***a I'm balling
I'm balling, n***a I'm balling
All of these many b*****s stunt
Cause I'm balling, I'm balling, I'm balling
I be counting these stacks,
Cracking cards get back, I gets me a b***h
Cause I'm balling, I'm balling, I'm balling
Truths off my a**, pocket filled of that cash
N****s see me they mad, b*****s see me they pass
I'm falling, now I keep talking cause I'm balling, I'm balling
Bad b*****s keep calling, wanna keep falling
I go mean I'm balling,
B***h I'm balling,
Sipping on that lean, I go hard my team
Pocks filled with that green, I just blew it all for my team
I'm balling, n***a I'm balling
I'm balling, n***a I'm balling.
