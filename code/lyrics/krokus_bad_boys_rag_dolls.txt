Song:

Just got outta high school, actin' like a jerk
Ain't got no money, ain't got no work
Scratchin' 'round for beaver
Scratchin' 'round for bread
No friends, no convictions
Man, it's like you're dead

Bad boys - rag dolls
Ain't gonna let you down
S** machines and rock 'n' roll queens
Turn the spotlight on

Pick up a guitar, kick out a sound
The music is hard and the music is loud
Got one helluva band, one helluva show
That's one thing you all should know

Bad boys - rag dolls
Ain't gonna let you down
S** machines and rock 'n' roll queens
Turn my body on
