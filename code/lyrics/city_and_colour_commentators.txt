Song:

I don’t wanna be revolutionary
I just took control to see this reality
If I overstayed my welcome
I will take my friends and leave
‘Cause I’m not trying to be revolutionary

What gave you the impression
That your opinion means anything to anyone?
What gave you the right
To bear arms against me… against us

You’re nothing but a bunch of amateurs
Commentators
Who live your lives
Hiding behind a wall of insecurities

I don’t wanna be revolutionary
I just took control to see this reality
If I overstayed my welcome
I will take my friends and leave
‘Cause I’m not trying to be revolutionary

Imagine it’s already broken
As you hold it in your hand
Think of all the work you’re doing
There’s work that you can only understand

Suppose it’s already faded
As it drains across your back
But even though you have this wonderful
Instead of everything that you love

[X2]
I don’t wanna be revolutionary
I just took control to see this reality
If I overstayed my welcome
I will take my friends and leave
‘Cause I’m not trying to be revolutionary
