Song:

When the sun set low in the blood red sky, yeah
Every house called out as we passed them by, yeah
She would grab my hand as the trees leaned in, yeah
Oh I'm still racing home from the place I've been

It was all I knew
I was waiting for the big one
And I stayed forever

Oh, oh, American secrets
I dreamed it was ours
That we just didn't know yet

We would drive out through every lonely street, yeah
Smell the truth in hear hair, felt the world at my feet, yeah
But we were just two kids in a beat-up car
Oh I'm still driving home from the things I've done

It was all I knew
I was waiting for the big one
And I stayed forever

Oh, oh, American secrets
I dreamed it was ours
That we just didn't know yet

Oh, oh, American secrets
I dreamed it was ours
That was lost in the regrets

We were caught on the inside
Left it all on that bedside

Give me one more minute with those baby blues
We pulled up

Oh, she looks back in ways as I wait too long
I can picture her room as the lights turn on
I'm still dancing alone with the way it was
I'm still dancing alone with the way it was

Give me one more, give me one more
Give me one more minute with my baby
(Oh, oh)
Give me one more, give me one more
Give me one more minute with American secrets
(Oh, oh)
Give me one more, give me one more

Oh she looks back in ways as she slips inside
Every hope in the world in those bright blue eyes
I'm still dancing alone with the way it was

Got my mind made up
And I'm coming back for you
I can hear your voice calling and I'll be there soon

I can see you there
In the bedroom by the stairs
Oh, I've always been running but I don't know where

And oh, and oh
It took twenty-five years but I finally see

Not the boy I was
In the car that you saw leave
But I'm still not the man that I thought I'd be

But when those trumpets sound
When the good Lord calls my name
Oh, I'm gonna be with you, oh I'm gonna be with you

And oh, and oh
It took twenty-five years but I finally see
And oh, and oh
It took twenty-five years but I finally see
It took twenty-five years but I finally see
It took twenty-five years but I think I see
