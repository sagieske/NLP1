Song:

Have you ever been in love? You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
you're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever walked on air?
Ever felt like you were dreaming?
When you never thought it could, but it really feels that good.
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
When your heart is shooting stars,
you're holding heaven in your arms.
Have you ever been in love?

The time I spent waiting for something that was heaven sent
when you find it, don't let go, I know.

Have you ever said a prayer?
And found that it was answered.
All my hope has been restored, I ain't looking anymore.
Have you ever been in love?
some place you ain't leavin...some place you gonna stay.
When you finally found the meaning. Have you ever felt this way?

The time I spent waiting for something that was heaven sent
when you find it, don't let go, I know.
Have you ever been in love?
You could touch the moonlight.
You can even reach the stars, doesn't matter how far.
Have you ever been in love?
Have you ever been in love?
So in love.
