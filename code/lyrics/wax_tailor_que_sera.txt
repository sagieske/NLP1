Song:

A record of the delightful piece they're going to play this evening
Ladies and gentlemen
Your attention please!
And now the moment we've been waiting for is here
I have something to tell you
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
The future's not our
I believe in the future
I don't believe in miracles
Can it be true: it must be true! No doubt!
Life is going on as normally as ever
But suddenly something seems to have happened
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction
People seem to be frightened, even terrified
I want everybody to understand this
I don't understand
I don't understand
There are a lot of things we don't understand, either
We need answers from you: what did you expect to find?
What's going to be our future?
It's your responsibility to do something about it
Well, I have the key in my hands: all I have to find is the lock
Now listen to me, all of you!
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
Oh you're divine!
