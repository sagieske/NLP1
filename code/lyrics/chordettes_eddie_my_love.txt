Song:

Eddie, my love, I love you so
Eddie, my love, I love you so

Eddie, my love, I love you so
How I've wanted for you
You'll never know

Please, Eddie
Don't make me wait to long
Oh, Eddie, Eddie, I love you so

Eddie, please write just one line
Tell me your love is still only mine
Please, Eddie, don't make me
Wait too long

You left me last September
Since that time I've been so alone
Now all I do is wish and wait for you
Eddie, since you've been gone

Eddie, my love, I'm sinking fast
The very next day might be my last
Please, Eddie, don't make me
Wait too long

Oh, Eddie, Eddie, I love you so
Eddie, my love
Oh, Eddie, Eddie, I love you so
Eddie, my love, I love you so
