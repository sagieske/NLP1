Song:

It was a sunday,
I never tought I could forget.
If I would remember'
I wouldn't be full of regret.

Now she needs an answer.
I forgot her Birthday.

Sitting and waiting,
I want her to know that I care.
No matter what I say,
I never make it up to her.

Now she needs an answer.
I forgot her Birthday.

After all we can be friends
Still pretend all the time.

After all we can be friends
Still pretend.

Because it was her birthday.
Because it was her birthday.
Because it was her birthday.
