Song:

She's looking good,
From head to toe
She's licking her paws
She's ready to go
Teeth like razors
And claws like knives,
She's ready to pounce on your a**
You know you won't survive!

She's got the eyes of a panther
She's got lips like Satan
She's got the eyes of a panther
And soon you'll be a matin'
She's got the eyes of a panther

She's making you crazy
Like a cat in heat
Got her claws running down your back
Wow under the sheets!
She's on the prowl meow!
Jaws ready to snap
Like a game of cat and mouse
You're caught in her trap!

She's got the eyes of a panther
And a tongue like a cow girl
She's got the eyes of a panther
You're gonna be her chow yeah!
She's got the eyes of a panther

She said
'Don't be afraid of heavy metal!
Don't be afraid to rock! To rock! To rock! '
She said don't be afraid now
So I won't...

You're hiding in the shadows
And you can hear her breath
Your heart's pounding like a bass drum
Boom Boom Boom
Ready to meet you death
She swats you down with a paw
She wants a meal, not a snack
She's onto bigger prey!

She's got the eyes of a panther
Yeah the cougar is a waitin'
She's got the eyes of a panther
There'll be no escaping
She's got the eyes of a panther

She got them eyes
She got them eyes
She got lies

She got teeth like razors
Eyes likes lasers
Ready to pounce
Your life is in danger
