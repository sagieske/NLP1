Song:

Turn from evil and do good
Turn from evil and do good
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Be thankful unto God
Da gracias a dios
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Give God praise everyday
Try to please him in every way
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

I woke up this morning feeling fine
With heaven on my mind
Cause I'm gonna be blessed by the Lord forever

Give him praise (8x)
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Turn from evil and do good
Turn from evil and do good
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Be thankful unto God
Da gracias a dios
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Give God praise everyday
Try to please him in every way
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

I woke up this morning feeling fine
With heaven on my mind
Cause I'm gonna be blessed by the Lord forever

Give him praise (8x)
And you will be blessed by the Lord forever

Blessed by the Lord forever (4x)
