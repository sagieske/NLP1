Song:

I want you to know how I feel about you
I must show
What to do everytime you are near
All the girls, who try and take your place
It's impossible
They don't matter
'Cause I'm inlove with you
'Cause you are

[Chorus:]

The love of my life
No one can make me feel the way you do
All my heart and soul I give to you
'Cause you are, the love of my life
Your smile can light the darkest part of me
Can you see
You are the love of my life
Ooohhh, yeah yeah

I searched for a long time
Just to find a love to call my own
Never thought that I can find someone like you
I promise you fidelity, in me you'll find security
Just say you'll stay with me always
There's no other way for me to say
You are

Bridge:

I can climb the highest mountain
With you beside me, mm yeah yeah
There's no one I would rather spend eternity, yeah
I know we've only been
Together for a short time, baby baby, baby
I want you to know, that I won't go
'Cause you are
