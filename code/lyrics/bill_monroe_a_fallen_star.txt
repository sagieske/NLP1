Song:

A star fell from heaven right into my arms
A brighter star I know I've never seen
Then I found out that it was only you with all your charms
Who came into my life to fill a dream
A fallen star is what you are
The twinkle in your eyes came from the sky
you must have strayed from the milky way
A fallen star that's what you are
The heavens must be lonely now that you are mine
I'm sure they'll miss a star as bright as you
But the stars will send there blessing and brighter they will shine
When they see the dream that's comin' true
