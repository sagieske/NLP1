Song:

Call you up when I know he's at home,
I jump out of my skin when he picks up the phone
Why can't I tell if he's looking at me?
Should I give him a smile?
Should I get up and leave?
I know it's strange, I don't what I'm thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to,
Cause I just can't get him out of mind and
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Bfb, bfb
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

I kinda think that I might be his type
Because if you're not around, he's not actin' too shy
Sometimes I feel like he might make a move
Is this all in my head?
I don't know what to do
I know it's strange, I don't know what he's thinking
But is it wrong if I see him this weekend
I really hope I can get him alone
I just don't, don't want her to know

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to,
Cause I just can't get him out of mind and
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Bfb, bfb
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
Bfb, bfb
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother

Cause he's such a dream
Yeah
And you know what I mean
If you weren't related

[Chorus:]
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Yeah Yeah Yeeeeaaah
A punk rock drummer and he's 6 foot 3
I don't want to, but I want to
Cause I just can't get him out of mind and
Yeah yeah Yeeeeaaah
My best friend's brother is the one for me
Bfb, bfb
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
Bfb, bfb
My best friend's brother, my best friend's brother
