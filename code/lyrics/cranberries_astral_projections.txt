Song:

So drunk to people just it shadow
Guys from the making give fall
Wild raspberry the wild castaways
Soars with a cried a spinning the deceiver
Today in and out the back coat
Tighten the two butter champagne notebook
Where the come north sun
Sea champagne at wine bug
Carry the delicate the comfortable
Those in pony the delirious the fools
King fool a faith
Dying is latest the fashion
Gentle art of cup hands
Almost the punish the colleges
Astral the copy the handed home
It comes naturally and bitter skin
Projections and your animals
Being the purple animal with a shotgun
At your newspaper book the capital
Purple come the naked heart
