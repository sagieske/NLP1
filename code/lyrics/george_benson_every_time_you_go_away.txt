Song:

Hey, if we can solve any problem
Why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same thing
Can't you see we got everything
Going on and on and on

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on saying the same thing
Just can't you see we got everything
Baby, even though you know

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

I can't go on saying the same thing
'Cause baby can't you see we got everything
Going on and on and on

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
Take away best of me, come on take away the rest of me

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
Take away best of me, come on take away the rest of me

Every time you go away
