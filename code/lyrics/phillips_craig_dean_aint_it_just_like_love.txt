Song:

[chorus]
Ain't it just like love
To catch a soul by a sweet surprise
Offer paradise
And make a heart it's home
Ain't it just like love
To always find the best in us
To give timeless trust
Like we've never known
Ain't it just like love
Just when you feel afraid
The future seems uncertain
And you've grown tired of searching
For truth along the way
[chorus]
Ain't it just like love
To catch a soul by a sweet surprise
Offer paradise
And make a heart it's home
Ain't it just like love
To always find the best in us
To give timeless trust
Like we've never known
Ain't it just like love
Just when you lost control
In one unguarded moment
Love takes a life that's broken
And one ?? makes it whole
[chorus]
Ain't it just like love
To catch a soul by a sweet surprise
Offer paradise
And make a heart it's home
Ain't it just like love
To always find the best in us
To give timeless trust
Like we've never known
Ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love, ain't it just like love, oh love
Like love yeah, ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love, ain't it just like God's love
Like love yeah, ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love, ain't it just like love
Like love yeah, ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love, ain't it just like God's love
[chorus]
Ain't it just like love
To catch a soul by a sweet surprise
Offer paradise
And make a heart it's home
Ain't it just like love
To always find the best in us
To give timeless trust
Like we've never known
Ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love
Offer paradise
And make a heart it's home
Ain't it just like love
To always find the best in us
To give timeless trust
Like we've never known
Ain't it just like love
Ain't it just like love
Just like love
