Song:

Chorus:
All God's creatures got a place in the choir,
Some sing low and some sing higher,
Some sing out loud on the telephone wire,
Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got, now
Repeat Chorus

Listen to the top where the little birds sing,
And the melodies and the high notes ringing,
And the hoot-owl cries over everything,
And the blackbird disagrees.

Singing in the night time singing in the day,
And the little duck quacks and he's on his way,
And the otter hasn't got much to say,
And the porcupine talks to himself.

Chorus 1x

Dogs and the cats they take up the middle,
Where the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
And the donkey brays and the pony neighs,
And the old gray badger sighs.

Listen to the bass it’s the one on the bottom,
Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus
Moans and groans with a big to-do,
And the old cow just goes moo.

Chorus

It’s a simple song a little song everywhere,
By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear,
The dopey alligator and the hawk above,
The sly old weasel and the turtledove.

Chorus 3x

All God's creatures got a place in the choir
