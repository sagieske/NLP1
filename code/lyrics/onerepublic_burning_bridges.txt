Song:

You and I were meant to be
Ain't no doubt about it
No need to hide that sort of thing
Now aim for something better
Ain't nothing better worth imagining

But I, I keep on running
I’m building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now on every single road that I could take, listen

[Chorus:]
I want you to burn my bridges down (down), I said
I want you to burn my bridges down (down, down)
Set me on Fire!
You set me
Set me on Fire!
You can burn my bridges down

Send this out to sea
Send it where you wanted
You can take your note for note and not at all
There’s no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
Imaginary faces, they don’t work at all

I, I keep on running
I’m building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now on every single road that I could take, listen

[Chorus:]
I want you to burn my bridges down (down), I said
I want you to burn my bridges down (down, down)
Set me on Fire!
You set me
Set me on Fire!
Will you burn my bridges down

I want you to burn my bridges down (down)
I want you to burn my bridges down, yeah

Set me on Fire!
You set me
Set me on Fire!
Set me on fire
I want you to burn my bridges down (down), I said
I want you to burn my bridges down (down, down)
Set me on fire
Set me on fire
