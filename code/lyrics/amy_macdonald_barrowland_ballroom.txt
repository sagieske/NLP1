Song:

Oh the lights outside they're as bright as the sun
They're much brighter than anyone
Oh the girls in the queue yes they're waiting for you
Well they're waiting for their song to be sung

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away it's not the same
Tell me who's to blame
And when the stars shine so bright on a cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me through the barrowland, our history, and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And they'll drink and dance and drugs you know it's all part of the show
We're going to maybe have to tell you
The people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

Oh nothing beats the feeling of the high Barrowland ceiling
When the band starts to play
Won't you buy me a drink and I'll tell her what I think
If she gets in my way

And when the night turns to day and all the people go away it's not the same
Tell me who's to blame
And when the stars shine so bright on a cold December night
I wish that I was on the stage

Oh won't you take a ride with me through the barrowland, our history, and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you
And they'll drink and dance and drugs you know it's all part of the show
Were going to to maybe have to tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you

And when the night turns to day and the lights they fade away
(I wish that life and love would pass me by)
And when the band stops a song because there's something going on
(Well there is magic in the air I swear)
And I wish that I saw Bowie playing on that stage
I wish that I saw something to make me come of age

Oh won't you take a ride with me through the barrowland, our history, and I'll sing you a song or two
People they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
It's only me and you, and knew
And they'll drink and dance and drugs you know it's all part of the show
We're going to maybe have to tell you
That people they may stop and stare but baby I just don't care
Tonight, it's only me and you
