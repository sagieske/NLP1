Song:

All I've got is a picture of you
Now that you've gone and left me blue
You don't hear me cry at night
And say sweet things to you
You don't hear me sing a love song to
A picture of you

I pretend that you're still here with me
Laughing just the way we used to be
But pictures they can't talk and they can't see
I know I'm in love and nothing more
Nothing more

I hope you'll be happy where you are
But if you need me I won't be to far
Standing in the shadow of my dreams
They say it's not as bad as it may seem
But they don't lie awake at night and cry the way I do
They don't realise that all I got
Is a picture of you
