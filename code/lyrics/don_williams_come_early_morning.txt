Song:

I been walking, walking in the moonlight
Tripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down
Walking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road
Come early morning I'll be there on the edge of town

I was a thinking, thinking 'bout a good thing
Thinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes
And I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side

Chorus:
I have drifted up across the mountain
And I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied

She give me little loving, gives me little sunshine
Makes me have a good time, Lord when I'm feeling' blue
I couldn't refuse her, well I couldn't misuse her
Come early morning I'll be home with my honey dew
