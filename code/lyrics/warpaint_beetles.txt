Song:

Aeeeh
I'm not prepared, I just gotta gotta get there
Where am I, why can't I just get it together?
F**k it, where's my s**t?
Oh my God I'm mad at it
Oh my God I'm mad at it

Oh my God I'm mad at it
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the window
I wanna throw it out the door

And here I go and blame it on
That thing and that thing
And the other thing and that thing
Oh no

Let's get naked and rip down the wall that makes me crazy,
Tell me how
Someone hold my hand and give me lessons cause I wanna
Melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot

I'll never stay, love is the only way up
I... Oh-ohh
I know when I see you
I'm lucky, wait here for silence to come and
Take me down
To see, what do I wait here for?
What do I need to decide?
So slow
Heart heart beat beat
I know that you want to, I know that you want to
Just tell them
Where your heart is
Heart beat love
I wait for tonight
Save this life
Braving through fire

... I am not prepared, I just gotta gotta get there,
Where am I, why can't I just get it together?
F**k it, where's my s**t?
Oh my God I'm mad at it
Oh my God I'm mad at it
I wanna throw it out the window
Let's get naked and rip down the wall that makes me crazy
Tell me how
Someone hold my hand and give me lessons cause I wanna
Melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
I wanna melt the knot inside of it
Someone hold my hand and give me lessons cause I wanna... ï»¿
