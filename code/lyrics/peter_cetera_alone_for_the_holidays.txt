Song:

She said she always loved this time of year
And how used to celebrate when he was here
Then he went away - nothing more to say
He's not coming home
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She wrote down every word in her diary
She reads it now and then
To remind her of how it used to be
He's not here today - there's nothing more to say
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She cries all night on Christmas Eve
She just gets by on Christmas day
She's lost her will but kept her faith
But he's not coming home
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She cries all night on New Year's Eve
She just gets by on New Year's Day
She's lost her will but kept her faith
He's never coming home
Alone for the holidays
