Song:

If I hold my breath too long, would I feel you closer to me?
If I'm not that scared anymore, would you hold me,
And tell me things like never before?

If I could find a failure in light,
How could I, save myself from you?
If I could smile with tears in my eyes
I've picked each leaf that you've left behind.

Taking on today, the hardest thing to say
I wish to have you sooner
I've waited for this day, now I could tell you
And show you things that make you feel sure.

If I could find a failure in light,
How could I, save myself from you
If I could smile with tears in my eyes
I've picked each leaf that you've left behind.

If I could find a failure in light,
How could I, save myself from you
If I could smile with tears in my eyes
I've picked each leaf that you've left behind.

If I could find a failure in light,
How could I, save myself from you
If I could smile with tears in my eyes
I've picked each leaf that you've left behind.

If I hold my breath too long
Would I feel you closer?
