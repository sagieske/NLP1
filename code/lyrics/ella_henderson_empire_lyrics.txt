Song:

They don't laugh ever

I see your lie
I know it's coming and I'm terrified
No more defences here to hide behind
Oh, just you and I
And through the smoke, I see you're burning like a ray of hope
I found the fire and now the ashes glow
Oh, come alive
And now that I'm awake
I'm not afraid, I'm letting go tonight

Cause we found strength
And enjoyed the songs
We built this life and we made it up
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, they will enjoy these cards
We'll build on life and we'll make it up
Empire, empire, empire

Stone by stone, we build this hour we call our own
So high the world forget the world below
Oh, just you and I, high
So let the drums roll
The cannons blow, we're letting go tonight

Cause we found strength
And enjoyed the songs
We built this life and we made it up
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, they will enjoy these cards
We'll build on life and we'll make it up
Empire, empire, empire

They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire
They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire

Cause we found strength
And enjoyed the songs
We built this life and we made it up
Empire, empire, empire
And you and I, they will enjoy these cards
We'll build on life and we'll make it up
Empire, empire, empire

They'll never take it down, take it down
Burn it down, burn us down
Take it down, take down our empire
