Song:

Never been to England, never been to France
never really learned how to dance
I've never taken dope and I've never taken drugs
ah, I've never danced on a bear-skin rug

Guess it's true, what all those people they say
I'm gonna have to loose my hometown ways
Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life

Never went around with anything
I've had a hometown life, and I have never learned to swing
Not much of a life, I haven't seen much
I've been true to my wife and it's just been too much

Guess it's true, what all these people they say
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
You know it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life

Guess it's true, what all those people they say
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life
