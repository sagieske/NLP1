Song:

We tried to be vague
But some of us may eat
At least I hold the other in the right light
This guy's gonna break
Some of us die heroes
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always see

You should, I could go anywhere
You could go anywhere
...
I could go anywhere
... Knows...
Shines so brightly
Seems like...

You tried to be vague
Summing up by piece
At least I had my taste of the right life
You tried to replace something you might need
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always speak

You should, I could go anywhere
You could go anywhere
...
I could go anywhere
... Knows...
Shines so brightly
No I'm not there
Seems like no one's coming our way
... Part to play
Seems like no one's coming our way
The other side
I could go anywhere
...
I could go anywhere
