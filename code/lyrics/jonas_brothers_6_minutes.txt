Song:

She's the kinda girl that you see in the movies
Seen her in my dreams and now she's standing next to me
Down by the shore first weekend of the summer
Gotta take chance and just ask for her number
I wish I had a song on mtv
Cause in crowded room I'd be the only one she sees
She's looking bored and now I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's were I wanna be
Another minute everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

She's looking at her watch while the dj is spinning
This could be the end or it's just the beginning
She's the kinda girl that I wanna know better
Reaching for her keys so I guess it's now or never
I wish that I was on the radio
I'd sing her favorite song she'd be front row at every show
This party's lame and now I'm running out of time
I've only got six minutes if I'm gonna make her mine

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's were I wanna be
Another minute everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes

Sometimes I feel like the catcher in the rye
Sometimes I wish that I could catch her eye
Sometimes I wish that I could be that guy, yeah
Time is passing by
I'm losing my mind
I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 minutes with you

One minute and the earth begins to shake
Two minutes and my hearts begins to break
Another minute and she makes me feel brand new
That's just three minutes with you
Four minutes and she's everything I see
Five minutes and she's were I wanna be
Another minute everything just feels so new
I need six minutes with you
Six minutes
