Song:

Hello, my friends
Here we are again
I'll promise I'll be swift
And let it end
'Cause that is a part where I can see
(That you still really love me)

After all your love is gone
Would you burn another book?
Would you tear apart
The pages of our lives?
After all your love is gone
Will I be pushing and pulling
And freaking and fighting?
And whoa, whoa

You don't even like me
You probably hate me
You know I'm a trainwreck
But I can't understand
Or listen to your demands
'Cause I'll suck it up
Just like you always told me to.

After all your love is gone
Would you burn another book?
Would you tear apart
The pages of our lives?
After all your love is gone
Will I be pushing and pulling
And freaking and fighting?
And whoa, whoa

Lasting days of memory
All the lasting pain and tragedy
Of our lives, our lives
Trust in me almost every time
That the love we share
Baby, you and I
Is it love?
Then what is?
If it's love, then you won't leave me
I said you won't deny me

Baby, come back here
When your love's true
Baby, come back here
When your love's true
Baby, come back here
Are you mine?

After all your love is gone
Would you tear
Would you tear apart
The world with all our lives?

Come back here
When your love's true
Baby, come back here
When you want me to
Spend all of my love
And time on you
