Song:

Don't go moping around.
What you need's a little bit of luck and a lot a bit of show from your friends.
You know how that goes and before you know what's up
We'll have found something way better to mope about.
So how about we hang out a little more than we should.
And I wouldn't worry much about much.
When the drama goes down then just basics are ok.
I'd rather see a smile on display. It's so great... It's so great... (so great)
So how about we hang out a little more than we should.
And I wouldn't worry much about much.
So how about we hang out a little more than we should.
(so how about we hang out a little more than we should)
And I wouldn't worry much about much. (and I wouldn't worry much about much) (so how about)
