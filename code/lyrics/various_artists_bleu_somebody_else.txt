Song:

What if I was alright
What if I wasn't wound so tight
What if I had the balls to be bad
Would you still look at me like that
Would you be mad that I had held the old me back

Why can't I be somebody else
Somebody who isn't too cool to believe it's ok to be just me

Maybe I was too much
Maybe I'll take it down at notch
Maybe I have the guts to go mad
Maybe I mess me up real bad
Maybe I'll make you wish you had the old me back

Why can't I be somebody else
Somebody who isn't too cool to believe it's ok to be just me

What if I can't remember who Im tryin to be
Why can't I be somebody else
Somebody who isn't too cool to believe it's ok to be just me
Just me...
