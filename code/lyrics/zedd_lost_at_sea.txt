Song:

[Verse:]
I was a boat drifting out into the sea
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope
That you would see me

I was a stone's throw away from land
But thousands and thousands of miles away
From reaching your hand

[Bridge:]
The waves they crashed upon the rocks that you
Were Trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me
The waves that crashed upon the rocks that you
Were trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

[Hook:]
Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Yeah

[Bridge:]
The waves they crashed upon the rocks that you
Were Trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me
The waves that crashed upon the rocks that you
Were trying to walk along
And in my head I heard them play a song for you and me

[Hook:]
Let's get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Get lost at sea
Where they will never find us
Got stars at night to guide us
Yeah
