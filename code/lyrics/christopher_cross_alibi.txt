Song:

It's a calm wind blowing on my skin
And I've been dreaming again
Now that we're all here
We can share these notes and all this madness
We can talk of innocence
And of all the things we believe in

Is it an alibi
Is it the reason why
Is it the way we really feel inside
Set it free


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere


Daybreak
In a place I've known before
Will I find me behind that final door


I can hear the footsteps of the past
I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast
I'm gonna spend some time with the moon
Pour myself a glass of midnight
Keep myself in tune


Is it an alibi
Is it the tears I cry
Is it the way I see it through your eyes


The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere
