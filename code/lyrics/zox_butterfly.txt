Song:

I tried little butterfly not to hurt you
So i guess that this might come as some surprise
I'm gonna take this trian even though i never thought i'd desert you
I've got a ticket and i'm just biding my time

I don't really want to work it out
And i can only wonder what you're all about

I tired little butterfly to protect you
It was asking for disaster but i guess that's just the way it goes
If it's anything know that i will never forget you
Today it hurts but tommorow it won't even know

I don't really want to work it out
Because i can only wonder what you're all about
We talk and talk it's all my fault and still i know it's true
That i don't know much but i know i don't need you
And everything's a little better without you
