Song:

This man you love, this boy you hate
The hills are his in all embrace
Enchanted and not soon lost
This man you call with lover's draw
So coarse in kind it can't be sought
For leaving is what I do

I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith

Ever wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
There's no one here to care
Someone always thought a good reason, baby
Just why we're really here
Affirm my power to spend my dollars, to get us home, yeah
I've got no money, got no secrets

Maybe we were born to kiss another
Maybe we were born to run forever
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever
Kiss me alone

This boy you chance, this man you'll find
Will dry the tears behind your eyes
So stop laughing and play the muse
This heartache rots that which spills
From my heart into your will
So give in to the rivers wind

I declare myself
Declare myself of faith
I declare myself
Declare myself of faith

Every wonder why they kill the weak ones, baby
So they can to testify
For every single ghost on that freeway, baby
Has got to give a mild holler to spend my dollars
We've got to get away
I've got no money, got no secrets

Maybe we were born to love each other
Maybe we were born to run forever
Or maybe we were born to come together, or whatever

Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone

Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love each other

Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone
Kiss me alone

Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love
Maybe we were born to love each other
Kiss me alone
