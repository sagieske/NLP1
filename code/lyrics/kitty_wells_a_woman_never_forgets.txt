Song:

Tie a string around your finger leave a note upon your desk
Don't forget little things that happened to bring you happiness
It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor just remember the one you adore
So hold her and tell her you love her if you're the man that remembers her.

A woman never forgets all the little things you do
A woman never forgets all the mem'ries you bring her
It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor just remember the one you adore
So hold her and tell her you love her if you're the man that remembers her.

A woman never forgets all the little things you do
A woman never forgets all the mem'ries you bring her
It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor just remember the one you adore
So hold her and tell her you love her if you're the man that remembers her.

So hold her and tell her you love her if you're the man that remembers her...
