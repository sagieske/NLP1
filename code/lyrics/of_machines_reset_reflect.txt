Song:

I'm in too deep to know that I'm not alone
This is not my escape.
So many times before we'd go along
These words are weakening
I won't look back on these feelings I can't ignore
(We'd go along)

My presence stays but the truth remains
A reflection of what I used to see
A chance to separate the lines
Dear god, 
Can't you see my hands reaching out?
Take me! 
I'm barely breathing now
This is what I've been searching for all along
This light grows faint as I persist
With no direction to go
To keep me alive
To keep me alive

I'm in too deep to know that I'm not alone
This is not my escape.
So many times before we'd go along
These words are weakening
I won't look back on these feelings I can't ignore
(We'd go along)

And now I find myself so indifferent
We have no attachments
No attachments

No
No
Well, 
Does it phase me?
No
We need to find my way home
I find it in your eyes

Just one more night
Just one more night
We have to keep this moving
Keep this moving
Just one more night
Just one more night
To find my own way home
My own way home
To find my way
