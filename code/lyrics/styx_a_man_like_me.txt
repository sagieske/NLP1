Yeah

Eight days a week with my baby at home
And you know that she's my tender honey

Baby I've been good
But you know it's rough
When you're spending all of my money

Ain't no disputin' I'm your man
You know I want to tell the world

You're the only woman
Show me what love can be
You're the only woman
That understands a man like me

Rock and roll is a way of life
But don't you know it brings me down
Music is my game but when I'm home
I treat a lady like she's wearing a crown

Stranded in the storm 'round lakewood way
You know who comes to mind

She's the only woman
Show me what love can be
She's the only woman
That understands a man like me

[guitar solo]

When I'm away with time to kill
Just sittin' around gettin' high
Thinking about your sweet sweet love
I wanna jump on a plane and fly

Sweet little susie
Show me what love can be
She's the only woman
That understands a man
She understands a man
(like me)

She's the only woman
She's the only woman
She's the only woman
