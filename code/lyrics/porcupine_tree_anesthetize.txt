Song:

A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with fear

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up, be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul makes me feel awake in my legs
My head in the clouds and I'm zoning out
I'm watching tv but I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored but I can't switch off

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only mtv, cult philosophy

We're lost in the mall shuffling through the stores like zombies
Well what is the point, what can money buy
My hands on a gun and I find the range, God tempts me
Well what did you say; think I'm passing out

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only mtv, cult philosophy

Only apathy from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only mtv, cult philosophy

Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
I smiled into the sun

Water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed the short life
As they broke on the shore line
I could see you, but I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen...
There's black across the sun

Water so warm on that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
I smiled into the sun
