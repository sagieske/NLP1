Song:

Kiss the sand, praising a dry land he has found
Everywhere on shore there's treasure all around
Bury deep the horded loot far down below
No man or god will ever take away your plunder

He will find a cave to hide away the gold
Doomed to a desert isle
All of the riches in his hands
No living thing around
But he will never leave the cave
Alone with bounty gold
Something compels him to stay
Heaven or Hell, time will tell

The captain thinks what will come of this
If this is the end, the gold must die with me
Delving underground, to his dismay
The captain finds a curse

The isle of eternal despair, spend eternity alone
The isle of eternal despair, with gold beyond his dreams

What a sight that's sitting right before his eyes
Ancient spoils of the pirates of the past
Skeletons are sheathed in gold by candlelight
Hunger sets but he will guard the jewels forever

Now he's punished by the gods
Forever pondering his greed
But he's doomed to eternal life
As a golden skeleton

The isle of eternal despair, doomed as his flesh beings to rot
The isle of eternal despair, knowing he'll never really die

As he decays into living, golden bones
Eyes open watching for the rest of his life
