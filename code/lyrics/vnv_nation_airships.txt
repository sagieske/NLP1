Song:

I pressed my face against the glass,
Smiled as my breath made some pattern or other
The world beneath unfurled before me like a sail,
Glinted in gold from this rich dawn sky
Awaiting the ship they had told me would come,
Quietly anticipating that which was to come
I couldn't yet see you. Still obscured by the city
A towers of glass reflected your coming
Silhouetted on the sunrise
Did I blink as I watched? Did I close my eyes?
I was not alone, I think it was the first time
Watching you rise splendid and graceful,
I cheered as you sailed, a greatness unknown
I laughed as I waved and imagined you saw me
In the streets of the city, the windows of buildings,
A million faces gazing upwards in wonder
A million faces together and cheering and smiling
You were the warmth of their hearts, you were the sum of their dreams
In the coldness of morning you brought warmth to their lives
Giving this feeling of wonder I could not imagine
You unlocking these thoughts no book and no picture could ever convey
This feeling and morning had opened a door.
I stepped into a new world I watched you fly
Saw you as a friend, the spirit of dreams
I imagined a new world, lands far away,
Imagined those faces as you hung in their sky
I'm leaving ground stepping into a new world.
I'm leaving ground, a new world. And watching you fly
I stepped into, I stepped into a new world
I was not alone, I think it was the first time
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
Now I'm leaving home, leaving everything
I step into this new world leaving everything
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
I'm leaving ground, stepping into a new world
Now I'm leaving home, leaving everything that I have ever known
I step into this new world leaving everything
Leaving everything, leaving everything.
