Song:

Can you smell sarcasm
On my breath??
I'm a new age puppet strung
Out on death

A rat like me won't
Save the world
A freak like me
A rat like me won't
Save the world
Going down and killin' time
Down down down
I do the dance of the cursed
Everyday
There's nobody worse
Nowhere no way

A rat like me won't
Save the world
A shit like me
A rat like me won't
Save the world
Going down one step away
Down down down

Everybody's bangin'
On this landmine
Everybody's sippin'
On their pain
I am not alone in my head here
But I'll gladly take the blame

I'm a snot nosed
Nuclear punk
A rat like me won't
Save the world
A man like me
A dog like me won't save
A worm like me won't save
A rat like me won't
Save the world
Going down and killin' time
Down down down

Rat dog worm freak
