Song:

Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight

[CHORUS]
Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
I can get dizzy
Just looking above
You are as far
As my faraway love

Faraway love, faraway love
Who can be happy
With faraway love

Wish that I may
Wish that I might
Grant me the wish
That I'm wishing tonight

[Repeat CHORUS]

Once must he seem
Distant from me
Even when we are
As close as can be

Powerful star
Wonderfully wise
Let me be seen
By his faraway eyes

When I am near
When I am near
Couldn't he be more
Aware that I'm here

We're holding hands
Inches apart
Show me the way
To his faraway heart

[Repeat CHORUS]

Faraway, faraway
Faraway star
How did you ever
Get up where you are
