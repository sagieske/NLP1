Song:

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth,
My two front teeth,
See my two front teeth!

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth,
Then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas."
It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
If I could only whistle.

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth,
My two front teeth,
See my two front teeth.

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth,
Then I could wish you
"Merry Christmas!"

It seems so long since I could say,
"Sister Susie sitting on a thistle!"
Gosh oh gee, how happy I'd be,
If I could only whistle (thhhh, thhhh)

All I want for Christmas
Is my two front teeth,
My two front teeth,
See my two front teeth.

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth,
Then I could wish you
"Merry Chris, Chris, Chris, a Happy New Year!"
