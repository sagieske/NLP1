Song:

Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh

Life's a tangled web of cellphone calls and hashtag I-don't-knows
And you, you're so caught up in all the blinking lights and dial tones
I admit I'm a bit of a victim in the worldwide system too
But I find my sweet escape when I'm alone with you

Tune out the static sound of the city that never sleeps
Here in the moment on the dark side of the screen

I like the summer rain
I like the sounds you make
We put the world away
We get so disconnected
You are my getaway
You are my favourite place
We put the world away
Yeah weâ€™re so disconnected

Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh
Weâ€™re so disconnected
Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh

Hands around my waist
You're counting up the hills across the sheets
And I'm a falling star, a glimmer lighting up these cotton streets
Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™m a bit of a fool for playing by their rules
But I find my sweet escape when Iâ€™m alone with you

Tune out the static sound of the city that never sleeps
Here in the moment on the dark side of the screen

I like the summer rain
I like the sounds you make
We put the world away
We get so disconnected
You are my getaway
You are my favourite place
We put the world away
Yeah we're so disconnected

Turn off the radio
Those late night tv shows
Hang up the telephone
And just be here with me

Turn off the radio
Those late night tv shows
Hang up the telephone
And just be here with me

I like the summer rain
I like the sounds you make
We put the world away
We get so disconnected
You are my getaway
You are my favourite place
We put the world away
Yeah we're so disconnected

I like summer rain
I like the sounds you make
We put the world away
We get so disconnected
You are my getaway
You are my favourite place
We put the world away
Yeah we're so disconnected

Oh oh o-oh oh oh o-oh oh [x4]
