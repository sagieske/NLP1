Song:

(Arthur Smith)

Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I love you long with a faithful heart
But never anymore can I believe you

I seen the time I'd a married you
And been your constant lover
But now I'd gladly give you up
For one whose heart is truer

You think you are too good for me
You think I am forsaken
But if you think I care for you
You are very much mistaken

My mind is like the constant sun
From the east to the west it ranges
But yours is like unto the moon
It's every month it changes

When I lay down to take my rest
No scornful one to wake me
I'll go straightway unto my grave
Just as fast as time can take me

Adieu false heart now we must part
May the joys of the world go with you
I love you long with a faithful heart
But never anymore can I believe you
