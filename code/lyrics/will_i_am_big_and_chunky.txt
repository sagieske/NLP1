Song:

Chunky, chunky,
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round
With something, something
They Like my sound
They think I'm funky

My name is Motto Motto
You say it double
Say my name
Motto Motto
Say it again
Motto Motto
I am nice and smooth
So nice and sassy

No other Hippos
Don't wanna get next to me
I like em chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
I like em hippos
That's in the wild
I like they attitude
I like they style
The way they walk, walk
The way they talk, talk
I like 'em witta appetite
To eat a shark, shark
And when a dog barks, she'll eat em too

I love every inch,
Oh yes I do
I like em chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy
Chunky, chunky, chunky
Plumpy, plumpy, plumpy

Ain't nottin' wrong
With lovin' chunky
I like 'em funny
I like 'em spunky
I like 'em witty
I like 'em smart... With brains
Girl I Like your big...
What you say
Your big ol' heart

Girl you crazy
She drive me crazy
I love my lady
She nice and shapely
She nice and spacey
Take so much space up
Like a big ol' spaceship
Movin' so gracious
Yes
It's all in the way she moves
It's all in the way she moves
It's all in the way
It's all in the way she moves
When she do, what she do
What she do, what she do, what she do, what she do
Get it girl
Chunky
Plumpy
Chunky
Plumpy
Ain't nottin' wrong
Ain't nottin' wrong
Chunky
