Song:

My heart pumps this Blood rushtill my legs numb
My sweat drips down my face
Clears my vison I battle myself
I battle
Keep my hands from my troat
For this sinlence
Ibattle my self Swollow down now
Whole
Bitter Pill unfolds
I lose my surroundings and fake that
I've gianed hope
This Bitter Pill he Swollows takes the tension
He's lost control of his hands control of steps
Somewhere he fears
Was almost sure could never happen to him
When this Pill is dessolved in his suffering body
He'll lay there stiff and shamfully
Guilty acts laced with fear lie the knots to be
Temporarily secure
Guilty acts laced with fear lie the knots to be lost in his lies...
