Intro:

You got to be yourself
And no one else
Yes you got to be yourself

Every man got intention
And every man got his own potential
A cool head is essential
Cause babylon will put on a sentece
You got what it takes
Inside, that's where your true self abides
Put on your brakes
Never hide, why you always living outside

Chorus 1:

A no time deh
Fi go join dem
Jah rastafari say fi seek and you shall find then
No time deh
Fi we go join dem
You follow babylon you end up ina problem

Well nuff a dem out deh sell dem soul because of vanity
Me see dem a search but can not find fi dem identity
Cause their identity is coming from the nozzle of dem gun
But I and I identity is coming from the nyabingi drum

Chorus 2:

If a who you are
You think seh dad nuh good enough
Then you find the life seh outta road it well rough
And if a what you are
You think deh dad nuh good enough
Member fi go meditate in god you hafi trust

Left the devil works man a nuh you fi dad
Six foot under ground fi all who want to go pennie that
Tears I cry fi da one ya who want follow that
Children of the almighty god dem a no idiot

Chorus 1

In this world full of fake and fraud
Got to deh pon your toes
You can't drop your guard
And if you ever let dem ina your yard
You hafi bawl out oh lord

Seh the time gets ruggy and the going gets steep
As you stand up as a soldier man you can't get weak
Your duty is to provide for the week
We trodding down Selassie-I-Street

Never get a weak when you back against the wall
You know seh kingdom rise and you know seh kingdom fall
Member how we push down the Jericho Wall
Listen to Jah words no badda sit down and a stall

Chorus 1
