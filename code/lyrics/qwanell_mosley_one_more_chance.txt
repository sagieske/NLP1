I just wannna let you know I really do care for you [x3]
Holla at me anytime shorty I'll be here for you

Hey yo ma I cried for you and if you finna get hit
I'll jump in front of the slug and die for you
Cause I love you and I wouldn't wanna see you go
I ain't tryin to keep it on the low I don't care who knows
That you're my favorite lady it's crazy
Cause I'm nothin without you baby
Lately I've been feelin like I'm in love
Cause it feels good everytime you give me a hug
I know I said some things to you that you didn't deserve
And I wish that I could take back all of them mean words
But I can't so I apologize now I'm a be the guy that'll keep you satisfied
I never thought that I would one day settle down
But I opened up my eyes and realized what I found
I just wanna let you know I really do care for you
Holla at me anytime shorty Scan here for you

Girl I know I hurt you in the past
And I treated you so bad
But if you give me one more chance baby
(I promise to make things right)
[X2]

Hey yo I'm done with them other females all I want is you
Cause you're the one for me and baby I'm the one for you
Sometimes we may fuss and fight
But I can never see you not being part of my life
Cause you bought out the better man in me
We got real close cause you really understandin me
The bond that we share together is too strong
Cause we've been together too long
To let what we have just slip away
That's why I get on my knees everyday and pray
But I know we're gonna be okay
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make things right
Girl, even if it takes me my whole life
You're everything I need you're my heart, you're my soul
I'm a never let you go cause you're worth more than gold
I just wanna let you know I really do care for you
Holla at me anytime shorty Scan here for you

Girl I know I hurt you in the past
And I treated you so bad
But if you give me one more chance baby
(I promise to make things right)
[X2]

You got me feelin worthless, you know you my purpose
Give me one more chance ma you know I deserve it
Just because I st-studder th-that don't mean I'm nervous
(Just because I st-studder th-that don't mean I'm nervous)
I'm just tryin to say that I wanna make it better
Instead of me being the one you say that you regret it
I just wanna let you know I really do care for you
Holla at me anytime shorty Black here for you

Girl I know I hurt you in the past
And I treated you so bad
But if you give me one more chance baby
(I promise to make things right)
[X4]

I just wanna let you know I really do care for you [x3]
Holla at me anytime shorty I'll there for you

I'm so sorry for all I've done
I just need one more chance
