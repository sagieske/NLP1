Song:

I see it in your eyes that I've been played right out
I see through your disguise I see what about
Why don't you come right out and say
That you'll be leaving any day
Take it from me I don't have to buy my love
I can get it free why don't you try my love
If you could stand inside my shoes
Then you would see what I stand to lose.
Why do you here to pretend
When deep inside you know it's the end.
Star studded sham gold plated cheat diamond studded fake
Star studded sham gold plated cheat diamond studded fake
If you don't really wanna love me then let me go
If you don't really wanna love me then let me go
Take it from me I don't have to buy my love
I can get it free why don't you try my love
You cheatin' lies are out of date
Come take my love don't make me wait.
If you really love me you'd let me know
But if you don't then let me go.
