Song:

Because of Jesus, I have peace of mind
Because of Jesus, I'm no longer blind
Because of Jesus, old things have passed away
Because of Jesus, you can start again today

Still I don't understand His love, the love He has for me
I just know one simple fact, He died to set me free
When I see that I have fallen, I just go to Him
Because Jesus is the only one who can take away my sin

Because of Jesus, I have peace of mind
Because of Jesus, I'm no longer blind
Because of Jesus, old things have passed away
Because of Jesus, you can start again today

There were times I thought that He had left me on my own
I have learned how much He loves me and now, now I know
That I am like a jewel to Him and He watches over me
And He is so concerned about me that He will never leave

Because of Jesus, my old life is gone
Because of Jesus, instead of bein' weak, I'm strong
Because of Jesus, all things have been made new
