Song:

For I dug a mass grave in abysmal depths
For this wasted human race shall never be reborn again

Cold burial, their blood stains the snow
Eyes that will never see the same again, 
After I've shattered your mirrors forever
I will not be kind in the torture you desire
Walking through genocidal remnants
With a hate filled heart
Stabbing even at the tears of withering corpses
Will there even be a word known as death anymore, 
When left is nothing to kill?
