Song:

Ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothin' like the real thing, no, no
Ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby (Ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin' like the real thing
Ooh, I've got your picture hangin' on my wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name (When I call your name)
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me and they don't groove me
Like when I hear (When I'm in your arms)
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear (In my ear)
No other sound
Is quite the same as your name (Quite the same as your name)
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together
Ooh, I've got memories (Memories) to look back on
Though they help when you're gone
I'm well aware (I'm well aware)
Nothin' can take the place of you being there (Being there)
Ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby (Ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin' like the real thing, ooh baby
Ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby (Ain't nothin')
Ain't nothin' like the real thing
