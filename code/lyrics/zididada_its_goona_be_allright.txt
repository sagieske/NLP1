IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT

(verse)

Every now and then, I get this feelin' girl, you have a doubt within your heart how can I convince you? I'm not leavin' you know I loved you from the very start

(bridge)

Every morning when I see, that you're lying next to me uuuuuuuhh I'm in love!! you don't have to be afraid, let me tell it to you straight I'm here for you

(chorus)

It's gonna be allright, it's gonna be A - OK I'm gonna stay by your side, girl you make my day it's gonna be allright, don't worry 'bout me I'm gonna stay by your side, I'm as happy as can be it's gonna be allright, girl you make day

(verse)

Hopefully one day you will believe me you're the only one on my mind everytime we kiss you make me dizzy girl, you are my favourite waste off time

(bridge)

(chorus)


Girl, I'll never let you be, lonely without me I'm gonna stay forever you are my destiny, the only one for me can't you see

(chorus.....outro)
