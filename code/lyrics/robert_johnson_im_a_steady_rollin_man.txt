Song:

I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
But I haven't got no sweet woman, boys, to be rollin' this way

I'm the man that rolls when icicle's hangin' on the tree
I'm the man that rolls when icicle's hangin' on the tree
And now you hear me howlin', baby, down on my bended knee

I'm a hard workin' man, have been for many years, I know
I'm a hard workin' man, have been for many long years, I know
And some cream puff's usin' my money
Ooh, babe but that'll never be no more

You can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time
Ooh ooh, you can't give your sweet woman
Everything she wants in one time
Well, boys, she get ramblin' in her brain
Some monkey man on her mind

I'm a steady rollin' man, I roll both night and day
I'm a steady rollin' man and I roll both night and day
Well, I don't have no sweet woman, boys, to be rollin' this way
