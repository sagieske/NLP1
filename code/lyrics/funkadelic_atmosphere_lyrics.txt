Song:

Good evening, boys and girls
Welcome to another evening of
"I hate that word called dick"
It goes like this:
I hate that word called "dick"
It sounds so awfully thick
So I think I'll call it "prick"
'Cause I hate that word called "dick".
Ha ha ha ha!
I hate that word called "pussy"
It sounds so awful squishy
So I guess I'll call it "clit"
'Cause I hate that word called "pussy".
Ha ha ha ha!
