Song:

Everybody's gatherin round that Christmas tree
We're laughin and talkin and singin so merrily
There's pumpkin pie and toys, happy girls and boys,
But what's the proper meaning, behind this Christmas joy?
Oh celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
It's the birthday of the One, who makes to blind to see
He purchased my salvation, way back on Calvary
I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
Celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
It's the birthday of the One, who makes to blind to see
He purchased my salvation, way back on Calvary
I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
Everybody's gatherin round that Christmas tree
We're laughin and talkin and singin so merrily
There's snow flakes on the ground, loved ones all around
But Christmas lights won't shine as bright, as all this joy I've found
Celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
It's the birthday of the One, who makes to blind to see
He purchased my salvation, way back on Calvary
I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
People celebrate the Spirit, Christmas brings to town
It's nothing new to Christians, cause we feel it all year round
All year round, we feel it all year round
Everybody's gatherin round that Christmas tree
We're laughin and talkin and singin so merrily
There's presents round the tree, one for you and me
But the greatest gift of all, is still a soul set free!
Celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
It's the birthday of the One, who makes to blind to see
He purchased my salvation, way back on Calvary
I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
You know I'm celebrating Jesus, that's what Christmas means to me
