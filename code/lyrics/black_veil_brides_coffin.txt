Song:

Take your crosses
I'll live without them
Standing wet in holy rain.
When you were baptized
Ignored the problem
That's when I watched you seal your grave.

I tried to save you
But let you drink the pain
A final song now we both know.
So I'm not givin' up
Won't let you suffocate me
You find your hell-less home.

I don't owe you anything
You'll only die a dream forgotten.
I've got my pride so hear me sing
I'll never let you steal my coffin.

Words as weapons
Pierced into you
So self-righteous, have it your way
I'm alive and now I'm burning
Say a prayer to end today

I tried to save you
But let you drink the pain
A final song now we both know.
So I'm not givin' up
Won't let you suffocate me
You find your hell-less home.

I don't owe you anything
You'll only die a dream forgotten.
I've got my pride so hear me sing
I'll never let you steal my coffin.

Never let you steal my afterlife!
Never let you steal my afterlife!

*Instrumental*

So I'm not givin' up
Won't let you suffocate me
You find your hell-less home.

I don't owe you anything
You'll only die a dream forgotten.
I've got my pride so hear me sing
I'll never let you steal my coffin.

I don't owe you anything
You'll only die a dream forgotten.
I've got my pride so hear me sing
I'll never let you steal my coffin.
