Song:

It's probably just the things I do
That make me vital for you
There's a breaking point in us all

Explore the world we must
Time's just to short for the best of us
Before death comes

I will be
There for you
Even through
Thick and thin
I will never fall
When hope is lost

But now I see
The hour hand moving faster and faster
Our time is running out
Move quick or never remember
Open your eyes and you'll see

It's probably just the things I do
That make me vital for you
There's a breaking point in us all
(A point we never want to reach)

Explore the world we must
Time's just to short for the best of us
Before death comes

Take me away
Away from here
'Cause everyday
Is turning into years
With every moment
I feel deeper and deeper
My hearts a sinking ship

And now I see
The hour hand moving faster and faster
Our time is running out
Move quick or never remember
Open your eyes and you'll see

It's probably just the things I do
That make me vital for you
There's a breaking point in us all
(A point I never want to reach)

Explore the world we must
Time's just to short for the best of us
Before death comes

Life's just to short to go and throw it away
It's all we have let's make the best of today
And now I see, the hour hand moving faster and faster

It's probably just the things I do
That make me vital for you
There's a breaking point in us all

Explore the world we must
Time's just to short for the best of us
Before death comes

It's probably just the things I do
That make me vital for you
There's a breaking point in us all
(A point we never want to reach)

Explore the world we must
Time's just to short for the best of us
Before death comes

Ohh s**t!
