Song:

Are you lonely?
Are you Crying?
Are those teardrops in your eyes
Is it more blues, is is bad news,
Is it a curse?, or a blessing in disguise.

Did you leave him?, do you love him?
Have you said your, said your last goodbyes
Is it over, hey
Are you sorry?
Could it be a blessing in disguise

It's the scars that make you stronger
It's the hard times that make you wise,
It's the sweet things that only time bring, yeah
That arrive like a blessing in disguise
Ooooooooohhhhh!

Clouds roll by, and bring the rain
Tears will dry to ease the pain
Oh!

Are you lonely?
Are you Crying?
Are those teardrops in your eyes
Is it more blues, is is bad news,
Is it a curse?, or a blessing in disguise.

Is it a curse or a blessing in disguise
Is it a curse or a blessing in disguise
Is it a curse or a blessing in disguise
