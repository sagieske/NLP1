Song:

All the music I've got...
Couldn't save the love you lost
Couldn't pave another day into our love
In the court where you are queen
And your love, it reigns supreme
What have I got?
Nothing, babe

I won't say that I understand when I really can't
I'm no hero, I'm just a man aching for your hands
So if you say our love is gone, then I guess I'm moving on
Here's my lousy excuse for moving on

Sure we've taken turns
They weren't always for the worst
They'll be more than one time where you'll think back and smile
And though I could not afford
All the things you asked me for
You know my love for you it always came first

I won't say that I understand when I really can't
I'm no hero, I'm just a man aching' for your hands
So if you say our love is gone, then I guess I'm moving on
Here's my lousy excuse for moving on

I will never forget your shapely silhouette
Nor the beautiful parts of your face you say you hate
So If takes forever for me to get over you
So be it, babe

I won't say that I understand when I really can't
I'm no hero, I'm just a man, can't you see I am
So if you say your love is gone, then I guess I'm moving on
Here's my lousy excuse for moving on
