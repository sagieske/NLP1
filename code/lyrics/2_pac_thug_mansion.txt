Intro:
s**t, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
n****s need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
n****s ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do n****s go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug n***a, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion
Verse 1:
A place to spend my quiet nights, Time to unwind,
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times,
I once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
But when I held that nine all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery and poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for better days, Promised to hold on
Me and my dogs don't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we could drink liquor and no one bickers over trick s**t
A spot where we could smoke in peace
And even though we Gs,
We still visualize places that we could roll a piece
And in my minds eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
Got a spot for us all, So we can ball
At Thug'z Mansion
Chorus:
Ain't no place id rather be
chillin' with homies and family
sky high iced out paradise in the sky(thugz Manison.)
Aint no place id rather be
only place that's right for me
chromed out manison in paradise in the sky
Verse 2:
Will I survive all the fights in the darkness? Trouble sparks
They tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattoo tears and couldn't sleep
Good for multiple years Witness peers catch gunshots,
Nobody cares see the politicians ban us,
They'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head with the little bit of homeboys that remain
Cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to grow? If ya find it, I'll be right behind ya,
Show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful?
I'm coming from the bottom Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot
Em
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape the deadly places
Slanging drugs
In Thugz Mansion
Chorus
Verse 3:
Dear mama don't cry, Your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook
Drinking peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm till the day came
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion
Chorus
