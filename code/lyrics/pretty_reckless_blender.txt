1, 2, 3, 4
I used to hate you
But now I love you
So like a rose
So like a rose
But when you kiss me I wanna slap you
But sorry it's lost
The feeling is lost
I chew my nails down
I look at the ground
I am pissed
I am shy
Cause you threw me in a blender
I am hot
I am cold
Do you wanna get to know me
Do you wanna learn to get inside my head
Do you wanna get to touch me
Cause now my ex is officially dead
I don't lalalala like you
I lalalala love you
I used to hahaha hate you
And now I really f*****g love you

I'm feeling stupid
But I won't tell you
I am blond
I feel dumb
I sound sweetly in the daytime
Night I'll turn, night I'll turn
I smoke my eyes out
Hoping you'll shout
Be my girlfriend
Be my girlfriend
And when you just flirt
I'll tell you it hurts
I want more
I want more
So you do you wanna get to know me
Do you wanna learn to get inside my head
Do you wanna get to touch me
Cause now my ex is officially dead
I don't lalalala like you
I lalalala love you
I used to hahaha hate you
And now I really f*****g love you

Could you, could you, could you, could you keep a secret
Would you, would you, would you, would you wanna keep it
Wouldn't, wouldn't wanna make a scandal
But I can get ya, get ya, get ya by the handle
And if you, if you, if you really feel me
Then you got me, got me, got me thinking maybe
For a minute or maybe to we're not in public
I'll make you lalalala lovesick
I don't lalalala like you
I lalalala love you
I used to hahaha hate you
But now I really f*****g love you
I don't lalalala like you
I lalalala love you
I used to hahaha hate you
But now I really f*****g love you
