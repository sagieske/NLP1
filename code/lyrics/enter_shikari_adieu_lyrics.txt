Song:

And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home
[x2]

I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder, that life is unkind
At the best of times

And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home

I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder, that life is unkind
At the best of times

(Brace your self, cause I think I'm coming for you. Look up into the sky)

Home could be anywhere, when I am holding you...
