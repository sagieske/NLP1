Song:

(Lainie Marsh)

I hear the clock a tickin'
See the sweat upon my brow
I know my destination
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'm running on desire
Baby I've got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel

Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go

There's a junkyard dog a barkin'
In the valley down below
He's wanting me to stop and
Gather up a heavy load
Ain't gonna heed his call
Ain't givin' him the time of day
You mangy mutt once and for all
I said I threw that stuff away

I won't have a bit of trouble
Heading down the straight and true
I'll fly solo on the double
Into the yonder blue

I might need some intervention
Out upon the icy turn
In a foggy situation
Squealin' on a hairpin curve

I'm running on desire
Baby I've got nerves of steel
Coming down to the wire
Lord above me guide the wheel

Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Keep me in your prayers tonight
I'll be weary upon that road
I know the finish line's in sight
But I still have a ways to go
Got a ways to go, got a ways to go
