Song:

All around you slow decay
Wanna feel the sun of the new day
Forget the chances that you lost
Shedding innocence like falling dust
All the things you learned too young
The songs you knew but you never sung
You Waited a long time, you wasted more
Forgotten what you waited for

Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away

No solutions built to last
Just your petty scores to settle fast
The N. M. E meant nothing to you
And the maker, well the maker of who
Your walkman generation
In search of sweet sedation
While forests choke under a 'lever sky
And the Exxon birds will never fly

Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away

We tried, we cried, we fell, we lied
This life's like one white knuckle ride
Crack babies born too young
And L. A. Kids who will dance to the gun
So forget this so called dirt of mine
It's just the dust and diesel of the passing time
It's all around you it's a tragedy, look
So forget the cover just read the book

Excuse me ma'am for being so rude
Feels like 100 years of solitude
But my mind is numb and my mouth's okay
And you can listen or just walk away
