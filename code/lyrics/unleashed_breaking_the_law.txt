Song:

Originally performed by Judas Priest
The road was completely wasting
Out of working down
All inside it's so first rating
As I turn in town in town
Fill that nobody care
Is darling watch out
Nothing could begin
To put action in my wife
Breaking the law
So much further don't do future
I kept it even start
How on break promise broken
Aching my heart
You don't know what is life
You don't have a clue
If you need you be yourself
Do the same thing too
Breaking the law
You don't know what is the life
