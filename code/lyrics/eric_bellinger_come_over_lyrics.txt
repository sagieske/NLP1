Song:

Hell yeah, I be on some other s**t
Gone with them other n****s they ain’t fuckin with
Hell yeah, show you that it takes a real grown man to lay you down
Yeah baby I be killin s**t, gotta be a real n***a and a gentleman
All night, I’ma have you feelin just how you want to, just

Say that, say that,
I can take your for a ride if you with that
If you single, I’ma beat it, wanna change that
I ain’t spittin game girl I really mean that
Oh, whoa, bet I can make you come
Over and take your lover
Just by the way you’re lookin, I already know
I got you in that zone, don’t act like we ain’t grown
I’m tryina give you what you want girl

[Hook:]
So if you wanna come, come over
Said if you wanna come, come over
Said if you wanna come, come over yeah
Said if you wanna come, come over
Said if you wanna come, come over
Said if you wanna come, come over

Hell yeah, take you to the dealership
Anything you want, that’s the one we leaving with
Got racks on deck for tonight, we tryina go all out
Yeah, I’ma be a problem, cause when you all alone
You gonn wanna call me
And when I get there I’ma have you feeling just how you want
Say that, say that,

If you single, I’ma beat it, wanna change that

Oh, whoa, bet I can make you come
Over and take your lover

Better yet a treasures, bring a couple treasures
Get ready for explosion

Soon as they awake they call me for another date
I tell I take you out to eat as long as d**k is on your p***y

Oh, whoa, bet I can make you come
Over and take your lover
