Song:

(Fade up)
Chase a rainbow;
Chase a rainbow;
Chase a rainbow.
Chase your rainbow anywhere you find it;
And maybe you'll find it tomorrow.
Love is a rainbow to light up your life;
It's a strong wind that blows away sorrow.
Chorus:
When you walk along a lonely road,
When you're down, and all the world can see,
When you want to run away and hide,
You need someone to believe in -- believe in me.
Chase your rainbow;
Chase your rainbow;
Chase your rainbow;
Chase your rainbow.
Round and round, let your rainbow surround you,
Reflections to colour your day.
You'll find someone to share all your dreams,
Feel your loneliness fading away.
[Chorus:]
Chase a rainbow;
Chase your rainbow;
Chase a rainbow;
Chase your rainbow;
Chase a rainbow;
Chase your rainbow.
