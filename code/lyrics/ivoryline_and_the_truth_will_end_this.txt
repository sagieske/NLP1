Song:

I'm sorry to be so pointed
But I thought I'd save us both some time
And get myself disconnected
Then work on getting you back in line
I can't believe you'd be so naive
How can anyone be so naive

I hope that all of the pride that you've felt
Will melt away with this pre-chorus

This song's in a format so I know
That you can wrap your head found it
I know you'll find before you go
That you have faked
Where are all your friends now that you've done this?
I bet you feel fine since you have yourself

Just because you cry when confronted
That does not mean that you are right
I'd rather be completely blunt
And get everything out into the light
I suggest you get your facts straight
I suggest you get your self straight

I hope that all of the pride that you've felt
Will melt away with this. This moment

I bet you feel just perfectly fine
I won't stop til I turn your insides out

This song's in a format so I know that you
I know you'll find before
You go that you have faked it
This song's in a format so I know
That you can wrap your head round this
