Song:

Colour me your colour, baby
Colour me your car
Colour me your colour, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your colour chart
I know where you're coming from
Call me (Call me) on the line
You can call me, call me anytime
Call me (Call me) for a ride
You can call me any day or night
Call me, yeah
Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi
Call me (Call me) on the line
You can call me, call me anytime
Call me (Call me) for a ride
When you're ready we can share the wine
Call me, yeah
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day, anyway
Call me (Call me) on the line
You can all me, call me anytime
Call me (Call me) my love
You can call me in a sweet design
Call me (Call me) for a ride
You can call me for some overtime
Call me (Call me) call me for your lover's lover's alibi
Yeah
