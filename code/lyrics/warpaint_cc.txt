Song:

Guarding so sad, spending dizzy

Give me more, give me more
Give me more, I haven't had this before
Then open out for this one
Hold it now for love
Changing my mind sober
And fell, and still

Guarding so sad, spending dizzy
Guarding so sad, spending dizzy

Give me more, give me more
Give me more, I haven't had this before
Give me more, give me more
Give me more, I haven't had this before

Then open out for this one
Hold it now for love
Changing my mind sober

Give me more, give me more
