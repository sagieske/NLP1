Song:

What has come over me
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away
To fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, begging a question
Why?

For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over
Now on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus:]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away
To feast upon the(the night)
Source of my felicity
Dark Maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away from hibernation
Strong and unafraid
Never a question why

For saving me from all they've taken
Letting my armor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over now
On a path to take it away
There can be no better way of knowing

[Chorus:]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

[Guitar Solo]

Give in to the night

[Chorus:]
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

Night [x3]
Give into the Night
Night [x3]
Give into the Night [x2]
