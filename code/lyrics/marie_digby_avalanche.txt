Song:

Since when do you come around?
And the temperature's changed, nothing's the same
Left me, in yesterday
You don't see me that way, touched me that way, no more
When you get so cold, I'm not sure just how much longer I can hold

You got me standin' at the bottom of this mountain that we've made (mountain that we've made)
And the ground is shakin' from all of our mistakes (all of our mistakes)
But there's no one, nothing but us is in our way
It's a matter of time, We can rewind

If you only knew, What my heart would do for you
I'm tryna break through, Don't you think it's worth the chance?
Let's leave the past, Is that too much to ask?
And where do we stand? (Where do we stand?)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, oh, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, yeah, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche, ooooh)

We see what's up ahead, Why do we stay? Watchin' us fadin'
Trapped in, by regret
There's no way out, when there's no way in (no)
And it's so cold, I'm not sure just how much longer I can hold

You got me standin' at the bottom of this mountain that we've made (mountain that we've made)
And the ground is shakin', from all of our mistakes (all of our mistakes)
But there's no one, nothing but us is in our way
It's a matter of time, We can rewind

If you only knew, What my heart would do for you
I'm tryna break through, Don't you think it's worth the chance?
Let's leave the past, Is that too much to ask?
And where do we stand? (Where do we stand?)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, oh, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, yeah, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche, ooooh)

The bond is breaking, and it's taking over, my spirit (quickly, quickly)
Something's shifted, have we drifted too far, apart now?

If you only knew, What my heart would do for you
I'm tryna break through, Don't you think it's worth the chance?
Let's leave the past, Is that too much to ask?
And where do we stand? (Where do we stand?)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, oh, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche)
Can we pull through this avalanche? (avalanche, avalanche, yeah, this avalanche, avalanche, avalanche, ooooh)
