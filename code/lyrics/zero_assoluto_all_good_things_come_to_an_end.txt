Honestly what will become of me
don't like reality
It's way too clear to me
But really life is daily
We are what we don't see
Missed everything daydreaming

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end

Solo cos?
potrei ritrovare
il coraggio di
di riprovarci nonostante tutto
correre lontano da qua
adesso
chiedersi qual era il perch?
domani
torneremo cos?, torner? cos? da te da te da te da t da te...

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
come to an end come to an...
Why do all good things come to end?

Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Die...

lo sento gi?: ? come perdersi...
se provi a crederci
prover? cos?
io posso crederci
torner? cos?... torneremo cos?

Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to end?
come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?

Well the dogs were barking at the new moon
whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
and the dogs were barking at the new moon
whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
so that they could
Die die die die die
