Song:

Speaking in Spanish

[Verse:]
Never feel alone
Never feel theres no one there who cares for you
When every door seems closed mine is opened wide for you
I'll give you strength, restore your faith
I'm the one who will be around when it all falls down
I will hold you

{Chorus}
I'll be there if you break
I'll be there if you crumble
Come to you if you come under
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the pieces back in place.. If you break

[Verse 2:]
Never feel ashamed
Never feel this weak if you should reach for me
[?] I'll be there to set you free
I'll give you love
I'll lift you up
I'm the one who'll be around if it all falls down
I will hold you

{Chorus}

[Bridge:]
But if there comes a time when I might need someone..
Will you be there??
Say you'll be there!!!

Be there if I break
Be thereif I crumble
Come to me if I come under
Catch me if I stumble
I'll do what it takes to put pieces back in place
If you break

I'll be there if you break
Be there if you crumble.. Oho
Come to you if you come under
Catch you if you stumble
I'll do what it takes to put the piecces back in place if you break

If you break
If you break!
