Demi:
I love the way you're talking
I'm loving what you're doing boy
I don't fall easy often
I never had a love like you before
I like you put your number put your number in my phone yeah
You heard me right so call me call me when you're all alone

Chorus
Don't make plans
Come home with me we'll stay up all night long
I want you and I want you bad
Lets keep the party going all night long
Lets keep the party going all night long
All night long (x6)A-A-A all night

Demi:
I'm on another planet
I'm in another universe
You may not understand it
Sooner or later baby you will learn
I like you put your number put your number in my phone, yeah
You heard me right so call me call me when you're all alone-lone (x5)

Chorus
Don't make plans
Come home with me we'll stay up all night long
I want you and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long
All night long (x6) A-A-All night

Missy Elliot:
We can party all night
Want to spend the night
Will you be my type by the end of the night
We can pillow fight
Your kisses real nice
Come closer cause I don't bite
You talking how I like
You play daddy I'll play wife
I'm so alone no one is home
I got your number in my telephone
Wanna, wanna, wanna be your girl
Wanna, wanna, wanna be my babe
Boy we hold hands... [Fr]
It's the weekend don't make plans

Party's starts(when you're here) x2
After dark (we don't care)
We gon' set it off
We we gon' set it off

Chorus
Don't make plans
Come home with me we'll stay up all night long
I want you and I want you bad
Let's keep the party going all night long
Let's keep the party going all night long
All night long
