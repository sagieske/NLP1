Song:

Our love has come and gone
I've been loving you too long
I feel so lonely in your arms
And our love is almost gone
I've grown tired of your kiss
And our loving I won't miss

Our love has come and gone
I've been loving you too long
Our love has come and gone
Been loving you too long

I felt so close to you
You felt so close to me
I'll never lose those memories
Of how we loved so tenderly
Now our love has gone away
And there's nothing left to say

Our love has come and gone
I've been loving you too long
Our love has come and gone
Been loving you too long

You're always on the run
Won't be here when you come
I've waited oh so long
But our love has come and gone

Our love has come and gone
I've been loving you too long
Our love has come and gone
Been loving you too long
