Song:

(Harry)
Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the door and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

(Zayn)
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams!"

(All)
And we danced all night to
The best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cos we danced all night to
The best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes... Woo!

(Liam)
Said her name was Georgia Rose
And her daddy was a dentist

(Harry)
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

(Niall)
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams!"

(All)
And we danced all night to
The best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cos we danced all night to
The best song ever I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes... Woo!

(Louis)
You know, I know, you know
I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know
You'll remember me

(Zayn)
You know, I know, you know
I'll remember you
I know, you know, 
I hope you'll remember
How we danced
How we danced (One, two, one, two, three,four)

(All)
How we danced all night (How we danced)
To the best song ever
We knew every line (We knew every line)
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her
'Cos we danced all night to (We danced, we danced)
The best song ever (It's always something like this)
And we danced all night
To the best song ever
We knew every line
Now I can't remember
How it goes but I know
That I won't forget her (That I won't forget her)
'Cos we danced all night to
The best song ever (Best song ever)
I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes... Woo!

(Zayn)
Best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
It was the best song ever
