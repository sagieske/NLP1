I gave you a part of me
When life was free
The love was inside of us
But I let it be

Now I see what a fool I've been
And I feel what it means
To send you away like that
And never hold you again!

You're in my eyes, in my head
In my soul I feel you there!
Oh Camilla light this world again, woah

All my night, everyday
I've been calling out your name
Oh Camilla life got right again
Life got right again!

I gave you a part of me
When life was free
The love was inside of us
But I let it be

Now I see what a fool I've been
And I feel what it means
To send you away like that
And never hold you again!

You're in my eyes, in my head
In my soul I feel you there!
Oh Camilla light this world again, woah

All my night, everyday
I've been calling out your name
Oh Camilla life got right again
Life got right again!
