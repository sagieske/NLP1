Song:

I got a girlfriend
Only she don't know it yet
I got a six string best friend
Who sleeps with a broken neck
I want to make my mark
Change the world, with this flow
But, all this doubt in my head
It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to lock my door and shut out all the world surrounding me
Safe from the problems and the pressures caused by insecurities

Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll!
Get up! Get up!
Take my heart and my soul!
Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
On and on and on..

Feel like everybody else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives
Come on and let me go
And just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

I got a heartache
She's my insecurity
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me
I want to breakout, Carpe Diem,
I know, but all this doubt in my head It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to find my own direction on this busy one-way street
Where all the influential people never bother helping me

Get up Get up!
Let the good times roll
Get up Get up!
Take my heart and my soul!
Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
One and on and on..

Feel like everybody else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives
Come on and let me go
And just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

This is the Anthem
Out to all the misfits
If you feel you don't belong
If you don't give a s**t
About authority
About majority
About conformity
Shout it out
Let us go! [x7]

Everybody else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives
Just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives

Feel like everybody else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in
We shout the anthem of our lives
Just like everybody else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives
