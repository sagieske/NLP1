Song:

One lie, two lies
I shoulda said shoe flies
Shame on me
I usually see through lies
Said you loved me, yeah right
I thought we were air tight
You were playing foul
It was far from a fair fight
I hung onto your every word
Sweetest s**t I ever heard
I even made you pinky swear
Just so I was reassured
The rumors started gettin back
That so and so was hittin' that
Silly me for being such
A 'natic for that kitty cat

You told me it's the truth
But I'm still afraid
I'm not the one
That would jump the gun
If I had proof
I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

Three lies, four lies
You shoulda been a tour guide
The way you lead me on
Knowing I was one of four guys
Said you loved me, okay
Where were you the other day?
Your car was parked at 38th
But you were
At your mothers place?
Your mother lives on Broadway
I followed you all day

I called but you ignored it
When you kissed him
In the hallway
Call me crazy, call me odd
Call me what you want to
But Karma is a b***h
I pray to God
She always haunts you

You told me it's the truth
But I'm still afraid
I'm not the one
That would jump the gun
If I had proof
I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love
But the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you
To take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun

I need my sunglasses
I need my sunglasses

You told me it's the truth
But I'm still afraid
I'm not the one
That would jump the gun
If I had proof
I'd take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
You said you were in love
But the games you played
I hope that you're having fun
You see I need you
To take off my shades
And be blinded by the sun
