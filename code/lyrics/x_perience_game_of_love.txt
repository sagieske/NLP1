Song:

Its just one year ago
that I've met you at a show
you were the clown
I was the fool

Right now it's vice versa
and I know it's just because
youve always been
the fool for me

Do we feel the same way
or do want to play the game of love
on and on

You took me to a bar
to tell me who you are
you never know
what you want

And you want me for good
just if you're in the mood
to spend the next
night with me
