Song:

When everything's gone
When everything's on
Give some more
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke

When you're feeling dizzy
Uptight n' easy
Light me a joint
Give me a blow
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

No me gusta la coke
No me gusta la coke
No me gusta la coke
No me gusta la coke

Oooouuuuhhhhhhh, stop.

When everything's gone
When everything's on
Give me some more
How does it feel like?
What are you talking about?

When you're feeling dizzy
Uptight n' easy
Light me a joint
Give me a blow
How does it feel like
What are you talking about

I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke
I don't like drinking coke

We don't like, don't use, don't buy, don't do coke

Come on, get up!
Ahhhhhh

Give me the music!

No coke!
