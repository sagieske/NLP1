Song:

Street lights flicker around my town
When day turns to night that's when I come around
Streets are cold and damp from a midnight rain
Buildings saggin' from the years of pain

Cause I need the feeling
Of living in the night
Well you can have your security
I'll keep on living in the night

Everybody's workin' in the light of the day
I know what I like
Is living in the night

Down on the corner sits a black and white
Got the man in the back and they're readin' his rights
I slip down the alley just to stay out of sight
Looks like the law is gonna miss me tonight

Cause I need the feeling
Of living in the night
When the streets are cold
My blood runs hot in the night

Everybody's workin' in the light of the day
I know what I like
Is living in the night

Another night I spent alone
Embraced by darkness and it's hidden sounds
I turn my blinds against the light
And wait again the coming of the night

Well you can have your security
I'll keep on living in the night
Well I need the feeling
Of living in the night
