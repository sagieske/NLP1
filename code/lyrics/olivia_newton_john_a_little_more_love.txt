Song:

(John Farrar)
Night is draggin' her feet
I wait alone in the heat
I know, know that you'll have your way
Till you have to go home
No's a word I can't say

Cause it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you start depending
Will a little more love bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?

Where, where did my innocence go?
How, how was a young girl to know?
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms
In the web of your lies

But it gets me nowhere to tell you no
And it gets me nowhere to make you go
Will a little more love make you start depending
Will a little more love bring a happy ending
Will a little more love make it right?
Will a little more love make it right?
