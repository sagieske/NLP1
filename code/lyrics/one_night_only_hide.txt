Song:

Here old friend
Come over
And tell me a joke
Why don't you

Don't hide from what you want
Don't hide from what you want

One last chance
Don't blow it
Think i'm feeling fine today
One last chance
To make it
Think i'm feeling great today
Think i'm feeling great today

Dont hide from what you want
Dont hide from what you want
you want you want
