Song:

It feels just like it was yesterday
We were in love 
Why's it falling apart
I've never been one to walk away
But I've had enough 
And it's breaking my heart

Cause you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do
No it's nothing you say
Yeah baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl No, not today

Cause I want it bad I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby, bad I want it bad

I want a girl who stays out too late
And when I call 
She doesn't answer the phone
Oh, I want a girl who likes it her way
And through it all 
I know I'll end up alone

Yeah yeah, you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do No no, it's nothing you say
Oh pretty baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl, No not today Mmm

Cause I want it bad I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad I want a bad girl, baby, bad I want it bad

I'm getting sick of predictable Tired of acting logical
Oh yeah, I gotta shake it up tonight
Yeah girl I want something physical
Not something invisible, oh yeah
I'm tired of being good, let's be bad
I want a bad girl baby, bad
And I want a love that's crazy, yeah

I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah I wanna fight
I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad I want a bad girl, baby, bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I wanna fight I wanna rock and roll and party all night
Yeah, I want it bad
