Song:

It seems like only yesterday you were with somebody else
Soon as it was over though I had claimed you for myself
Didn't take me long before I had made myself to yours
Glad to leave the past behind and I'm glad to close the door

Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya

So far has been so good, it seems we stand test of time
You never call me baby but you refer to me as mine
What I like the best is how you can keep me on my toes
Staying home with you is better than sticking things up my nose

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost this feeling, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well that's swell

You sleep with your mouth wide open and you go to the park alone
You only cook from frozen but I don't ever hear you moan
You let me lie in bed when you're doing breakfast with the kids
Landing on my feet with you, I'm so happy with is how we live

Because you know I love ya
Because you know I love ya

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost this feeling, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well that's swell

I had that awful feeling, that I needed help
My life had lost this feeling, but you saved me from myself
As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well that's swell

As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well that's swell

As long as I've got you and we can be
together and forever just you and me, well that's swell
