Song:

I can not breath I'm going down
All I can feel is I don't wanna be around
My head just squeals I can not cope
With all this hurt might as well swing from a rope
I'd like to break free
I'd like to scream and shout
I'd like to paint the words all over the whole f*ckin' world that
I want out
I want out
I want out
I want out
You'll never know or understand
How it feels when you hold the void in your hand
I think of what is and what could be
I wonder if the man in the mirror is me
I'd like to break free...
I want out::
If I should fail and completely
Lock me up somewhere and please throw away the key
Should I go insane if I should fall
I want no one to scrape me off my damn walls
I'd like to break free...
I want out::
