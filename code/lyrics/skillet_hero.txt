Song:

I'm just a step away,
I'm a just a breath away,
Losin' my faith today.
(And fallin' off the edge today)

I am just a man,
Not superhuman.
(I'm not superhuman)
Someone save me from the hate.

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's just another war,
Just another family torn.
(And fallin' off the edge today)
Just a step from the edge,
Just another day in the world we live.

[Chorus:]
I need a hero!
To save me now, I need a hero.
(Save me now)
I need a hero!
To save my life, a hero will save me.
(Just in time)

I've gotta fight today,
To live another day,
Speakin' my mind today.
(My voice will be heard today)

I've gotta make a stand,
But I am just a man.
(I'm not superhuman)
My voice will be heard today!

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's just another war,
Just another family torn.
(My voice will be heard today)
It's just another kill,
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves.

[Chorus:]
I need a hero!
To save me now, I need a hero.
(Save me now)
I need a hero!
To save my life, a hero will save me.
(Just in time)
I need a hero!
To save my life, a hero will save me.
Just in time!

Save me just in time, save me just in time.

Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives.
And we're not ready to die.

Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I've got a hero,
(I've got a hero)
Livin' in me!

I'm gonna fight for what's right,
Today I'm speaking my mind.
And if it kills me tonight,
I will be ready to die.

A hero's not afraid to give his life,
A hero's gonna save me just in time!

[Chorus:]
I need a hero!
To save me now, I need a hero.
(Save me now)
I need a hero!
To save my life, a hero will save me.
Just in time!

[Outro:]
I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for what's right?
Who's gonna help us survive?
I need a hero!
Who's gonna fight for the weak?
Who's gonna make 'em believe?
I need a hero. I need a hero!
A hero gonna save me just in time!
