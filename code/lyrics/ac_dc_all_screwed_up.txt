Song:

Get ready
You think you're kind of tough
You're walking down the road
When you want any more
Your girlfriend's???????????
Things got tough
And you strut your stuff
And I want your?????
And you're out of luck
Yes you are
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
If you want to kick some butt
????????
And when you can't take no more
Then she pushed you out the door
When things go hot
Like a dog gone mad
She can pack some punch
And you're out to lunch
Black and white
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
?????????
All screwed up
Yeah yeah
Yeah
It's all screwed up
All screwed up
??? All screwed up
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
Yeah it is
All screwed up
All screwed up
All screwed up
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
She can pack
?????? Some punch
But you're all out to lunch
All screwed up
It's all screwed up
It's all screwed up
Yes it is
All screwed up
Yeah
It's all screwed up
Yeah
