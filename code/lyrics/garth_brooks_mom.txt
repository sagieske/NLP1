Song:

A little baby told God,
Hey I'm kinda scared, don't really know if
I wanna go down there,
Because from here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small.

Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too? '
And God said, 'Oh child, of course I do,
But there's somebody special that's waiting for you
