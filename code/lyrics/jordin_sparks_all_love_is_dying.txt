Song:

The further I fall I'm beside you
As lost as I get I will find you
The day where I drown I can breath
When I surrender I'm free

If the world should break into, 
Somehow we'll make it through
We know we've got to hate what they fear
We can't let them make this dissapear

Help me understand what's going on
Cuz now were barly holding on
We used to be so strong, our love is dying
As long as there's a breath inside
Love will make sure we survive
This isn't over

If our love is dying
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life

If our love is dying
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life

The distance it brings us closer
The struggle will make us stronger
The passionly nights of fire
Is no point in fighting

If the world should break into, 
Somehow we'll make it through
We know we've got (we've got)
To hate (to hate) what they fear
We can't let them make this dissappear

Help me understand what's going on
Cuz now were barly holding on
We used to be so strong, our love is dying
As long as there's a breath inside
Love will make sure we survive
This isn't over our love is dying

Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
If our love is dying

Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
(Ohh)

I'm never leaving your side
I'm willing to put up a fight
We've worked to hard to let this thing die (ohh don't care if I die)
Don't care if I have to cry
If it takes everything inside
We've worked to hard to let this thing die
Our love aint dying
No our love aint dying
(Help me to understand)

Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
Can we bring it
Back to life
If our love is dying

If our love is dying can we bring it back to life
