Song:

I've been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong
How we, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see
You're too pretty to left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
Cause you gonna do what you wanna do


Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me

It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes

Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
Come on girl, won't you go with me
