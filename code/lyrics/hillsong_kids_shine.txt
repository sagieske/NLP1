Song:

Like a candle,
High on a hill,
I will, I will, I will shine for you
Like a lighthouse,
On the ocean blue,
I will, I will, I will shine for you

I will shine, I will shine for you,
Giving praise, in everything I do,
I will shine, for all the world to see,
Your the, shining light in me,

Like a bright star,
In the night,
I will, I will, I will shine for you,
Like a moonbeam,
Shining through,
I will, I will, I will shine for you,

I will shine, I will shine for you,
Giving praise, in everything I do,
I will shine, for all the world to see,
Your the, shining light in me,

No bushel,
No dark night,
No rain clouds gonna hide my light,
And my whole world through,
I'm gonna shine for you,
Til' the whole world sees,
Jesus in me!

Like a candle,
High on a hill,
I will, I will, I will shine for you,
Like a lighthouse,
On the ocean blue,
I will, I will, I will shine for you,

I will shine, I will shine for you,
Giving praise, in everything I do,
I will shine, for all the world to see,
Your the shining light in me,
