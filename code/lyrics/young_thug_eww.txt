[Verse 1: Young Thug]
What you gonna do when I pull up on you n***a?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
P***y n***a know that he a cat like Tigger
For sure, for sure
Beat the p***y n***a with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns coming out the hatch
P***y mother f****are scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
One me to deliver make a n***a reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fu***n' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
How many n****s standin' around you would die for you?
Wouldn't I be a funny m*******a sprayin' at them n****s on they four wheelers
Honestly, truthfully told, ysl won't fold
N***a sell dope from the balcony walk into the house and change clothes
Ysl wipe a n***a nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
N***a go and stab that, smack that s**t
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a n***a think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your b***h
I'ma f**k for the cash then she gettin' robbed by tick

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Hundred bands inside of my pants
Make the mothafucka dance on the stage
B***h it's a parade
Po'in 4s is a sport Leanarade
50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
B***h got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen rappin' rappin' like cypher
You know damn well I like her, I'ma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin trailed by sniper
How the f**k you feel I don't mean nothin
All them mills in the bando no clean nothin
Run and tell the cop, tell em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like "SIKE!"
B***h I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truck load
Me and Scooter take a trip to Lil' Mexico
All I ever wanted was money, all I ever wanted was the money
Put your hands in the air if you dare any m**********are to step over here F&N put em in a wheel chair

[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww
