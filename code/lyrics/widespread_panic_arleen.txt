Song:

Arleen was a G what a G
Arleen was a G what a G
Arleen was a G what a G
Arleen was a G what a G

Life was a thing that money could buy
Rich would live and the poor would die
Life was thing that money could buy
Rich would live and the poor would die

Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream
What a G what a G
Lean sideway

Woke up in the morning about 10: 13
Six pack of stout a stick of sensi
Woke up this morning what do I see
No no no, it's not like it, like it

Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G

{Panic!}

Why does a rich man drink champagne?
Drink half a beer feel all the same
Life was a thing that money could buy
Rich would live and the poor would die

El Nino!
Electricity out, mine's out
Cat's been out for days
Hear it hollering on the trees over the sky

Lord Lord Lord Lord!
Can't stand it, no
Can't stand it, no
No no no I can't stand it, no
No no no I can't stand it, no

Life was a thing that money could buy
Rich would live and the poor would die
Why does a rich man drink champagne
Drink half a beer feel all the same

Woke up this morning
Woke up this morning about 10: 13
Six pack of stout a stick of sensi
Go in the kitchen what do I see
No electricity
No tv
No Andy
I got my uncle (???)
Watch a whole hour of goodness and old time black and white
Loving that Barney boy

Lord!
Can't stand it, no
No no no I can't stand it, no
No no no I can't stand it, no
No no no I can't stand it, no

Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
Arleen was a dream what a G
