Song:

You, you turn and walk away
I didn't know what to say
I close my eyes to hide
The pain I felt inside

I could never understand
How love went out of hand
And now there's nothing I can do

Though the feeling hasn't passed
Sad to say our love didn't last
Please don't ask me to pretend
'Cause I know it's over

When I'm done forgetting you
You can say what you wanna do
Please don't ask me to pretend
'Cause I know it's over now

Now, I'm left here all alone
A heart without a home
How will I ever find
The love I left behind

Once the days were ours to share
Now you don't even care
And there's still nothing I can do

Though the feeling hasn't passed
Sad to say our love didn't last
Please don't ask me to pretend
'Cause I know it's over

When I'm done forgetting you
You can say what yopu wanna do
Please don't ask me to pretend
'Cause I know it's over now
