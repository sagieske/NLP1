Song:

Oh, love of my life
Destined forever
I will be right here by your side
No falling tears when we're
Together
You know the joy you bring to
Me.

Refrain:
Never, there'll be no other
We'll share as lovers
Right from the heart
From my mind to your soul
I will give it to you girl
My every little thing
That I'm more than willing
I will give to you.

Chorus:
Forever starts from now I
Promise you
Lovin' you is all that I can do
No one can take it away from me
Nobody but you.

Ohh... Now is the time stars will be bright
Our bodies will groove all through the night
Come take my hand then we will fly high
Come on baby hear me say

(Repeat refrain & chorus)

Bridge:
There'll be no time for sad goodbyes
Without you here I can't get by
Don't you go away.

(Repeat refrain & chorus)

Wooohh only you has got to feel, only you baby and baby
You show me baby oohhahhh...
