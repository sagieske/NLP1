Song:

How've you been?
Can I come in?
Just came to get my things, and then I guess I'm leaving.
If I could say, what you'd like to hear,
I'd whisper in your ear, it's only temporary.

But I've been taking you for granted
And I thought you'd feel the same as me.
It's time that I come clean but,
But for now can we, just both pretend to sleep?
Sometimes the one you want is not the one you need.
What goes around, don't come around.
You should know me by now.

Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
I should know you as well
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me by now,

Our talk is small, I'm seven inches tall
And you should keep the apartment.
So here's my keys, changed all the bills.
We're only built to spill, and wonder where the heart went.

And you've been taking me for granted
And I thought you feel the same as me.
It's time that I come clean but,
But for now can we, just both pretend to sleep?
Sometimes the one you want, is not the one you need.
What goes around, don't come around.
You should know me by now.

Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
I should know you as well.
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me by now.

I know that I remember you, I think that you remember me too.
How can one of us still feel blessed when the other one's lost?
I know you got to feel the change, it just get's worse when it stays the same.
How can one of us still feel blessed when the other one is so lost?

By now!

Sometimes the one you want, is not the one you need.
What goes around, don't come around.
But don't you know me by now?

Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
I should know you as well.
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me
Better than, better than, better than,
You should know me by now.
