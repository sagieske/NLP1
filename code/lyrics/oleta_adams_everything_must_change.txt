Song:

Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of

Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky

And hummingbirds do fly
Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon

Yes, everything will change
The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time

Nothing and no one goes unchanged
There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except

Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

Everything must change
No one stays the same
No one, no one
Everyone must change
Nothing

And the sun
Hummingbirds
Except the rain
Except the music makes me cry
