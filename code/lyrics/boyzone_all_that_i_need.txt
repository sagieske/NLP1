Song:

I was lost and alone
Trying to grow making my way down that long winding road
Had no reason no rhyme
Like a song out of time
And there you were standing in front of my eyes

How could I be such a fool
To let go of love and break all the rules
Girl when you walked down that door
Left a hole in my heart
And now I know for sure

Chorus:
You're the air that I breathe
Girl you're all that I need
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read
You're the light that I see
And your love is all that I need

I was searching in vain
Playing a game
Had no-one else but myself left to blame
You came into my world
No diamonds or pearls Just like a castle of sand
Girl, I almost let love slip right out of my hands
And just like a flower needs rain
I will stand by your side through the joy and the pain

Repeat Chorus X2

You're all that I need, girl
You're the air that I breathe, yeah
And I want to thank you
(And I want to thank you, lady)

You're the words that I read, girl
You're love is all I need, yeah
And I want to thank you
(And I want to thank you, lady)

You're all that I need, girl
You're the air that I breathe, yeah
And I want to thank you..
(Repeat to fade)
