Break My Mind Lyrics

Baby, oh baby, tell the man at the ticket stand
You've changed your mind
Run outside and tell the cab to keep his meter running
'cause if you say 'goodbye' to me boy
You're gonna break my mind

Chorus:
Break my mind, break my mind
You know I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind, break my mind, oh Lord
If you leave you're gonna leave this babbling fool behind

Baby, oh baby, come and get your suitcase off that scale in time.
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flying
'cause if you say good bye to me boy
You're gonna break my mind

[Chorus:]

Baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
