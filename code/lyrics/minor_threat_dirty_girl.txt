Song:

Ugh(echo), ya (echo)
yeah, yeah, yeah
now heres ur chance
yeah, yeah, yeah
you wanna move?
Let's go

She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
Throw ur hands in the air now dirty

If you ain't moving, you aint being touched right
got a smile, light it up like sum flood lights
keep it rock tight, out of sight
body type that I like, wanna touch you, like I just might
ya right, dirty girls in it all night
back and forth, how you rockin, looking mad tight
city night, connect dots like a bright light
nasty girl- you like it dirty right

Chorus
She's the dirty(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
Throw ur hands in the air now dirty
In the hot spot, drop ur top down dirty
She's the dirty(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
Anytime or any place shes got to be cause shes my dirty

My girl don't give a, flow like the riva
shimmie shimmie
Shake ur body down like ya shiva
One's for the money
2's for the cheque
smooth as silk
slick in the leather (come on)
dirty girl with the furs and the feather
she's got a man, but I look much better
sweet but dirty
nasty but girly
back of the club doin dirty, 130
thick but curvy
small but perky
from the car to the bar stay dirty
down to the diggy diggy down
To the boun to the boun
From the front to the back freak nasty
I like it like this, I like it like that
you want it liek this, I want it like that
(fire) while you shake what you got (I'm on fire)
while your makin it hot

Chorus
She's the dirty(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
Throw ur hands in the air now dirty
In the hot spot, drop ur top down dirty

She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
Anytime or any place shes got to be ause shes my dirty

You know I've been watching you

(that's right)
the way you move your body (and it goes like this)
and that thing that you do (dirty girl)
aww, girl I don't even know what to say

Chorus
She's the dirty(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)
She's the dirty girl(dirty girl dirty girl dirty girl)

In the hot spot, drop ur top down dirty

Anytime or any place shes got to be ause shes my dirty
She's down for me casue shes my dirty
