Song:

Would you still want to see me, if you knew how I feel?
You claim you still love him, I can't see how it's real.
We went out for just a drive, it turned into the story of your life.
I've never met a girl as beautiful as you, it may be a craze that I get over you soon
I think if he loved you he'd never make you cry, then we'd both talked and we said say goodbye. Goodbye

Don't speak, I'm dying cuz I know it all.
Don't leave he's only gonna let you fall.
I'm here you know that you could have it all.
Take me I'm never gonna let you fall.

Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.

How's it feel, hurting all the time?
Tell me what it's like putting up with all his lies.
Stick with me and we could leave this town.
Never look back, it's part of the past now (past now).

Don't speak, I'm dying cuz I know it all.
Don't leave he's only gonna let you fall.
I'm here you know that you could have it all.
Take me I'm never gonna let you fall.

Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
Bu-du-dah, Bu-du-dah, bu-dah-du-la-la.
