Song:

I've been doing a lot of thinking
And I know I was wrong
I know we belong together

Look, this is kind of hard
For me to say to you
But I want you back, please
Just give me a second chance

I'm tired of living alone
The single life is not for me
Like a fool, I asked you for my freedom
I didn't think you'd leave so easily

Saw you just the other day
You were walking hand in hand
With someone new

It took me by surprise
And then, I realized
How much I needed you

[Chorus:]
A second chance for us
The second time could be better, baby
A second chance for love
This time around
We could make it, baby

Turn back the hands of time
To the days when you were mine
Ooh, we were so happy together
I never thought that I would
Swallow my pride

Now you're here
So please stay the night
I promise I will make it up to you

Don't ever go away
This love we've got to save
Cause no one else will do, no one

[Chorus:]

I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone

Oh, oh, yeah, ah, ah, yeah

I'm not meant to live alone
Why you being so difficult
You know you want me back
Come on, baby
Why you wanna treat me like that

I'm trying to live my life without you
But I couldn't make it on my own
No, I just can't go on like this, baby
And spend another night alone, oh, oh

[Chorus:]

Oh, yeah, come on, baby
Love me like this
I just want to feel your kiss
Love me like this
