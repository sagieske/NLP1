Song:

Lord You're mighty*
Lord You're mighty

[Verse 1:]
Oh Lord how excellent is Your name in all the earth.
You set Your glory above the heavens and the earth.
When I think of all You've made, the sun, the moon and the stars.
No praise is high enough to express how great You are.

[Verse 2:]
What a mighty God we serve.
Mighty God we serve.
Angles would bow before the mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve.
Mighty God we serve.
Let heaven and the earth adore the mighty God we serve.

Lord You're mighty
Lord You're mighty

[Repeat Verse 1:]

[Repeat Verse 2:]

Hallelujah (4x)
All glory
All honor
All praise
All praise
[Repeat:]

To the mighty God we serve.
Mighty God we serve.
Angles would bow before the mighty God we serve.

Lord You're mighty
Lord You're mighty

What a mighty God we serve.
What mighty God we serve.
Angles would bow before Him.
What a mighty God we serve
