[Verse:]
Yo! I just pulled up on a flight (huh?!)
Audi sr8, Jersey plates like (huh?!)
Dots pointin all in my face like (huh?!)
See the 20 pointers all in my face like (huh?!)
I hate it when the broke n****s speak, I'm like (huh?!)
I go to push yo boy on his feet, I'm like (huh?!)
Pull up on yo block, 100G like (huh?!)
100 guns, 100 clips, 100 Jeeps like (huh?!)
Scratch the M6 on Harlem drive like (huh?!)
Like that's some bullshit, what's with a slide like (huh?!)
Bout to cross the bridge the I slide like (huh?!)
S**t I had to wait a minute for a ride like (huh?!)

[Hook:]
My n***a keep yo head up

Get money, don't let up
When b*****s be fed up

F**k respect we take it, squeeze the plastic like (huh?!)
Checks â€“ we make it then cash it like (huh?!)
Ran to the block when all the addicts like (huh?!)
Handle the rock and then pass it like (huh?!)
Tryna eat in this boy, I need a fork like (huh?!)
He ain't king of New York, f**k what you thought like (huh?!)
I bring that thing to his porch, leave him in chalk like (huh?!)
You got it cheap on the soft, me and my boys like (huh?!)
Bangin with blazers in the Rover like (huh?!)
Slow bucks in the cut, my street fam like (huh?!)
Coke Boys wussup? Mafia height like (huh?!)
D block roll up,

My n***a keep yo head up
And keep yo bread up
Get money, don't let up
When b*****s be fed up
Them n****s be like (huh?!)
N****s be like (huh?!)

Shawty got a mean butt, pushin a mean truck
Get money, her green up
When n****s be tryna f**k

B*****s be like (huh?!)
B*****s be like (huh?!)
Haah! Uh!

[Verse:]
Yo! I play no games in these streets like (huh?!)
