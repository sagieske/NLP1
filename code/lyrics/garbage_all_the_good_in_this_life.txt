Song:

Once when I was a girl
I could have given you a ride for your money
Oh, but how times have changed
Although you do look cute in those red cowboy boots

No, you don't mess around
But you're just a kid, you don't know what it takes

No one can stop you now
Anymore than they can tell the wind not to blow
Who's going to run you now?
With the riders in the dirt back on astelin turf

I can't tell you what to do
You're free as a bird, go do what you've got to do

Don't you worry boy
Life will come and find you
You're going to blow their minds
Show them all a thing or two

Don't you worry boy
Life will come and find you
You're going to blow their minds
Show them all a thing or two

All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
All the good in this life, wish for yourself
