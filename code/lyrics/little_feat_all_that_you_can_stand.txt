B. Wray, B. Payne, P. Barrere

Might be a story you read in a book
'Bout a irl who drank from the devil's cup
Might be someone you know so well
Just might be me, you never can tell
Le dame Laveau burning at the stake
You're the hero, but just a little bit too late
Might be you, might be me
Might be some gris gris that you just can't see
Spirits in the bedroom
Candles in the hall
Shadows on the ceiling
Don't answer the call
I'm gonna take you back
I'm gonna take you way back
And give you
All that you can stand
I'm gonna give you
All that you can stand
Fires off the coast of Martinique
Stories you've heard, you dare not speak
Down on a rampart, you don't go alone
Might be an angel of mercy
Might be a black cat bone
Echoes in the stairwell
Curtains start to blow
Sugar, Honey, a touch of steel
There's something you should know
I'm gonna take you back
I'm gonna take you way back
And give you
All that you can stand
I'm gonna give you
All that you can stand
Dance Colinda on St. John's eve
Bells on her ankles
Makes you believe
Good time dresses on Lake Pontchatrain
A vision in the rain
Spirits in the bedroom
Candles in the hall
Shadows on the ceiling
Don't answer the call
I'm gonna take you back
I'm gonna take you way back
And give you
All that you can stand
I'm gonna give you
All that you can stand
