Song:

I wanna know
If what you said is true
When you said to me
I love you

I wanna know
If I heard it right
What you told me that night
Cos I do too
I love you

[Chorus:]
Oh I've been hurt so many times
I've been told a thousand lines
This time I wanna be sure
Don't wanna cry anymore

You and I know
That we should take our time
But my heart is crossing the line
Cos I love you

[Repeat chorus]

And if your world starts falling apart
Know that I'll be around
To pick up the pieces with you
Cos I love you

Oh you've been hurt so many times
You've been told a thousand lines
This time I gotta be sure
Don't wanna see you cry anymore

I want you to know
That what I'm saying is true
And I'll say it over and over again
I love you
I love you'
