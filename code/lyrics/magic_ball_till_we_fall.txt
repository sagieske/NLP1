Song:

C-murder: (talking)
N***a, between this no limit and tru s**t
You gotta take me out the game to take me from this s**t here boy
This real down here, n****s getting paid
And we gonna stick together and represent it foverever

Chorus: (x2)
We gon? Ball till we fall n***a
I'm gon? Ball till I motherfucking fall

C-murder:
Try to sell a million records, get paid like a bank teller
Have I ever crossed the line, n***a never
I'm gonna ride with the tank to the end
Test me (test me) and watch big v do you in
I only answer to one n***a on this earth
That's the colonel, f**k with him you get hurt
I'm known for catching n****s in their residence
I'd tell you more but that s**t considered evidence
I'm a motherfucking straight shot
I got to have it on the blocks, where a n***a used to slang rocks
But tru n****s smoke weed like trees
No limit n****s cash shecks with no I. D. 's
I never ran from a man in my life
The hardest n***a, but you better have your mind right
Don't snort no coke or shoot heron
B***h I'm crazy on my motherfucking own, and uh,
I ain't about all that getting dressed up s**t
I go to clubs where them thugs hang out b***h
I won't rest till they put my name on the wall
In other words, I'm gonna gonna ball till I motherfucking fall

Chorus x2

Magic:
I'm gonna ball n***a, there's not a man that gon? Stop me
I'm a bad m**********are so these fed's are scared to watch me
I real definition of a thug is me
Mr. Magic m**********are, I know y'all heard of me
Been in it from the beginning, consider my self small
Converted pounds to g's and I ain't never got caught, cause I got heart
That's how I got myself into this position
Now I'm in the game and the fame is an addition
Now vision this 9th ward n***a working meals
Cause I got skills to pay the bills
Feel what I feel
A n***a couldn't pay me to pause
Cause I'm gonna ball til I motherfucking fall n***a

Chorus x4

Us n****s gonna ball till we fall n***a
Feel what I'm saying
No limit and tru records baby, peep this out
" you ain't got a thang, unless you got a tank"
Ha ha
