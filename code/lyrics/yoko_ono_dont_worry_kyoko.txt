-and now yokos gonna do her thing all over you!

Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, kyoko.

Don't worry,
Don't worry, don't worry,
Kyoko, kyoko, kyoko, kyoko, kyoko,
Don't, don't, don't worry, kyoko.
Mums only looking for her hand in the snow,
Mums only looking for her hand in the snow.

Don't -
Don't, don't, don't worry,
Don't worry.

Don't worry, don't worry,
Don't worry -
Don't worry -.
