Song:

Love means so many different things
But you're all that matters
And this is all I'll ever ask of you

Tell me your dreams, so they can be mine too
Let me be there to help them come true

Tell me your fears, when you feel afraid
Come to my arms let me rock them away

That's all I'll ever ask,
That's all I'll ever ask, That's all I'll ever ask
Of you

Come to my shoulder when you need to weep
Wake me up, when you cannot sleep

Talk to me, when you want to be heard
Be silent with me, when you can't say a word

That's all I'll ever ask, That's all I'll ever ask,
That's all I'll ever ask
Of you

I can't swear you'll never have to cry another tear
But when ever you want someone to hold you
I'm always right here

So just come to me for anything at all
Call my name, it's yours to call

Feel my faith in you when you can't find your own
And always remember you're never alone

That's all I'll ever ask, That's all I'll ever ask,
That's all I'll ever ask
Of you
