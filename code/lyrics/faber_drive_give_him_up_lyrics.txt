Song:

She's crying
On the phone
Everyday, it's the same
But she'll never know
He's lying,
He's not alone
At the bar, grinding hard,
With another ho

So wasted,
He stumbles in
Throws the keys on the couch,
Acting innocent,
She won't ask,
Where he's been,
Just wants a kiss from his lips,
Cause she misses him

All this time, it kills me

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink
She doesn't see that she should be with me
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him,
G-g-g-give him up

He wakes up
To go to work
Takes his keys, his cds
And a Gucci shirt
He's practised
And well rehearsed
Every line by design
In the mirror first,
She's dressed up
It's Friday night
Sitting home, all alone
Hoping he's alright,
He calls her,
He's working late
She's never thought that he's got,
Another dirty date

All this time,
All this time,
It kills me

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink
She doesn't see that she should be with me
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
She's gotta give him,
G-g-g-give him up

They say come what may,
But I can't seem to get you off my mind,
They say come what may,
But I can't let you fall for every line
They say come what may,
But I can't watch while you forgive him,
Everytime,
Everytime

This is the game that plays away,
He's gonna cheat
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink
She doesn't see that she should be with me,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up,
This is the game that plays away
He's gonna cheat
Night after night,
Another girl, another drink
She doesn't see that she should be with me,
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up
She's gotta give him, g-g-give him up
She's gotta give him,
G-g-g-give him up.
