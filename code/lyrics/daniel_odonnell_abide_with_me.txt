Song:

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, o abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'are
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be
Through cloud and sunshine o abide with me.

--- Instrumental ---

I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where grave thy victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.

Abide with me...
