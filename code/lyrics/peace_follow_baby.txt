Song:

I’m scared to die but maybe
A faithless bribe could save me
A touch, I bruise too easy
She stole the scene to see me

Her hair it bleeds and bleeds for you
As blood runs east
She’d lay the fees
And offers please she offers

Follow baby we gon live forever baby
Woke up deep deep deep deep

She’s scared to see, so humble
No food to eat we follow
But after sleep we’re to the
The forest field she said

Follow baby we gon live forever baby
Woke up deep deep deep deep
