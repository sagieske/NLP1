Song:

Whoa whoa... You you yeah.
Whoa whoa... Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Whoa!

Seen your picture.
Called your name.
Cover story teenage magazine.
Wish I could phone you.
Wish you well.
And tell our secrets like we used to tell.

My baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember.
Baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
Ummmmm

You're a star now.
Celebrity.
Have you forgotten how it used to be?
We'd play doctor
In the sand.
Do you remember back in childhood land?
Wish I could hold you
In my arms.
I miss your candy kisses and your charms.
Nobody loves you
The way I do.
I'll never find another girl like you.

My baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember.
Baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
Ummmmm

When I'm lonely,
I can hear your voice inside,
Inside, can't hide.
And when I look up
You're not anywhere.
I love you. You know it.
Wish that I could show it to
You you you.

My baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember.
Baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember.
Baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember.
Baby love.
Do you remember me?
My baby love.
I remember, you remember.

I remember, you remember.
Baby love. Do you remember me?

Baby love. Do you remember me?

I remember, you remember.

Baby love. Do you remember me?
My baby love. I remember.

Baby love. Do you remember me?
My baby love. I remember, you remember.

Baby love. Do you remember me?
My baby love. I remember.

Baby love. Do you remember me?
My baby love. I remember.

Baby love. Do you remember me?
My baby love.
