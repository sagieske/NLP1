Song:

Gather 'round, gather 'round, hurry
Uh, welcome! Uh, little boys and girls
Listen, I'm bout to lace yall motherfuckers
About Oakland, the City of Dope
The first place in the world to ever sell base rock
N***a, crack rock, they put it there to get rid
Of the Panthers, but they really created this ballin
What, what, n***a

Verse 1:

Me and my n****s trying to ride drop
Buy rocks then we buy blocks
From the same dope fiends on my block who buy rocks
Want supply hot
Weight servin cakes like ihop
Ever since them last motherfuckers got shot
Police been hot on my spot
Spot cops fbi watch
Got fiber-optic s**t up in the pole
Showing my whole clique on crime watch
We let non-stop and show our faces
So what the case is
We wide on tv but still the grind don't stop
N***a this Oakland, the city of dope
You know where that crack s**t was invented
And smoked by these ghetto chemists years ago
On Plymouth street we call the block
Plymouth Rock
The first place like the world to ever sell base rocks
Now check it,
The legendary Phoenix Mitchell put it down
So tough they had to make a movie about the town
But called it Nino Brown
That bullshit New Jack City
Is really based upon this place we call Crack City
Oakland, Cali we act shitty
Think crack's the answer
To get rid of these revolutionary Black Panthers
Smokin' blow and takin (???) like Jo-Jo Dancer
Or sniff it up your nose and ball out of control
Like Tony Montana
House in Atlanta
3-car garage
Our ghetto superstars was hard
Young n****s touch a mil-ticket
Before they life behind bars
N****s get caught with like eighty kilos
Hidden in the wall
But s**t ain't hidden at all
From these cocaine sniffin dogs
Same with the law
S**t in your draws when they get your a**
And let the ballers ball, get the cash
Till they get to your a**
I've never seen a baller fall on his knees
And snitch so fast
Plea bargain run after them n****s
That hang out with your a**
No wonder why that b***h-a** n***a got out
So quick, so fast
Came on the block my n****s saw you
Choppin' it up with task
Now that's a violation
N***a can't chop it up with task
So while the trial awaits
Some n***a walks up and pumped his a**
Because the n****s in the O are hard as f**k
We sell peruvian flake, get it powdered, or rocked up
Don't want nothin from life but to retire from the game
Motherfuckin city of cocaine,

City of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right
The city of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right

Verse 2:

Them task folks can't stop us
High school n****s get caught with a hundred G's
Stashed in his locker along with a chopper
N****s be ballin like a doctor, or a surgeon
M. C. Hammer splurgin'
He bought up countless brand new helicopters
And suburbans, now he hurtin
The feds spilled they base downtown
So now it's curtains
N****s be perpin' off
Certain it's gon' be a sweep
Dope feind came through last week
Told me it's gonna be a sweep
1991's the number n***a
End of the summer
N****s ain't ridin no fuckin hummers
We ride under buckets and try to stay on the slunder
I wonder, wonder what they would do
To a n***a who get caught with 2 pounds of thunder
Straight from Humboldt county, f**k that brown
Weed all should be green like the jungle
Dope fiends tryin to warn us
Settin' up scene still in a bundle
We beat they a** and drag them from they hair
Just like repunzel
Don't f**k up our hustle
But anyway the day came just as predicted
I'm up at 6 in the mornin' takin early morning pissin'
Pulled down my britches, and a n***a almost shitted
I heard somebody walkin on the roof
I cocked the for-fitness
Woke my cousin Mike up
Could be some n****s sent to strike us
Cause back then so many n****s didn't like us
Looked out the window, all I saw
Was fbi and snipers
I let the china white flush
And put that motherfucking 4-5 up
See the dope fiend he informed us
Told us it's gonna be a sweep and then
He tried to warn us
But n****s out here try to make they money
So we 'nourmous
Then only a battering ram
Bustin down your s**t, 'nourmous
Highway patrols, 5. 0's, ambulance and coroners
In case there was a shootout or high-speed chase performance
By 9: 00 they lock down each baller from every corner
From north to west on down to east Oakland California
But, but, them n****s from the O is hard as f**k
We sell Peruvian flake powder or get it rocked up
Want nothing in life but to retire from the game
With some change in the city of cocaine,

East Oakland, yeah that's right
City of dope
East Oakland, yeah that's right
City of dope
