Song:

There's a warm little home on a hill
And the presents that's hiding somewhere
And the world is so peaceful and still
You can almost hear love in the air

There's a blanket of snow on the ground
And a bright little star in the sky
And your heart knows that Santa is around
By the twinkle in everyone's eye

There's gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir

There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill

There is gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir

There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill
