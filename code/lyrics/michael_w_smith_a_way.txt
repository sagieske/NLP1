Song:

Caught in a dream of where I want to be wrapped in a web of where I am
I feel a wall between what is and what should be
You find me waiting for a miracle You hear me praying for a plan
You are the only one prepared to rescue me

Then You take away the distance found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
Whoa, hide me in the heaven You have held within your hand
And make a way to find a way to soothe my mind

There is a way that might seem right to me
A dim reflection of what's good just an illusion of the best that I can be
But there's another path You offer me I wish I always understood
Some way You see right through my thoughts and know my needs

Then You take away the distance found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
Whoa, hide me in the heaven You have held within your hand
And make a way to find a way to soothe my mind
Please come soothe my mind

You alway take away the distance found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
And You hide me in the heaven You have held within your hand
You always make a way to find a way to soothe my mind

Yeah, You take away the distance found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
And You hide me in the heaven You have held within your hand
You always make a way to find a way to soothe my mind

Yeah, You take away the distance found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
And You hide me in the heaven You have held within your hand
You always make a way to find a way to soothe my mind
