Song:

If you close the door
Just turn off the lights now
The world looks better into the dark
Between the curtains somebody's watching
Oh sail me the moon
Before it's too late

Don't kiss me goodbye baby

I turn around since too much time
Those railroad tracks
Will swallow my mind
I try so hard to stop wasting my life
If only I could just make you mine

Don't kiss me goodbye
