[Intro:]
(Oh, oh)
I'm bout to pull over, and give you the business holla at me
(Ooooh)
Can I get a witness?
Now here we go
Mmmm-mmm-mmm
Now here we go
Mmmm-mmm-mmm

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Baby, I've been waitin for you to come home
Cuz I done cleared off the backseat, cleaned the top and out some new 24s on the??
Latley I've been waitin to try somethin new
Cuz we done did every last one of your fantasies
But we aint did nothin I wanna do
Cuz we done did in in the elevator (been there done that)
Now it's time to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pullin your hair, won't even compare to what I'm about to do to you on this highway

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm talkin bout that backseat action (oh)
Out in the middle of the traffic (oh)
I'm bout to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me, (oooh) can I get a witness?
Now here we go

[Hook: Shawnna (T-Pain)]
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go (here we go)
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Shawty, you can call me whenever you need
Workin in the Excursion, kissin in the Expedition like yes indeed
Baby, it's all gravy; it's all good
Cuz we gon' need to open up the backdoor and let your legs out
Or I'm-a put you right on the hood
I've been down like an elevator (been there done that)
I know you like to do it my way (I know you want that)
And pullin your hair, won't even compare to what I'm about to do to you on this highway

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm talkin bout that backseat action (oh)
Out in the middle of the traffic (oh)
I'm bout to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me, (oooh) can I get a witness?
Now here we go

[Hook: Shawnna (T-Pain)]
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go (here we go)
Here we go, back and forth, (mmmm) break it down, or take it slow (mmmm)
Take control, make it roll, (mmmm) break it down, now here we go

[Verse 3: Shawnna]
Face down, a** up, that's the way I like it rough
Cloud it up, back it up, driver's seat to the passenger
Back to the back, all in the act
Smack, smack, smack, smack
Shawnna like that that??
Hands on the window, foot on the wheel
Face in the seat, wait for the beat
Rockin and rockin makin in squeek
Stop, stop, stop, stop
What you gon' do? Somebody might see
So make it fast, take it slow
Break it down and make it roll
Take control, make it swoll
Now one more time, here we go

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm talkin bout that backseat action (oh)
Out in the middle of the traffic (oh)
I'm bout to pull over, and give you the business
Holla at me, (oooh) can I get a witness?
Now here we go
