Song:

Hey world stand up
Stretch out your hands
One8 represent the dream
Africa
Feel free
One8 let's get them

I'm reaching out to the poor people
The sick and the alone
I'm reaching out to the fortunate who can build their own homes
I'm reaching out to the ones who seems to have lost their way
And I'm calling on all the ones who can show them a brighter day
I believe if you believe then we can achieve anything
So lift your voice and give it everything
Now let you're your heart sing

Chorus:
Africa to America
Everywhere common and spread some love
We got faith and a little hope
I believe that we can heal the globe
It's time to open our eyes and see
That all we need is you and me
Unity's like harmony
So let me see you stretch your hands across the world
Hands across the world... 

I'm reaching out to all of the hoods and the streets everywhere
I'm reaching out to all in need to show the world that you care
Can't go no more you've given up and your energy's running low
I'm reaching out to the pastors and the words they give us all
I believe that if you believe then we can achieve anything
So lift your voice and give it everything
Now let you're your heart sing

Chorus:
Africa to America
Everywhere common and spread some love
We got faith and a little hope
I believe that we can heal the globe
It's time to open our eyes and see
That all we need is you and me
Unity's like harmony
So let me see you stretch your hands across the world
Hands across the world... 

It's the world main project my desire
The power of love you cannot deny ya
Let's go people it's time to go higher
Let's spread your wings I believe you can fly ya
We can do anything if we believe
Let me see you dance if you got victory
If we come together we can make history
So let me see you reach

[Chorus: X 2]
Africa to America
Everywhere common and spread some love
We got faith and a little hope
I believe that we can heal the globe
It's time to open our eyes and see
All we need is you and me
Unity's like harmony
So let me see you stretch your hands across the world
Hands across the world

Cross the World
