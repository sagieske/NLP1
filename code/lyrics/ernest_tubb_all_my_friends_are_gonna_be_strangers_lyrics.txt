Song:

All the love you promised would be mine forever I would have bet my bottom dollar on
Well it sure turned out to be a short forever
Just once I turned my back and you were gone
From now on all my friends are gonna be strangers I'm all through ever trusting anyone
The only thing I can count on now is my fingers
I was a fool believing you and now you are gone
[ guitar ]
It amazes me not knowing any better than to think I had a love that would be true
Why I should be taken out tired and feathered to have let myself be taken in by you
From now on all my friends...
