Song:

Run, run, run
Like ya never did run before
Give ‘em the chill
With the certified give me more
Ain't no use in plugging in the daily grind
We can push out more than we can even find
Nobody looks so good as with a burst of the fire
Give ‘em what they looking for.

It's a G-D M-F
Blood filled station
I'm a G-D-M-M
No pacification
C'mon now
Smile and die.
This ain't more than a moment in time
So, I fire.
Give ‘em what they looking for.
Armory, armory
I'm a one man army, I'm a warring nation.
Armory, armory
Armory, armory
I'm the swift cold hand of retaliation
Armory, armory.

Fight, fight, fight
Like ya never did fight before
Brokenhearted b******s rotten down to the core
I can find you when you seem to disappear
I can make it like you never were even here
I can rag-doll the beat, dance in the fire.
Give ‘em what they looking for.

It's a G-D M-F
Blood filled station
I'm a G-D-M-M
No pacification
C'mon now
Smile and die.
This ain't more than a moment in time
So, I fire.
Give ‘em what they looking for.
Armory, armory
I'm a one man army, I'm a warring nation.
Armory, armory
Armory, armory
I'm the swift cold hand of retaliation
Armory, armory.

No time for monkey bizness,
Got no time to fail
Got no time for, yeah, forgiveness,
Never do turn tail.
The sun will shine down on the crest of my armory
On the day I put to rest the heart of my enemy.
I got no time. (I got no time)
I got no time. (I got no time)

Armory, armory
I'm a one man army, I'm a warring nation.
Armory, armory
Armory, armory
I'm the swift cold hand of retaliation
Armory, armory.
Fight, fight, fight
Like ya never did fight before
