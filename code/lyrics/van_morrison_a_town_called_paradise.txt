Song:

Copycats ripped off my words
Copycats ripped off my songs
Copycats ripped off my melody
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you

Gonna take you out
Get you in my car
Were going for a long long drive
Were going down to a town called paradise
Down where we can be free
Were gonna drink that wine
Were gonna jump for joy
In a town called paradise

Were going up the mountainside
Child you can look for miles
And see the vision on the west
Were gonna swing round
And look from north to south
Swing round from east to west
And go round in a circle too
And were gonna start dancing
Like weve never done before
I'm gonna take you in my arms
I'm gonna squeeze you tight
Everything will be alright
Were gonna get that squealin feelin
Gonna take you down to a town called paradise,
Down where we can be free
It doesn't matter what they say
It doesn't matter what they do
All that matters is my relationship to you
By the river we will linger
As we drive down to be free
Were gonna ride all night long
All along the ancient highway
Gonna be there for the mornin comes
