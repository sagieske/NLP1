Song:

The hurt in your eyes will never disguise the sparkle lived there before
And I know that there is so much more
Than you're showin'
The clouds in your head will bring it in tears but I will catch every drop
Even if it don't ever stop
Cause you're worth it, worth it
When you fight for every breath
And the waves are overhand
Let me lay your mind to rest

[Chorus:]
I will stand by you
When all of your dreams are shattered
And your world is left in tatters
When you're lost we're lost together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
If black is your brightest colors
If hurt is your only lover
When you fight, we fight together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
The war in your head will shoot you down dead
So don't even try to win
Is it worth it all in the end
I don't think so
Try to embrace the lines on your face
The story of who you are
Cause I love what I've read so far
I mean it, I mean it
When you fight for every breath
And the waves are overhand
Let me lay your mind to rest

[Chorus:]
I will stand by you
When all of your dreams are shattered
And your world is left in tatters
When you're lost we're lost together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
If black is your brightest colors
If hurt is your only lover
When you fight, we fight together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
When you fight for every breath
And the waves are over head
Let me lay your mind to rest

[Chorus:]
I will stand by you
When all of your dreams are shattered
And your world is left in tatters
When you're lost we're lost together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
If black is your brightest colors
If hurt is your only lover
When you fight, we fight together
I'll stand by, I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
I will stand by you
