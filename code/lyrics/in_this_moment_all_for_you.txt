Song:

The seasons come and go
Another night another show
I step into the lights
Knowing we will be alright

Even when I'm far
You know I'm always there with you
And through this all

You know that you're the reason
In everything I do
It's all for you
You know that you're my reason in life
It's all for you

These faces come and go
And all I do is think of you
I'm on the long road home
The road that leads me straight to you

I know it's hard
I promise you we'll be alright
And through this all

You know that you're the reason
In everything I do
It's all for you
You know that you're my reason in life
It's all for you
