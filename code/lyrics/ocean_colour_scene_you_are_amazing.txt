Song:

You are amazing
It's the truth
And it's often fading
Without you

I don't feel the wind blow
I don't feel the hard rock
I don't feel it when it breaks your heart
I don't feel it all day [?]
To for? ?? Start

You are a lady
It's the truth
And it's often shady
Behind you

I don't feel the hollow
I don't feel it all grow/broke
I don't believe it when you make your mark
I don't live in malice
I need more than that (?? ?)

Standing here in hollow
It's the only thing broke
And it shakes you and it makes you start
Like a singing widow/willow which will mend your heart

You are amazing
It's the truth
