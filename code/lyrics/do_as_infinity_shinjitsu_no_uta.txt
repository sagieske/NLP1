Song:

"the crimson-stained sun
Has illuminated everything; now and the past
Is what I have imagined within this twilight
More than my own hands can accomplish?
Please teach me how to live
A little more vulnerably than I do now
Won't you taint me just a little?
That way, even if I get hurt
And lose everything around me
This song of truth will flow through my heart
This dispute will probably go on
About that which is most precious
I've become a rebel, I've overlooked things
Even the gentle smiles of strangers
If eternity knows what manner of darkness
And when pain will vanish,
Then that way, you shall taint me
I looked always to yesterday, to the castles in the sky
When will I be able to follow them?
This song of truth shall be my guide
If eternity knows what manner of darkness
And when pain will vanish,
This song of truth will flow through my heart
Now, please, taint me just a little
Please, just taint me, only a little
This song of truth shall be my guide"
