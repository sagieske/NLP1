Song:

You're my best friend, 
But then you died, 
When I was 23 and you were 25
You're my best friend, 
But then you died, 
And how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?
Oh how will I survive, survive, survive, survive?

And every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the top of your car, 
Every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the hood of your car, 

Ah oh... 

I had a dream of you, 
You were drifting away, 
You were sad, 
You always would drift away, 
And I know you're going to be okay, 
Cos I can see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, 
And I know I wanna survive, survive, survive, survive

And every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the top of your car, 
Every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the hood of your car, 

Ah oh... 

And every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the top of your car, 
Every day, I waited for you, 
And every day, on the hood of your car, 

Ah oh...
