Song:

Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the floor! 
I can't imagine you with no heels on, 
You took your time, I like your girlfriend... 
Whipping your hip back and forth
Cause you know how it sounds, 
Is this your favorite sound?
No one is going home alone cause:

Chorus:
... so amazing, 
I just need a volunteer, 
Go, go, go, go! 
Now ladies:
Arch ya back, you better arch ya back! 
Arch ya back, you better arch ya back! 
Arch ya back, arch ya back! 
You better arch ya back! 

She's walking in the heels like she's on a runway, 
... that I'm adequate.
You pushed me on the stairs, fall is a killer scene, 
Tell your girl to come and make sandwich... in between.
Slow, slow, slow, slow, 
She's dancing like Beyonc–π with them freaking heels on! 
It's so hot cause... like three to one, 
Let's be honest she's hot, 

Chorus:
... so amazing, 
I just need a volunteer, 
Go, go, go, go! 
Now ladies:
Arch ya back, you better arch ya back! 
Arch ya back, you better arch ya back! 
Arch ya back, arch ya back! 
You better arch ya back
