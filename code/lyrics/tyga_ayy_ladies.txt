(Tyga Ft. Travis Porter)

Ok now ladies (Yeah)
If you know you bad (Yeah)
Don't need no man, got yo own bands, put up yo hands
If you a top notch b***h let me hear you holler
Bend it over (Yeah), Touch ya toes, whip it out (Yeah) show them hoes ya bank roll
Slang it out, hit a broke ho with it
Poke it out, Damn Shawty you can get it

Ah, 1234 give a booty 5
I like my b*****s real thick lil mo' thighs
Richer than ya old head n***a no lie
Stacks in the p***y hole, call that the g spot
Real gentlemen, f**k and never call again
I'm hot, fresh up out that water, & I ain't even swim
Heard she got a n***a, well he could be a man
Man I wouldn't shake his hand with a broke hand
I don't fear 'nem n***a, boy Conan
Make a b***h strip butt naked like she pole dance
Standing in the club on a, on a couch s**t
Grab the mic then announce this...

Ok now ladies (Yeah)
If you know you bad (Yeah)
Don't need no man, got yo own bands, put up yo hands
If you a top notch b***h let me hear you holler
Bend it over (Yeah), Touch ya toes, whip it out (Yeah) show them hoes ya bank roll
Slang it out, hit a broke ho with it
Poke it out, Damn Shawty you can get it

Man I get it, man I get it, get it in for real
She ain't with it I ain't tripping got one at the crib
Planking on the Maybach this is how I live
Give a b***h banana d**k then I make her do the split
Heard you was a trick, trick them b*****s you a pimp
Man that b***h simple, you ain't gotta sip
I'm flyer than a blimp fly how she getting hit
Wide body Benz, Roseanne on the whip
No tan, but that heat sun burn a b***h
N****are straight snitching, report like journalist
Hey I'm on my s**t, like horses is
Grab a friend then tell her this...

Ok now ladies (Yeah)
If you know you bad (Yeah)
Don't need no man, got yo own bands, put up yo hands
If you a top notch b***h let me hear you holler
Bend it over (Yeah), Touch ya toes, whip it out (Yeah) show them hoes ya bank roll
Slang it out, hit a broke ho with it
Poke it out, Damn Shawty you can get it
