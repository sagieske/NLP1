Song:

Just an outline made of skin
And my walls are paper thin
I want to let you color me in

Feel like I'm drowning from the sound
Of all the silence all around
My thoughts are gone
I'm going down
I'm turning inside out

This time I finally need a light, a light
Tired of seeing in black and white, white

Having flashes in my mind
Can't take the ticking of time
The time that's passing by

This time I finally need a light, a light
Tired of seeing in black and white, white

Having flashes in my mind
Can't take the ticking of time
The time that's passing by

This time I finally need a light, a light
Tired of seeing in black and white, white

Having flashes in my mind
Can't take the ticking of time
The time that's passing by
