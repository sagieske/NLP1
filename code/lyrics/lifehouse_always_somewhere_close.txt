Song:

You take the weight
You take it all
You can take everything
I'm feeling so tight and for so long
I need you now
I need you next to me

[Chorus:]
It doesn't matter where you go
You still a part of me
I don't know much but I know
You always somewhere
I'm telling you from the heart
You know I love you most
If I break or fall apart
You always somewhere close

And I can't wake up from falling down
And I can be hard on me
But in the end, I'm back again
You never too far
From knowing where we are yeah

[Chorus:]
It doesn't matter where you go
You still a part of me
I don't know much but I know
You always somewhere
I'm telling you from the heart
You know I love you most
If I break or fall apart
You always somewhere close

Whenever I feel lost and all alone
You always somewhere close

I'm telling you from the heart
You know I love you most
If I break or fall apart
You always somewhere close(x4)
