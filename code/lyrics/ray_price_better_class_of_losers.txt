(Harlan Howard - Ron Peterson)
I said I'm through with honky tonks they only bring me down
So I dressed my best and headed for the brightest spot in town
I've watched the rich folks come and go and one thing's very clear
There's just as many lonely people here.
I'm just hanging round a better class of losers
It don't matter if you drink beer or champagne
I've only found a better class of losers
Uptown, downtown, misery's all the same.
It's all been downhill for me since baby walked away
I'm down here at the bottom and I guess that's where I'll stay
I'm a looking for an answer but all that I've seen here
Is the same old lonely, phoney atmosphere.
I'm just hanging round a better class of losers
It don't matter if you drink beer or champagne
I've only found a better class of losers
Uptown, downtown, misery's all the same.
Uptown, downtown, misery's all the same...
