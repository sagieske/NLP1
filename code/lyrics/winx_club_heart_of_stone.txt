Song:

I've tried to understand you
But you're still a mystery
Sometimes I feel you close
And sometimes we're miles away
I wish I knew the secret
To reach your heart 'cause lately
You've got me feeling so alone

One day you took me up
And the next day you will bring me down
Stop playing with my feelings
I'm about to lose my mind
Just put your arms around me
Why can't you say you love me
And I can't take this anymore

[Chorus:]
I've had enough of rainy days
Just say you're sorry it's to late
My life has just begun
I'll be okay
That's why I'm walking out the door
Who could love a heart of stone?
It's me, myself and I
I'll be just fine
This is my chance to shine
So say goodbye

You take my life for granted
I've been waiting for too long
For you to say these three words:
Baby, open up your heart
You'll see what I've been missing
Give me a reason to stay
Or I won't have to let you go

[Chorus:]

[Chorus:]
