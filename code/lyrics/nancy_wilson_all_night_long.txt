Song:

Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's every dream I dream
All night long

Never heard him say a single word of love
Don't know his fate or his soul
'Cause he only speaks to me in dreams I've dreamed
All night long

When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no

I don't wanna love that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so warm?

Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long

When I sleep he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best my dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand he'll disappear, no no no

I don't wanna love that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so warm?
Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long

Now, I've got to find the man who's haunting me
All night long
All night long
All night long
