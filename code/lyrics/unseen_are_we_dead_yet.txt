Song:

There's a heat down on the street
And it's radiating through my feet
There will be trouble in Allston tonight
There's a kid with a silent shout
'Cause he's livin' off of hand to mouth
Hey generation, I'm talkin' to You

Are we dead yet?

Street lamps flicker and the young wolves wail
As the vultures drag another off to jail
We would've been dead 20 years ago
Do you think they really care about you?
No way

How's this for an answer?
F**k you
