Song:

It just happened
On an ordinary day
I looked so foward to hearing you sing!
But I thought why
Am I so glad to see you
Everyday!

I think I'm Falling In love with you!
It's the only way to say
I think I'm falling in love with you!

Is there such thing as perfection
Cause when I look at you I see it
How you sing
So seren and calm
How you smile
Everyday
The only way to say

I think I'm falling in love with you!
It's the only way to say
I think I'm falling in love with you!

The only way
To say!
I'm falling in love with you!

The way you sing
The way you smile
The way you dance
It makes me smile

You're the only thing that makes me smile
Because I'm falling in love with you!

Love with you!
