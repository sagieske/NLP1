Song:

Whenever I buy a lighter in the store
You take it away
I cannot find the ashtray anymore
Did you take it away?
Smoking is not good for me
It damages my health
If you don't give me nicotine
Well, then I ask someone else
And you say
What you do
Is just the way that I wanted you to
And you say
What you see
Is not the way that you want me to be
Whenever I pour myself a glass of wine
You take it away
The bottle I bought today I cannot find
Did you take it away?
Drinking is not good for me
It damages my brain
I haven't had a single drop
And it's driving me insane!
Whenever I get some change from anywhere
You take it away
I'm loving my little bankbook - you don't care
You take it away
Money is not good for me
It damages my soul
You take away my piggy bank
And dig it in a hole
And you say
What you do
Is just the way that I wanted you to
And you say
What you see
Is not the way that you want me to be
