Q-tip:

Just feelin things out for real, ya know?
Just wanna do me for real, ya know?
No reason to make it complicated, you feelin agitated,
You love it or you hate it...fuck it
Desperation, jumpin off of street corners here
Hustlahz lookin for buzz like pop one in here
Local state officials....yeah they out of touch
Getting money for some, aiyo, aint nothin much
But yo...let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it
You don't understand, so don't tell it
You sneakin souls just for phat diamond golds
Cuz our lady friends have likings for designer clothes
People in my hood think....if Im lookin raggedy, then the cat is just a weak
Link
In the very fake chain of oppression....if television taught me any lesson, its
Image is nothing, but yo I got a thirst...nothing, but yo I got a thirst
Nothing, but yo I got a thirst...what's first? your rings or your purse?

Jonathan davis (korn):

(oh boy...oh boy! make your wagers back there! step lively...women and
Children first! the world is coming to an end! come on now...were looking at
The end!we have to leave them...we have to leave all our paraphanelias
Behind....{brought back...brought back....[repeated]} lets gooooo!)

Its kinda scary you see....
How fucked up things can be
Each time you take a bath
How it could have been your last
There's so much shit around us
Things we can't even see
Is this the end of our line?
That's where I wanna be....that's where I wanna be
That's where I want to be....that's where-i want-to be

(end of time)-repeated
(brought back...)-repeated
