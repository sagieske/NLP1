Song:

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
Wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the tail lights shining through the window pane

He said I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
She said you're a ramblin man, 
You ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame, 
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln, 
The night as black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress eyes he sees that same old light is shinin'
And he thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
She said you're a ramblin man, 
You ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame, 
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

Well it's a windin' road, 
When you're in the lost and found
Your a lover, I'm a runner
And we go round and round
And I love you but I leave you, 
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here babyyy

Ohhh, I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
Cause I'm a ramblin man, 
(I ain't ever gonna change)
I ain't ever gonna change
Got a gypsy soul to blame, 
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you, 
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines

I'm with your ghost again, 
It's a shame about the weather, 
I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait till then
(I can't wait till then)
