Song:

Out of this world

Out of this world

(April Start)
Your smile gets me every single time I see you
Your eyes take me away
I don't really know what this is gonna lead to
But it's like I'm floating in space

(Both)
You take me somewhere that I've never been before
There's a whole new place waitin'
When you open up the door

You're out of this world
I knew that you could make it
You didn't have to fake it
You're never coming down
You're out of this world
You can't get any better
We're gonna last forever
Keep your head up don't look down

You're out of this world (out of this world)
Out of this world
Yeah, you're out of this world
Out of this world (out of this world)

(Proto Zoa)
The stars, like diamonds, above our heads are fallin'
I know that wishes come true
Your voice, across the universe you were callin'
Like a song from out of the blue

(Both)
We're flyin' so high
We're almost at the top
And as long as we're together
I never wanna stop

You're out of this world
I knew that you could make it
You didn't have to fake it
You're never coming down
You're out of this world
You can't get any better
We're gonna last forever
Keep your head up don't look down

You're out of this world (out of this world)
Out of this world (Oh Yeah)
You're out of this world
Out of this world (out of this world)

(April Start)
So many dreams to fly to
And I'll be right beside you
We're getting closer to the sun
(Proto Zoa)
They're shining
(April Start)
We'll let the moon astound us
A million stars surround us
(Both)
Wishing on each one

You're out of this world
You can't get any better
We're gonna last forever
Keep your head up don't look down

You're out of this world
I knew that you could make it
You didn't have to fake it
You're never coming down
You're out of this world
You can't get any better
We're gonna last forever
Keep your head up don't look down

You're out of this world (out of this world)
Out of this world
Out of this world
Out of this world (out of this world)

You're out of this world (out of this world)
Out of this world (Oh Yeah)
You're out of this world
Out of this world (out of this world)

Ohhhhhh

You're out of this world, Oh yeah
