Song:

I Don't Want No Cake On My Birthday, I Want My Cake Errday [x4]

I Gone Be Honest Tomorrow Ain't Promised that's Why I Say This
Here Today Then You Gone Like Rentin A Car From Avis
Hurts But it's The Truth You?? Out That Mercedes
That's Why I Be On Point, I'm Never Procastinatin
You Better Be Dodgin Saten, That p***y n***a Be Hatin
Want His Cake And Eat It Too
Then Do You Greasy Like Bacon
Everyday Money Chasin
I'm So In Love With The Fragrance
So What I'm A Little Impatient
Dope man Ain't Got No Patience
I'm Actin Like I'm Racin
Before I Become A Rasin
Strippers Hotter Then Cajan
My Deli? Be In Rotation
The Daily Birthday Occasion
I'm Rarely Off Of Vacation
I'm Rarely Out Of The Nation
And Nelly Dollars In Rakin'?

I Don't Want No Cake On My Birthday, I Want My Cake Errday [x4]

I Ain't Talkin Next Year
I Ain't Taklin In A Month
I Ain't Talkin In A Week
Every Day I Wanna Stunt
Every Day I Want Sum Candles
Every Day A Hundred Bones
Every Day I Pull Up In Lambos, Fillet Mion For Lunch
What My Birthday
You Got My Birthday
When My Birthday
You Better Say My Birthday
I Get Emotional
That's What C Notes Will Do
Them Penny Lofer Shoes Help Me Cop A Bentley Coupe
Now My String Of Wemen Hotter Than Campbell's Soup
Boy That Cake Will Make Them Peps Turn To Animals
I'm King Kong And it's Your Trainin Day
Denzel With The Ice And I'm Pushin Weight
I Ain't Tryin Wake Em All

I Aint Tryin To Down Pay
But Biggie Got A Wife She Ain't With Him Not A Day
Ain't No Body Here To Stay
You Can Try And Get Away
I'll [? ] Prey
My Advice Still The Same

I Don't Want No Cake On My Birthday, I Want My Cake Errday [x4]
