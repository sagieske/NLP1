Song:

Are you in it for love
Are you in it for money
If I lost everything would you be there in the morning

Ay mama, you're my sweet mamacita
You've gonne to my head, like too many margaritas
You say that you sing, that you're some kind of dancer
But the stars in your eyes, never reveal the answer
One fine day, you'll be walking out that door
I hope you find, just what you're looking for

Are you in it for love
Are you in it for money
If I lost everything would you be there in the morning
Are you in it for kicks
Private jets and Armani
When the ride's over, would you even bother to call me

Ay mama, you're my sweet se—Åorita
But if I should fall in love, will of your sweetness turn bitter
You swear that you'll stay, that you love me forever
But that's what you'll say to the next fool who's handsome or clever
One fine day, when your name is up in light
You will know what I am asking you tonight

Are you in it for love
Are you in it for money
If I lost everything would you be there in the morning
Are you in it for kicks
Private jets and Armani
When the ride's over, would you even bother to call me

Are you in it for money cause to much is never enough
Are you in it for you, Are you in it for me
Are you in it for love.

Are you in it for you, Are you in it for me

Are you in it for love
Are you in it for money
If I lost everything would you be there in the morning
Are you in it for kicks
Private jets and Armani
When the ride's over, would you even bother to call me

Are you in it for love
Are you in it for money
If I lost everything would you be there in the morning
Are you in it for kicks
Private jets and Armani
When the ride's over, would you even bother to call me
