Song:

Tears of rain run down my window pane
I'm on my own again good evening sorrow
Sit and dream of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes I get the strangest feeling

Knock knock who's there
Could this be love that's calling
The door is always open wide
Knock knock who's there
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

Climb the stair and then I say a prayer
For someone who could share my situation
But instead as I lay down my head
I have to leave it all to my imagination

Knock knock who's there
Could this be love that's calling
The door is always open wide
Knock knock who's there
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la

Sit and dream of how things might have been
And as I close my eyes
I get the strangest feeling

Knock knock who's there
Could this be love that's calling
The door is always open wide
Knock knock who's there
Now as the night is falling
Take off your coat and come inside
Take off your coat and come inside
