Song:

It's all in the way
That you call out my name
In the night just to say
That you love me, baby

It's all in the way
That you touch and erase me
Makes me go crazy
I'm in love

I'm here for you
You're here for me
Simple as it seems
Because my love

Will listen be the truth
The good in me is you
And if you need some proof
Just look in my eyes and I'll tell you one more time

It's all in the way
That you call out my name
In the night just to say
That you love me, baby

It's all in the way
That you touch and erase me
It makes me go crazy
I'm in love

Let me break it down clearly
Babe, if for some reason can't feel me
Let me tune you into my life
'Cause if you understand what you do to me
You'll never have a reason to leave
Baby, don't you know

It's you, me
All about real love
It's all in the way, you, me
All about real love

My thoughts are replaced by your lovely face
And the spirit that you bring I just can't erase
The love that we have is like Amazing Grace
How sweet it is in your way

My thoughts are replaced by your lovely face
And the spirit that you bring I just can't erase
The love that we have is like Amazing Grace
How sweet it is in your way

You got my lovin' in the way
My heart and soul in the way
My love unfolds in the way
Look into my eyes and I'll tell you one more time

It's all in the way
That you call out my name
In the night just to say
That you love me, baby

It's all in the way
That you touch and erase me
Makes me go crazy
I'm in love

My thoughts are replaced by your lovely face
And the spirit that you bring I just can't erase
The love that we have is like Amazing Grace
How sweet it is in your way

My thoughts are replaced by your lovely face
And the spirit that you bring I just can't erase
The love that we have is like Amazing Grace
How sweet it is

It's you, me
All about real love
It's all in the way, you, me
All about real love

It's all in the way

Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
