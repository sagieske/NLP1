Song:

I focus on my dreaming in many ways
Rain's been falling for seven days
The earth is wet like my heart
I haven't found time to dry it yet
Sun is hiding
So I run
I run to find satisfaction
You go away...

I wanna say there is no other way
Then dreaming for a cool destiny
Rain's been dripping for seven days
The earth is wet have no time, to dry it yet
Sun is hiding
So I run
I run to find satisfaction

I focus on my dreaming in many ways
Rain's been falling for seven days
I haven't found time to dry it yet
Sun is hiding
So I run
I run to find satisfaction
