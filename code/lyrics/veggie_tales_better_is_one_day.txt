Song:

How lovely is Your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty
My soul longs and even faints for You, for You
For here my heart is satisfied within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wing

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Than thousands elsewhere

One thing I ask and I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Than thousands elsewhere

My heart and flesh cry out
To You, the living God
Your spirit's water for my soul

I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you, to you

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere

Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Than thousands elsewhere
Than thousands elsewhere

I love that song, yeah, it's a really good idea
To take a bible verse and turn it into song
It helps you to remember it

Psalm 1: 19 says that remembering
Or hiding God's word in your heart is really important
Because it shows us the way like a light on a dark path
So we never have to be afraid, right Bob?
Because God is always with us
