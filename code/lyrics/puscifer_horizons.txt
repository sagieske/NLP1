Song:

Horizons
Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash and urn and silence
Talk to me
Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway
Without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
About you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this silent
Horizon

Dust devil swept you away
It's still not real
Ash and urn and silence

Dust devil swept you away
My recollections are all that's left of you
Swirl and sway without me

Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this silent
Horizon

Swirl and sway without me
Dust devil swept you away
Whirling playful dancing
About you
What's left of you is
Ash and urn in this
Silent
