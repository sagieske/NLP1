Song:

Am I real,
Do the words I speak before you make you feel
That the love I have for you will see no ending
But if you look inside my eyes then you should know
That there is nothing here to doubt
Nothing to fear
And you can lay your questions down
Cause if you'll hold me we can fade into the night
And you'll know

The world could die
And everything may lie
Still you couldn't cry
Cause time may pass
But longer than it'll last
I'll be by your side
Forever by your side

Take my hand and gently close your eyes
So you could understand
That there's no greater love tonight
Than what live for you
Well if you feel the same way for me then let go
We can journey to the garden no one knows
Life is short my darling
Tell me that you love me
So we can fade into the night than you'll know

The world could die
And everything may lie
Still couldn't cry
Cause time could die
And everything may lie
Still couldn't cry

Cause time may pass
Ang everything won't last
I'll be by your side
Forever by your side

So you won't cry
So you won't cry
If you won't cry
