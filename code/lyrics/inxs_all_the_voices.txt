Song:

Deep down in my heart
There is a lot of words
Tears fall down my face
But I hear the many voices that cry in pain

I wanna tell you
Don't give it up
I wanna tell you
Don't give it up

Hear the voices
That surround you
All the people
Never doubt it

Hear the voices
Take a look at what surrounds you
All the people
We can change things never doubt it

We won't take new start
Is it just too much to ask
What does it take
Cause I hear a million people singing the same

I wanna tell you
Don't give it up
I wanna tell you
Don't give it

Hear the voices
That surround you
All the people
Never doubt it
Hear the voices
Take a look at what surrounds you
All the people
We can change things never doubt it

We can change it
We can change it

Hear the voices
All the people
[repeat till fade]
