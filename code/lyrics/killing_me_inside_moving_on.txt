Lyrics by (Onadio)
Music by Josaphat

When we think about this I just cannot take it
Everybody know that I can make it

(I just Can't wait)

(Give me some air)

We'll never give up to get the star until we're Down

Reff:
This blood will be on that way (Together)
You know we made something here Tonight
This Life will be on that way (Forever)
This time Is Right we're moving on

Don't Give Up we can't go down
Everybody can't take it

(I just Can't wait)

(Give me some air)

We'll never give up to get the star until we're Down

Reff:
This blood will be on that way (Together)
You know we made something here tonight
This Life will be on that way (Forever)
This time Is Right we're moving on

I'll make it, I'll leave it now, I'll make it, I'll let this go
