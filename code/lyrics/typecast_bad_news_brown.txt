Verse 1:
You're making this hard for me
I'm cleaning the mess I'm in

Pre-Chorus:
Please don't pretend
Cause you're just the same like me

Chorus
What did those angry stares mean?
I don't understand
You told me that I've changed
But I haven't and you're still here

Verse 2:
In my heart since you've been gone
I always think about you

Pre-Chorus 2:
Now you're back I don't know what to do
I know we can never be
And I know it but
I don't want to believe
