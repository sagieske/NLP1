Song:

One, two, three!
Here we go!
Bedlam, bedlam!
Ho, ho, ho!

*Sung in background all the way through*: Ring ding ding, rum bum bum, riki tiki daba daba dum bum bum

Knock, knock, knock!
Come right in!
You? Re the people from the looney bin!

How? D you guys get here so soon?
Did you spot my toy balloon?

Please don? T make the straps too snug.
I? Ve always been a fragile bug.

Must we march?
Can? T we ride?
I? Ve got my horse parked right outside.

Glad to see that we? Re on time
But must you always speak in rhyme?

Lock the door and hide the key,
? Cause if I get loose, you won? T catch me

*Panting from ring ding dinger*
