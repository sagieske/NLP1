Song:

Am I real?
Do the words I speak before you
Make you feel
That the love I leave for you
Will see no ending?

Well, if you look into my eyes
Then you should know
That there is nothing here to doubt
Nothing to fear
And you can lay your questions down
'Cause if you'll hold me
We can fade into the night
And you'll know

The world could die
And everything may lie
Still you shouldn't cry
'Cause time may pass
But longer than it'll last
I'll be by your side

Take my hand
And gently close your eyes
So you could understand
That there's no greater love tonight
Than what I've for you
Well, if you feel the same way for me
Then let go

We can journey to a garden no one knows
Life is short, my darling
Tell me that you love me

So we can fade into the night
And you'll know
The world could die
And everything may lie
Still you shouldn't cry
'Cause time may pass
But longer than it'll last
I'll be by your side
Forever by your side...

I want you to know...
The world could lie,
And everything may die,
Still you shouldn't cry
'Cause time may pass
And everything won't last
I'll be by your side
Forever by your side...
Forever by your side...
So you won't cry...
