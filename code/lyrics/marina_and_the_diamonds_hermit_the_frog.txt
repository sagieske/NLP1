Song:

Yeah I feel I'm watered Down
Whenever he's around
I put on the crown of clowns
And melt slowly to the ground

Yeah I feel it coming on
When I've been static for too long
And an explosion comes in time
Before I go and cross the line
Oh yeah, I go and cross the line

They say you used to be so kind
I never knew you had such a dirty mind
Well, I went to the doctors believing
The devil had control over me
I was finding it hard to breath and
Finding it hard to fight the feeling

That my heart just burst like a glass balloon
And that it fly too high and shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon

Oh oh oh

They call him Hermit the Frog
He's looking for a dog
Did you find a bitch in me
Oh you're a abominable socially
You're just a little bit too much like me

Says you used to be so kind
Well baby I give you your dirty mind
I wanna tell you a secret
You can take your double standard love and keep it
I can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
I can't help he sometimes like to come and rest his little head

Well my heart just burst like a glass baloon
We let them fly too high and they shattered too soon
They'll be the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room
We broke our glass balloons
We let go of their glass balloons
We broke our glass balloons
Let go of my glass balloon

Well my heart just burst like a glass baloon
We let them fly too high and they shattered too soon
They'll be the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room
We broke our glass balloons
We let go of their glass balloons
We broke our glass balloons
Let go of my glass balloon
