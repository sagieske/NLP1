Song:

My conscience is hurting my ear
But I'm happy as long as you are
I hide if I can
I don't care where I stand
As long as you are bent down

You never said what does it mean
I'm speaking the same words again
But I will if you have to fall
I'm here if you want me at all
Just as long as you are bent down

She feels I'm laid out for everything here
She keeps me away from this song of mine

I don't know why this won't stop
Cause maybe it just won't stop
But it will if I hear you call
But maybe you don't care at all
But at least you're the one bent down

She feels I'm laid out for everything here
She keeps me away from this song of mine

You could be here
Or you can be here
As close as I can hold
Together as we're told
But we were the ones bent down
