Song:

You're my muse you're my silly goose and every day is a dreamy day of
Daydreaming of you. You're my one you're my honey bun and every day is a dreamy
Day of daydreaming of you. I can dream of you without snoring and I'm lucky that
That's true. Because everyone would know that I found them boring simply because
They're not you. All I want to do is lay in the daisies and daydream of you know
Who I'm referring to... You. You're my love you're my star above And everyday is
A dreamy day of daydreaming of you
