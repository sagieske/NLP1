Song:

It's like loving a lion that cannot be tamed,
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name.
Pulling teeth from my stomach,
You've been eaten alive.
My blood fills your lungs,
My soul, your inside.

My feet they stand on ashes,
From the fires that you've made.
Burning bridges,
Just to save your face.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
Tell me who is to blame?

I'm sensing a feeling picking wounds of regret,
That left alone there's no scarring I'll dig & I'll dig,
Scratching & itching I'll keep biting my lip,
From this pain that I'm feeling,
Picking wounds of regret.

A cut cannot heal,
Unless you leave it alone.
I'll open mine daily,
Leaving bones exposed.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
Tell me who is to blame?

Standing on ashes from the fires you've made,
Burning your bridges just to save your face.

Wounds of regret.

If I say I wouldn't be hostile,
Could you say you would do the same?
If we're all made just a little bit broken,
Tell me who is to blame?

We're broken, imperfect,
We were all made the same.
We're broken, imperfect,
We are all to blame.
