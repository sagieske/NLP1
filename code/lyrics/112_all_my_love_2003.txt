Song:

Tell me how far do you want this to go
I'm touching the places no one needs to know
I can feel your heart is beating fast
How can we make it last
Give it to me slowly

Give me your heart and soul
Give me your everything
Baby just let it go
When we make love, feeling our fantasies
I can't believe this is happening

Chorus:
All my love, we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back, love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love, tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there, baby when we touch
Love is gonna take control, giving you all my love
All my love

I can feel your body shivering, love's so tasty
Baby when I'm holding you
Feels so good I can't resist those s*** lips
Baby when I'm kissing you
Give it to me slowly

Give me your heart and soul
Give me your everything
Baby just let it go
When we make love, sharing our fantasies
I can't believe this is happening

Chorus:
All my love, we can take this fast or slow
Let me touch your soul
Don't look back, love is gonna take control
Giving you all my love
All my love, tonight it's you and me
Can we take it there, baby when we touch
Love is gonna take control, giving you all my love
All my love

Baby don't stop, would you stay right there
Baby don't stop, that's it, stay right there
Fast or slow, I'm ready to go
Baby take me there (Won't you please take me there)
Girl I love the way you're holding me
And the way that you're kissing me
Baby hold on, I'm about to give you, give it all to you

Repeat Chorus 4X
