Song:

[Intro:]
Yea I see her, px

[Verse:]
Swear I'm gone, gettin' gone with my n****s
We hit the club, n****s cups full of jealous
We in the back and we muggin' to T. I. (you know it)
And I'm with a bad b***h and I got an idea (oh yeah)

[Bridge:]
(I'll still say) This b***h looks like Lindsay Lohan
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin'
That b***h bad, watch her blow a whole band

[Hook:]
She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
I don't know how she does it
She gets her way, way

[Verse 2:]
Shawty said she wanna roll with the Sauga City come up
She wasn't on a roll, now she roll with a winner (rollin' marijuana)
See them dark-skin girls in them light-skin crews
Yah, we see you
But she the light-skin girl in a light-skin crew
She don't know what to do

[Bridge:]

[Hook:]
She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
I don't know how she does it
She gets her way, way

[Verse 3:]
She just turned twenty-five
But she wanna roll with young n****s like
Roll with the clique, ohh, roll with the clique
Now she say
Gone, gettin' gone with them n****s
Swear I just saw her say
We in the back and we muggin' to T. I
Swear I just saw her say
Gone, gettin' gone with them n****s
If this what she want to be
Then she can have her way
Oh no no no
Yeah yeah
No baby
You could have your way
No no

[Hook:]
She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
I don't know how she does it
She gets her way, way
