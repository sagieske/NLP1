Song:

I guess it's funnier from where you're standing
Cause from over here I missed the joke
Clear the way for my crash landing
I've done it again, another number for your notes

I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
I'd be patient if I had the time
I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out, how I can move from the back of the line

I'll be your clown, behind the glass
Go head and laugh, cause it's funny
I would too, if I saw me
I'll be your clown, on your favourite channel
My life's a circus circus, round in circles, selling out tonight

I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition
I'll have time for please, I'll have time for thank you as soon as I win

I'll be your clown, behind the glass
Go head and laugh, cause it's funny
I would too, if I saw me
I'll be your clown, on your favourite channel
My life's a circus circus, round in circles, selling out tonight

From the distance my choice is simple
From the distance I can entertain
So you can see me I out makeup on my face
But there's no way you can feel it, from so far away

I'll be your clown, behind the glass
Go head and laugh, cause it's funny
I would too, If I saw me
I'll be your clown, on your favourite channel
My life's a circus circus, round in circles, I'm selling out tonight
