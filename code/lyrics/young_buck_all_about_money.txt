[Young Buck]
You a thug like me

[Verse:]
You can catch me green stick it up,
D**k it up,
Cut a n***a s**t over 50 bucks,
Need work on the low n***a hit me up,
Never quick enough after pickin up,
Feds on a n***a block ridiculous,
Cuz the game done brought all our s**t to us,
I done bit the dust-countinus
Now I ride double? To the ind you bust,
Oh no wrong move if my ind you touch,
17 but it's real when you playin with much,
One in the chamber on the table when you chillin for lunch,
And head up with your door open feelin your blunt,
Where I'm from 20 gone by the end of the month,
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt,
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump,
If it's on-first draw that's a n***a wit luck,
All n****s playin games start endin em up,
Cuz your block young buck will start bendin em up,
As soon as your adrenaline pump,
Make way dear lord cuz I'm sendin em up

[Chorus x2]
Its all about money,
Gettin major paid,
Stack your cheese in all different ways,
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased,
Yeah n***a, you a thug like me?

[Verse 2 - D-tay]
They call me D-tays up
Get em up put the aks on,
Let em know we don't play sir,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Anybody in the way gets sprayed brah,
Wanna play rough?
Yall cats wanna play tough
Tay wanna spray stuff, erase stuff
N****s wanna start s**t with they gun then run,
Tay don't wanna chase ya,
Bullets wait ta, replace ya,
Hit em with the shells of the 45,
Make em all duck, with the four-five buck,
Put em all up,
Got 2 so we got you but we don't give a f**k,
Seals comin gunnin out the cut,
Spittin at you cats,
Spittin 50 rounds like I'm spittin on a track,
Yall n****s know that you can't hold that,
Ima spit the gat till the gat click-clat,
Then chit chat,
N****s gun learn that you beef with this here this heat gone burn,
Ima show ya cats how to bus yall guns,
Hit a n***a up and leave his a** left numb,
Don't play with me,
You know I spray the heat,
The A. K. Gun n****s down fatefully,
You think expectfully, just wait and see,
Young buck and D-tay n***a ready to g,
If it pays to be, the boss in the cause,
My gun so big gotta limp when I walk,
Don't talk the talk cuz T. I. P. We comin,
First go about money

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
Its all bout thuggin,
Gettin paid and s**t,
You either slang the dope or hit major licks,
That's why all my n****s be sevin bricks,
Yall gunna see what we workin with,
Not me baby doll,
I aint hurtin for s**t,
G. S. 400 with a leather kit,
Oh you don't wanna holla?
Well whatever b***h,
Don't say s**t when the bezzle flip,
See a n***a tote straps for the hell of it,
I aint givin a f**k about jealous s**t,
And I don't smoke weed for the smell of it,
Just before I kill, I inhale the s**t,
You can't trail me b***h I be in 50 states,
Paranoid, with about 50 cakes,
Once a n***a find out it's all heart no shake,
That's when I infest the place,
I'm thugged out,
Up in the drug house,
Got it all-from the beer to a quarter ounce,
We da real a** n****s, all work no slouch,
Can I get that there? All that count,
All they amount,
But when it go down and a n***a make all ya say all that out,
What you gunna do n***a what you about,
Either ride or die, when I'm raised in the south,
Love the block, when a n***a wake up,
I wash my face and then hug my glock,
Brush my teeth and scream south side,
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks,
But it still don't stop, from dusk to dawn,
A n***a been out here on his own-livin day to day,
See I'm only 17 but a n***a out here just gains farm
