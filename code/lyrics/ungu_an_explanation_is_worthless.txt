Song:

Were these bonds ever real?
The truth can't be viewed through closed eyes
Can a picture be painted with words?
Show me a real apology

It only takes one mistake to prove anyone wrong
But time heals all wounds, that's what I've been told

I'm sorry is never as sincere the second time

A smile is no good for me
I can't forgetlies are becoming way too common
Not only to others but to myself

You have no idea how I feel
I can't make it any clearer!
