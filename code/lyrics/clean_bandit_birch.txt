Song:

I was a fool for you and
I went all round town
When I finally saw you
Now I'm speaking to make this something
Cold [x7]

It's not enough to hear you
Your voice will never be
I find I hate to be near you
I, I long to see this evening through
Cold [x6]

I call home
Call home
Call home
Call home

Call home
Call home
