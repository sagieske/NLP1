Verse 1:
Whatever V. I. P.
Sneekin' in the back
Corrupt the whole scene
Sure come scan my fake I'd
Sure buy me a ten dollar drink
I'll take you for a ride kid
If you got the balls if
You can take the discotheque
Uh

I got the joint
I know the spot
I got my ride tricked
I got the right fix
Boy can you hang with this

Where you wanna go is not the case
We're about to go to outer space
So come with me to my special place

Chorus:
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watchin' the mirror ceilings
And dance all night
A la Discotheque
A la Discotheque
Discothque

Verse 2:
Think you're so fresh, so fresh
So fresh
I'm sayin I'm not impressed
Let's roll to the East side
Hollywood's freeze dried (boring)
Then let's work it out
For you an exception
Come play in my direction
There's spray paint
There's whiskey
There's beats that make you
Rock til ya drop!

I got the joint
I know the spot
I got my ride tricked
I got the right fix
Boy can you hang with this

Where you wanna go is not the case
Oh-oh
We're about to go to outer space
So come with me to my special place

Chorus:
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Then we'll fall in love
Oh-ohoh-oh
Under the Neon sign
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Watchin' the mirror ceilings
And dance all night
A la Discotheque
Oh-oh
