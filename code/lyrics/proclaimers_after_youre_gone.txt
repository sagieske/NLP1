Song:

The love you leave
Will be there after you're gone.
Will be there after you're gone.
Still be there after you're gone.

The air you breathe
Will be there after you're gone.
Will be there after you're gone.
Still be there after you're gone.

The lochs and seas
Will be there after you're gone.
Will be there after you're gone.
Still be there after you're gone.

Three score years and ten of joy and pain
Adds up to mayflies on the windowpane.
The windowpane.

The mystery
Will be there after you're gone.
Will be there after you're gone.
Still be there after you're gone.

The lochs and seas
Will be there after you're gone.
Will be there after you're gone.
Still be there after you're gone.
Gone.
