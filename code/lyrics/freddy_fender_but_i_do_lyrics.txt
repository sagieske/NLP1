Song:

I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so, but I do
I only know I'm lonely
And that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do.
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do~ I feel so helpless
And since you've been away
I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you but I do.
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I stand it, but I do~~
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wastin' time
But I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I love you but I do.
