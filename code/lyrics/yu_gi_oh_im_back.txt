Song:

Disappeared
Out of here
It was time to pay my dues
Never guessed
That you'd be dressed
In my clothes and in my shoes
You couldn't wait to move right in
If I were you I'd be concerned
Ain't no way you're gonna win
Betcha didn't count on my return
_CHORUS_
You thought you were so tough
You had it all under control
Now enough is enough
Gonna take back what you stole
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back}
On my own
All alone
This ain't how the story ends
Now I see
Those close to me
They were just fair-weather friends
You suckered everyone in sight
With promises that fooled them all
You may be top dog tonight
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
_CHORUS_
You thought you were so tough
You had it all under control
Now nothing's enough
Gonna take back what you stole
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back}
"For our planet to succeed, Kaiba must be taken out of the picture, permanently."
"You'll never take me alive!"
"Seto Kaiba will bother us no more, hahahahahaha!"
"I'm not going to give up Kaiba Corporation without a real fight!"
"It's takeover time, by me."
"I attack with the Blue Eyes White Dragon!"
_CHORUS_
You thought you were so tough
You had it all under control
Now nothing's enough
Gonna take back what you stole
{Give it up, 'cause now I'm back}
"We're going in."
"Big brother, you're here! You're here!"
