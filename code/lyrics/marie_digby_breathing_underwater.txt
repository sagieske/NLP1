Song:

There's a light in the dark
Where the sky splits apart
Where the stars find a way
To shine through all the spaces in between
Here we are face to face
All alone in this place
And the night is finally coming down to you and me

Tell me where you've been hiding?
Ooooh I want to know
You're my silver lining covered in gold
Tell me what am I feeling?
Well it's hard to explain
Like underwater breathing
Swimming in rain

Oh oh... All I really wanna do, do
Is fall a little deeper with you, you
And never come up, breathing breathing underwater
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy
You are making me feel, feel
Like I'm breathing, breathing breathing underwater

I wanna fly through the blue
Lay on the bottom with you
Get lost in the waves,
Let the world slip away
When nobody can find us,

I don't wanna be saved
Leave it all behind us,
Make an escape
Tell me what am I feeling?
Ohhh it's hard to explain
Like underwater breathing,
Swimming in rain

Oh oh... All I really wanna do, do
Is fall a little deeper with you, you
And never come up, breathing breathing underwater
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy
You are making me feel, feel
Like I'm breathing, breathing breathing underwater

Wanna go to the edge
Wanna dive in again
Here we are face to face
All alone in this place
And it's finally coming down to you and me

Oh oh... All I really wanna do, do
Is fall a little deeper with you, you
And never come up, breathing breathing underwater
Weightless with every little kiss you steal, boy
You are making me feel, feel
Like I'm breathing, breathing breathing underwater
