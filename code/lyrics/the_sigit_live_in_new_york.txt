Song:

You got me lying
On the ground
But if you find me
Don't mess me round
Get girls left and right
Gonna sleep all day
And drink all night
Get my cash get my career
You want my money don't get near dear
Bite the fingers no I don't care
This is my sweet revenge

Or may be we could go for ride
You got me tired till the sun go down

If I could live in new york
If I could live in new york
If I could live in new york
If only I could live in new york

Got me talking on radio
Cos people going back to rock n roll
Looking me and my big scar
Now don't you miss me I'm missing somehow
Get my cash get my career
You want my money don't get near dear
Bite the finger no I don't care
This is my sweet revenge

Or may be we get more higher
You got my head spinning round and around

If I could live in new york
If I could live in new york
If I could live in new york
If only I could live in new york
