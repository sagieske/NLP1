Song:

Stabbing, raping, tear them into pieces
Screaming, crying, (just) deny it
Hide your senses

It's happening again
I'm waking up in an embrace of red
Just like the days before
Examining the stains, looking for wounds without result
The blood is not mine

Stabbing, raping, tear them into pieces
Screaming, crying, (just) deny it
Hide your senses

(In this) obscurity, paralysed in self-satisfaction
Stranded in this scene of violence

I'm escaping from it again
Crawling out back in to the shadow
I rearrange my life

This is my new world. Welcome to Amnesia
Broken down on another faceless day
One more statement from the watchers of my parade

It's happening again
I'm waking up in an embrace of red
Just like the days before
Examining the stains, looking for wounds without result
The blood is not mine

This is my new world. Welcome to Amnesia
Broken down on another faceless day
One more statement from the watchers of my parade

Amnesia

Stabbing, raping, tear them into pieces
Screaming, crying, (just) deny it
Hide your senses
