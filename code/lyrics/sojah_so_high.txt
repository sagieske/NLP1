Refrain:
Babylon burn burn burn.
Sojah representing.
We dream of this wonderful time, 
Now we want a reality, 
Where we can smoke marijuana every day without noя apologies, 

And even when we eyes them red like blood babylon can't pene we, 
Cause a da healing of the nation, 
And H.I.M. no want no aggravation.

Youthman step out inna babylon face, 
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze, 
Smoke marijuana weя get so high like birds in the sky we fly.

Verse I:
Watch how we do, burn a spliff
Whole a medi, ? trail fi sendя babylon go cemetery
Where we mek we talk and try fi market
Always dem a try find the weed dem want fi stop it
So we roll the dutchie and we blaze up the kutchie
Try to load the weed and babylon dem can't touch it
We want fi blaze every day
We nah give a fuck what babylon man say

Chorus:
Youthman step out inna babylon face, 
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze, 
Smoke marijuana weя get so high like birds in the sky we fly. (2x)

Verse II:
Yo we burn the herbs and get high
Blaze it up in front of the policeman ay
Ganja we a smoke but the coke we nah try
When dem ask you why tell them it was sent to I by The Most High
It was found pon Solomon grave and him a the wisest man
See the spliff inna mi hand youя better try get one
We want nuff nuff nuff nuff weed to go around
Yo from Jamaica we ship a thousand miles

Chorus:
Youthman step out inna babylon face, 
Spliff in a we mouth and the chalice we a blaze, 
Smoke marijuana weя get so high like birds in the sky we fly. (2x)
