Song:

It looks that way
The way you say
She talks she knows

I do not know that this is so
I only just suppose
I suppose that when you come ino the ballroom
and the room itself is floating in the air
If your suddenly confronted by his highness
you are frozen like a statue on the stair
You're afraid he'll hear the way your heart is beating
and you know you musn't make the first advance
You're seriously thinking of reatreating
Then you seen to hear him asking you to dance

A lovely night
A lovely night
A finer night you know you'll never see


You meet your prince
A charming prince
As charming as a prince will ever be

The stars in a hazy heaven
Tremble above you
While he's whispering,"Darling, I love you"


You say goodbye away you fly
But on your lips
You keep a kiss
All your life you'll dream of this

Lovely, lovely night
