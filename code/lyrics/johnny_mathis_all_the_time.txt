Song:

I want you with me all the time:
Sunrise and sunset and all the time.
You are the one love I have waited for;
Had we just begun, love,
Could I love you more?

Warm as the May wine, wild as the sea,
These are the feelings you waken in me.
I've had my moments and a dream or two.
But I needed someone all the time
And all the time it was you.

(Instrumental interlude and pick up.)

Warm as the May wine, wild as the sea,
These are the feelings you waken in me.
I've had my moments and a dream or two.
But I needed someone all the time
And all the time it was you.
