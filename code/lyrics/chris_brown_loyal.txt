Young Mula, baby

[Lil' Wayne]
I went to born last night
I know this hoes ain't right
But you was blown up a phone last night
But she ain't have a ring on, her ring on last night, oh
N***a, that's that nerve
Why give a b***h your heart?
When she rather have a purse
Why give a b***h your inch?
When she rather have nine
You know how the game goes
She be mine, but I have time, I'm the s**t, oh
N*gga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about her
Birdman, do you in this b***h, no flamingos
And not a day, everyday, but trust these hoes

[Chris Brown]
When I rich n***a want you
And your n***a can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's b***h
I can make a broke b***h rich
But I don't f**k with broke b*****s
Got a white girl with some freight tities
I took her to the bay with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up the bar, molly I'm a rockstar
She wanna do drugs, smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a n***a trapped
She wanna f**k all the rappers

When I rich n***a want you
And your n***a can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad b***h, let's get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this b***h with your man
That's a no no girl
All is funny in the air
I wanna see you dance

Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's b***h
I can make a broke b***h rich
But I don't f**k with broke b*****s

When I rich n***a want you
And your n***a can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[French Montana]
What's a rock in the system?
Ain't no tell her what I f**k, well I dissed them
That's what they be yelling, I'm a pimp by blood
No relation, I don't chase some, I re-play some
Lvs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes, ain't loyal, they rotting
School me to the game, now I'm on a goody
Put it in the loader
She was riding in the hoot
F**k that b***h
I got my own hoe
F**k your wig
I got my own smoke
Had to put my ming back on
Tell that b***h
Put a ring back on
Montana

[Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet a houndred dollars she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on it
And it's all for nothing

When I rich n***a want you
And your n***a can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

When I rich n***a want you
And your n***a can do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

These hoes ain't loyal
