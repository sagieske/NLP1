Song:

Them want I(2x)
Be com'a them funeral
Them claim say(2x)
Them are the general
(2x)
What a big disgrace
The way you rob up the place
Rob everthing you can find
Yes you did
And you'll even rob from the blind
You must see want I fe
Com'a com'a funeral
And I no go
No one burial
Yet you want I
Com'a com'a funeral
Make your friend come claim say, claim say
You are the geni???
Now we know the truth
Yes we do
Find you
Wearing the boot
Of taking people's business on your head, yeah
So might as well you be dead
[Chorus:]
Let the dead bury the dead now
And who is to be fed, be fed
I ain't got no time to waste on you, no, no
I'm A livin man, I got work to do
Right now
This man and that man
Yes they are the same man
You taught us this just as well
That the rich man heaven is the poor man's hell
You must see want I fe com'a com'a funeral
Natty no go no one burial
Yet you want I
Com'a com'a burial
Make your friend come claim say
You are the geni....
