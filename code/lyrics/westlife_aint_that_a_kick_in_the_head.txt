Song:

(Shane)How lucky can one guy be?
(Kian)I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said,
(Shane)"Ain't that a kick in the head?"

(Mark)The room was completely black,
I hugged her and she hugged back
Like the sailor said, quote,
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

(Nicky)My head keeps spinnin',
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'
(Shane)If this is just the beginnin',
My life is gonna be bea-you-ti-ful

(Shane)I've sunshine enough to spread,
It's just like the fella said
And be quick, Ain't love a kick in the head?

(Shane)Like the fella once said,
"Ain't that a kick in the head?"

(Mark)Like the sailor said, quote,
"Ain't that a hole in the boat?"

(Nicky)My head keeps spinnin',
I go to sleep and keep grinnin'

(Shane)If this is just the beginnin',
My life is gonna be bee-yoo-tee-ful

(Kian)She's tellin' me we'll be wed,
(Mark)she's picked out a king-size bed
(Shane)I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick
Tell me quick oh, ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick ain't love a kick in the head?
