Song:

Lock of the lips
To seal the night
That was the momen
Everything felt right
The warmth of your breath
The hands touch my neck
And I have fallen
Yes I have fallen for you

Eyes wide awake
Till the break of dawn
Stuck inside a moment
When nothing could go wrong
When the Earth was slow & still
But the time seemed to run faster
And then what happened next
Was the kiss
That I could not forget

So this is what it feels like
Not to be alone
This is what it feels like
To know you've got someone
I can feel it oooh
In every inch of my soul
Now I know oooh
I am never gonna let go
Never, No

Danced to the beat
Of a different drum
No more turning back
Insides come undone

The warmth of your breath
The hands touch my neck
And I have fallen
Yes, I have fallen for you

So this is what it feels like
Not to be alone
This is what it feels like
To know you've got someone
I can feel it oooh
In every inch of my soul
Now I know oooh
I am never gonna let go
Never, No

Arm feel empty as you go
I miss you more than
You will ever know
So don't you go
You go, you go
You go, you go
Don't you go

So this is what it feels like
Not to be alone
This is what it feels like
To know you've got someone
I can feel it oooh
In every inch of my soul
Now I know oooh
I am never gonna let go
Never, No

Next time can't come soon enough,
Love & I need to see you now
Next time can't come soon enough,
Love & I need to see you now
Next time can't come soom enough,
Love & I need to see you now
Next time can't come soon enough,
Love & all I need to see you now.
