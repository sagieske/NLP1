Song:

If you're gonna give me good kisses like that
Honey don't you know I'm gonna give them right back
'Cause that's a kissing good way
(Mmmm that's a kissing good way)
Ah that's a kissing good way
(That's a kissing good way)
That's a kissing good way
To mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)

Ooh if you're gonna start out hugging me tight (right)
Don't mess around come and hug me right
'Cause that's a hugging good way
(That's a hugging good way) Yeah ha ha
That's a hugging good way (that's a hugging good way)
That's a hugging good way
To mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, Sing it Bonnie, Don't mess around)

You know you called me on the phone (Yeah I got your number)
Just because I was alone
Ah you came around a wooing (why not)
You better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doing

Now that you've kissed me and you rocked my soul
Don't come round knocking rock 'n' roll
'Cause that's a hugging good way
(That's a rocking good way) That's a rocking good way
(That's a rocking good way) That's a rocking good way
To mess around and fall in love
Don't mess around (Tell me baby) Don't mess around

Well now you call me on the phone (yeah baby)
And just because I was alone
You came around a wooing (woh!)
Ah, you better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doing

Ah you kiss me and you rock my soul (I love your soul)
Don't come round knocking rock 'n' roll
'Cause that's a hugging good way (That's a rocking good way)
Shakey that's a rocking good way, That's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way to mess around and fall in love, yeah
(Don't mess around) What a way to go (Don't mess around)
It's a rocking good way, That's a rocking good way
Mmmm that's a rocking good way (That's a rocking good way)
That's a rocking good way to mess around and fall in love
(Don't mess around, don't mess around)
Yeah, that's a rocking good way to mess around and fall in love
Keep on rocking (I'm with you baby)
It's a rocking good way (Ah, you'd better know it)
A rocking good way
Ah baby you've got what it takes...
