Song:

Loving you was just a storybook of fair
I've decided there ain't no real life anywhere
Soon I'll be a faded picture in the book of your mind
Another town is somewhere down the line.

Another town, another grocery store
Another town, another set of swinging doors
Somehow I'm a little bit suspecious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind.

--- Instrumental ---

Tell your mama she was sure a dandy cook
Tell your papa that I understood his looks
If I put it all together you're a piece that wouldn't fit
Another town's a comin' up I guess.

Another town, another grocery store
Another town, another set of swinging doors
Somehow I'm a little bit suspecious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind.

--- Instrumental ---

As I leave you let me leave you with this thought
Time is candy and we ate all that we bought
Those little tears you're cryin' are just wrappers on the ground
That a new wind blows into another town.

Another town, another grocery store
Another town another set of swinging doors
Somehow I'm a little bit suspecious in my mind
It's another town that don't need my kind.

It's another town that don't need my kind...
