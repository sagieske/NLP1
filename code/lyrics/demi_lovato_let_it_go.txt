Song:

[Chorus]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

[Verse 1]
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl
You always had to be
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know
Well, now they know

[Chorus]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let it go
Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve

[Chorus]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let it go
Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

[Bridge]
Standing frozen in the life I've chosen
You won't find me, the past is all behind me
Buried in the snow

[Chorus]
Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let it go
Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
