Song:

Christmas always goes too fast
It's up to us to make it last
And all I want for Christmas is love
Come that morning and I see you smile
It only lasts a little while
How come we seem to push it all side?

Chorus
Don't you know that it's
Christmas time again
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year

Soon it seems to disappear
It brings us towards the leaves of tear
The day is done but spirit should remain
It's times like these we need a change
A calander to rearrange
I'll make sure it'll last all year

Chorus
Christmas time again
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year

Got to give a little more
Remember what we're thanking for
All my love, mankind
Let's pretend just this time
Let's keep the flow this time
Then our Christmas's will last all year

Chorus
Christmas time again
I'm happy for you
You know it comes and goes
So let's pretend that it'll last all year

Born is the king of Israel
