Song:

It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter

Who's to say when love
Will knock on your heart
So be ready to let it in

And who can tell if love
Is real before it starts
You never know until you're in it

So don't hear them when they whisper
That this love is not enough for you
Cause they know they'll never find
True love like yours and mine
And that's the bottom line

Oh, oh, it doesn't matter
What your friends all say
It don't matter, love you anyway
It doesn't matter cause
You stay on my mind

It doesn't matter
What you put me through
It don't matter
Gonna keep on loving you
It doesn't matter
Cause you stay in my life

Rumours fly when people
Have something to fear
It's no telling about it, no

Just weaving lies for
Anyone who wants to hear
Some people just can't
Do without it, no

So don't listen when they tell you
That this love is never gonna last
Cause they know they'll never find
True love like yours and mine
And that's the bottom line

Remember, it doesn't matter
What your friends all say
It don't matter, love you anyway
It doesn't matter cause
You stay on my mind

Oh, oh, it doesn't matter
What you put me through
It don't matter
Gonna keep on loving you
It doesn't matter
Cause you stay in my life

It doesn't matter
What your friends all say
It don't matter, love you anyway
It doesn't matter cause
You stay on my mind
Stay on my mind, all the time, yeah

It doesn't matter
What you put me through
It don't matter
Gonna keep on loving you
It doesn't matter
Cause you stay in my life

Oh, I'll never leave you
All the way, yeah
Won't have to beg you
To stay with me

Oh, oh, I'll prove it to you
That my love is real
By the way it feels

By the way, by the way
The way it feels

It doesn't matter
What your friends all say
It don't matter, love you anyway
It doesn't matter cause
You stay on my mind

It doesn't matter
What you put me through
It don't matter
Gonna keep on loving you
It doesn't matter
Cause you stay in my life
(Stay in my life)

It doesn't matter
What your friends all say
(It don't matter)
It don't matter, love you anyway
(Gonna love you anyway)
It doesn't matter cause
You stay on my mind
Stay on my mind, all the time, yeah

It doesn't matter
What you put me through
(What you put me through)
It don't matter
Gonna keep on loving you
(Oh, gonna love you, love you)
It doesn't matter
Cause you stay in my life

Oh, yeah (it don't matter)
It don't matter
(No, no, it don't matter)
(Stay in my life) oh, yeah

All right now (it don't matter)
(No, no, it don't matter)
