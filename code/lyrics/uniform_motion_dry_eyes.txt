Song:

Swamp stewing in the grass, 
Where you wept.
You wipe your fingers clean of the tears
Your dry eyes for all to see.
Salty and blind, 
And open wide

Grab a chair and catch a read, 
Of your life and where it leads.
This story reveals this side of you, 
The one you wished you never knew.

In this storm shore home, 
Safe and secure.
In a mutant roar I follow you home, 
With dry eyes for all to see.
Salty and blind, 
And open wide, 
Safe and secure, 

With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
With dry eyes for all to see
Dry eyes for all to see
