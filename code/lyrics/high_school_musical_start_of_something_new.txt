[*{VERSE}*]

[TROY] Livin' in my own world
Didn't understand
That anything can happen
When you take a chance

[GABRIELLA] I never believed in
What I couldn't see
I never opened my heart
[TROY] Ohhhhh
[GABRIELLA] Too all the possibilities, Ohh

[Both] I know...
[GABRIELLA] That something has changed
[Both] Never felt this way
[GABRIELLA] And right here tonight
[Both] this could be the...

[*{CHORUS}*]

[Both] Start of somethin' new
[GABRIELLA] It feels so right
[Both] To be here with you, ooh
And now lookin' in your eyes
[GABRIELLA] I feel in my heart
[TROY] Feel in my heart
[Both] The start of somethin' new
[TROY] Ohhhh, yeahh

[*{VERSE}*]

[TROY] Now who'd of ever thought that... oh
[Both] We'd both be here tonight... yeah
[GABRIELLA] Oh yeah, the world looks so much
brighter
[TROY] Brighter, brighter
[GABRIELLA] Oh, with you by my side
[TROY] By my side
[BOTH] I know... that somethin' has changed
Never felt this way
[GABRIELLA] oh I know it for real
[Both} This could be the...

[*{CHORUS}*]

[BOTH] start of somethin' new
It feels so right to be here with you... oh
And now... lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of somethin' new

[*{BRIDGE}*]

[TROY] I never knew that it could happen
'Til it happened to me
Ohhhh, yeah
[Both] I didn't know it before
[GABRIELLA] But now it's easy to see
[Both] Ohhhhh

[*{CHORUS}*]

[Both] It's the start of something new
It feels so right to be here with you... oh
And now... lookin' in your eyes
I feel in my heart
That it's the start of somethin' new
It feels so right
[TROY] So right... oh
[GABRIELLA] To be here with you... oh
[Both] And now...
[GABRIELLA} Lookin' in your eyes
[TROY] Lookin' in your eyes
[GABRIELLA] I feel in my heart
[TROY] Feel in my heart
[GABRIELLA] The start of somethin' new
[TROY] The start of somethin' new
[GABRIELLA] The start of somethin' new
[TROY] Somethin' new
