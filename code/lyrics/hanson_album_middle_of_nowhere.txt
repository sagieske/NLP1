Thinking Of You

Have you ever stood outside a picket fence
You could see through but you can't get to the inside
You sit there and wait
I look at you and anticipate
What we could be and what we could do
Fly the wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
Fly with wings of an eagle
Glide along with the wind
No matter how high
I'll be thinking of you the whole time
I'm carrying this heavy load
I don't know what to do
The only thing I know is that
I'm in love with you Oh
Fly the wings of an eagle
No matter how high
I'll be thinkin' of you

(Repeat Chorus)

No matter how high
No matter how low
I'll be thinking of you
No matter what I do
No matter where I go
I'll be thinking of you

(Repeat)

Mmmbop

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You're going through all this pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
And they're gone so fast
So hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care
Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du
Mmm bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, Ba du dop
Ba du bop, Ba du dop
Ba du
Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows

(Repeat Chorus)

In an mmm bop they're gone. In an mmm bop they're not there.
In an mmm bop they're gone. In an mmm bop they're not there.
Until you lose your hair. But you don't care.

(Repeat Chorus)

Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.
Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me if it's going to be a daisy or a rose?

Can you tell me which flower's going to grow?
Can you tell me? You say you can but you don't know.

Weird

Isn't it weird. Isn't it strange.
Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train
We're both trying to find a place in the sun
We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes
Isn't it hard. Standing in the rain.
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain
No one can hear though you're screaming so loud
You feel all alone in a faceless crowd
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes.
Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.
Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
When you live in a cookie cutter world being different is a sin.
So you don't stand out. And you don't fit in. Weird.
Sitting on the side. Waiting for a sign. Hoping that my luck will change.
Reaching for a hand that can understand, someone who feels the same.
When you live in a cookie cutter world if you're different you can't win.
So you don't stand out and you don't fit in. Weird.
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird
Strange, how we all get a little bit.
Strange, 'cause we're all just a little bit weird sometimes.

Speechless

Everybody wonders and some people know
I guess that I'm some people 'cause baby it shows
When will you do it? And why will you go?
If you've already decided then deliver the blow
The way you walk around me. The way you talk around me.
You act so speechless. You've got nothing to say.
The way you walk around me. The way you're talking to me.
Makes me wonder. If this was only play.
And I wonder will you still love me?
Do you still love me, like you did before.
Said come on baby you think I'm so blind
I see what you're doing behind my back all the time
I get suspicious when you call me someone else's name
You think I don't notice that nothing's the same... Anymore

(Repeat Chorus)

And I wonder will you still love me?
Did you ever love me, or were you playing with me before
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time

(Repeat Chorus)

And I wonder will you still love me?
Did you ever love me, or are you showing me the door
Ohh baby you think I'm so blind
Ohh baby I'm not playing around this time
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where's the Love

Something has been going on and I don't know what it is
You don't mind the taking girl, but you don't know how to give
You drove me crazy but I don't know baby
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Where's the right in, all of our fighting?
Look at what you're doing
Where's the love
It's not enough
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and...
Where's the love
Give it up
It makes the world go 'round and 'round and 'round
Can you tell me what you see whenever you look around?
We're tripping all over ourselves and pulling each other down
We're separating, consciousness is fading
Are you thinking that it's me you're fooling?
Where's the right in, all of our fighting?
Look at, look at, look at what we're doing

(Repeat Chorus)

Dark clouds all around, lightning, rain pouring down
Waiting for the bright light to break through
Face down on the ground
Pick us up at the lost and found
We've got to change our point of view, if we want the sky blue
We're segregating, consciences are fading
You're thinking that it's me you're fooling
Where's the right in, all of our fighting
Look at what we're doing

(Repeat Chorus)

Won't you, won't you give it up

Yearbook Song

Dear Amy, see you in September
Hope that you remember me next year
Hey Jamie, you've been a great friend to me
I hope that I'll still see you around here
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
There's a name without a picture, but I can't forget his face
Tell me where did he go, I want to know
Where did Johnny go?
It says, "Picture unavailable" right here
More than sad, it makes me mad to know somebody knows
There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Poor Katie, she won't even speak his name
None of us will ever be the same
It's quiet in the halls, but I hear echoing off the walls.
The rumors of Johnny's mystery
'Cause I'm looking through the yearbook then I find that empty space
No he never wrote me nothing, but I can't forget his face

(Repeat Chorus)

Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Sometimes I think I hear him calling out my name
Sometimes I wonder if maybe we're to blame
It's been a year now and a lot of things have changed
But I keep thinking about Johnny. I keep turning to that page.
Where did he go I want to know, Where did he go I want to know?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
Ohhh. There's a lying in your silence. Tell me where did Johnny go?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look At You

Look at you baby
Standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here
Wishing something would happen, maybe I could disappear
She walks in with that look in her eye
Somehow she doesn't even have to try
Just kick off your shoes, get on the floor
This is what we came here for
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
You've got to get it out
Just get on the floor
Everybody wonders when they look at you
Everybody wonders what you're gonna do
You got it all wrapped up you do
Everybody wonders when they look at, look at you
Look at you baby, look at you baby
In the middle of the dance floor lights shinin' in my face
Twistin', shoutin' there was no doubt people dancing all over the place
Out of the corner of my eye she said why don't you come and give it a try
Get on the floor, just kick off your shoes
You ain't got a thing to lose
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
It's time to get it out
Just get on the floor

(Repeat Chorus)

Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Look at you, look at you baby
Ooooh, Whoooooa, Whoooooa, baby
I was standing in the shadows wondering what I'm doing here
Wishin' something would happen so that I could disappear
She breaks the silence with a move of her hips
You better hang on don't want to lose your grip
Kick off your shoes, get on the floor
This is what we're waiting for
Oooooh, you've got to break it down
You've got to get it out. Just get on the floor.

Lucy

The day that I left Lucy
A tear fell from her eye
Now I don't have nobody, and I was such a fool
On the day that I left Lucy.
The day that I left Lucy she cried, then said goodbye
Now it's done, and it's over, and I am all alone
On the day that I left Lucy
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing
'Cause you were everything, everything to me
I didn't realize I felt this way, until that day
Today I'm missing Lucy, and you say that she's ok, I hope she is.
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace...
My Lucy
I love Lucy, Lucy...
On the day that I left Lucy... My Lucy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I Will Come to You

When you have no light to guide you
And no one to walk to walk beside you
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days
And you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'
I will hear your spirit callin'
And I swear I'll be there come what may

(Repeat Chorus)

'Cause even if we can't be together
We'll be friends now and forever
And I swear that I'll be there come what may
When the night is dark and stormy
You won't have to reach out for me
I will come to you
Oh I will come to you
We all need somebody we can turn to
Someone who'll always understand
So if you feel that your soul is dyin'
And you need the strength to keep tryin'
I'll reach out and take your hand

(Repeat Chorus)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Minute Without You

Well I woke up this morning
And the night had been so long
Seems that I had had my mind on you
Well the day, it has begun, and I can't get a minute, can't get a
Minute without you
You're always on my mind, you're always in my head
And I can't live, I can't live another day without you
'Cause when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days
Then a week goes by you know it takes my breath away
All the minutes in the world could never take your place
There's one-thousand-four-hundred-forty hours in my day
I've been trying to call you all day, 'cause I got so many things
That I want to say
I'm going crazy, 'cause all my thoughts are filled with you
There's got to be some way I can get through to you ohh

(Repeat Chorus)

I can't keep myself from thinking about you
It's because I love you, and I know that it's true, whoooa
I'll call it desperation, can't you see it in my eyes?
That I want be with you until the sun falls from the sky

Repeat Chorus)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Madeline

Out my window a memory
I'm dying inside
I know the way it should be
Even though it was right in front of me
It's something I just couldn't see
Your lonely face
Your lonely eyes
But this is something you can't disguise
It's not just me, you feel it too
'Cause you know I belong with you
Look at where we're going
Tell me what can I say
We're tracing our footsteps
We're going the same way
Madeline
Here we go around again
You know it, I know it, don't try to pretend
You know it could be so much better than it's been
Ooooh, here we go around again
I was empty inside but I just didn't know
You are my ten thousand roses and I let you go
Before I make the same mistake just hold me in your arms
We belong you know it in your heart
Look where we're going
No doubt in my mind
Can't you see it's meant to be
Oh, oh, oh... My

(Repeat Chorus)

Here we go 'round again. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go 'round again. Said here we go.
Here we go 'round again. Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go 'round again.
Look at where we're going
Tell me what can I say
We're tracing our footsteps
We're going the same way
Oh my...

(Repeat Chorus)

Madeline, here we go 'round again
Madeline, here we go 'round again
Madeline, here we go 'round again
Oh, my Madeline

With You in Your Dreams

(Dedicated to the memory of our grandmother, Jane Nelson Lawyer)

If I'm gone when you wake up please don't cry
And if I'm gone when you wake up it's not goodbye
Don't look back at this time as a time of heartbreak and distress
Remember me, remember me, 'cause I'll be with you in your dreams
Hooo. Ohh I'll be with you.
If I'm gone when you wake up please don't cry.
And if I'm gone when you wake up don't ask why
Don't look back at this time as a time of heartbreak and distress
Remember me, remember me, cause I'll be with you in your dream, ohh, ohh
Don't cry I'm with you don't cry I'm by your side
Don't cry I'm with you don't cry I'm by your side
And though my flesh is gone, Hoo Ohh
I'll still be with you at all times
And though my body is gone, Hoo Ohh
I'll be there to comfort you at all times
Hoo, ohh, hoo, ohh

(Repeat Chorus)

I don't want you to cry and weep, Hoo Ohh
I want you to go on livin' your life
I'm not sleepin' an endless sleep, Hoo Ohh
Cause in your heart you all have good times

(Repeat Chorus)

Hoo I'll be with you in your dreams

Man From Milwaukee (Garage Mix)

It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
>From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows

Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him some day

He says where he's from is called Albertane
There they use more than 10% of the brain
But you couldn't tell it from they way they behave
They run around in underwear and they never shave

Or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

(Repeat Chorus)

This is Mother Bird calling Baby Bird
Baby Bird come in, come in Baby Bird

For the love of Pete come in!
This is Baby Bird... Sorry I was watching Court tv
Do you copy? Do you copy?
Of course we copy... 24 hours a day... In color

You wouldn't believe me if I told you the rest
The man sitting by me who was barely dressed
Flew off to Milwaukee or perhaps Albertane
And left me at the bus stop just barely sane

I've been sitting here too long thinkin' about Milwaukee
I've been talking too long on my yellow walkie talkie
I'm talking to Mars you may think I'm wacky
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
I know they'll come get me and take me away
I know they'll come get me, come get me someday
If not tomorrow then maybe today
