Song:

Even if you're not here
I will still love you, deep in my heart
I believe you and me
Will be together, eternally

Deep in my sleep, I dream of you
Calling my name
But I wake up late at night
I start to cry and I realize
That you're not right by my side

Even if, you're not here
I will remember, I will not fear
You'll remain in my mind
Even in darkness a light I will find

I see your face my saving grace
I'll keep the faith
And pray you'll come back again
My pain will end. I'll make it through
I'll wait a lifetime for you

[Instrumental]

Aaahhh...

Even if morning breaks
I will remember I will not fear
I'll move on but I'll keep on
Hoping that someday...
Wishes will do...
Come true...
