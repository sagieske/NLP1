Song:

[Verse:]
Said it happened last night about ten to eleven when I first layed eyes on you,
Standing in line, into Club Triple 7, it was just like heaven and a dream come true,
We’re standing at the right place at the right time,
When you, this ehu girl, caused the crime.

[Chorus:]
You’re my pretty little ehu girl who made me a fool in love,
You got my heart all in a whirl and now it needs cooling off,
You set my heart on fire and now I don’t know what to do,
You set my heart on fire and now I’m so in love with you my ehu girl.

[Verse 2:]
Said I’m feeling it now, something I’ve never felt,
My hearts so hot I think I’m gonna melt,
Somehow, I want to see you again
My love, sent from above.
And beautiful girls yes I’ve seen a few,
But out of all the beauty in the world there’s no one quite like you.

[Chorus:]

My ehu girl.

[Bridge:]
The way your ehu hair flows in the air,
The way your shining eyes reflect the sky,
The way your smile burns up my flame,
But I don’t know your name and I guess I’ll call you my...

[Chorus:]
