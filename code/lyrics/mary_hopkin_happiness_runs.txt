Song:

Little pebble upon the sand,
Now you're lying here in my hand
How many years have you been here?
Little human upon the sand
From where I'm lying here in your hand,
You to me are but a passing breeze

The sun will always shine where you stand
Depending in which land
You may find yourself
Now, you have my blessing, go your way

La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Happiness runs in a circular motion,
Falters like a little boat upon the sea
All our souls are deeper than you can see
You can have everything if you let yourself be
Everybody is a part of anything, anyway
You can have everything if you let yourself be

Happiness runs, happiness runs
Happiness runs, happiness runs
(3x)

Happiness runs in a circular motion,
Falters like a little boat upon the sea
All our souls are deeper than you can see
You can have everything if you let yourself be
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, let yourself be

Happiness runs, happiness runs
Happiness runs, happiness runs
