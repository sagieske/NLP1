Song:

What does she get for all the love she gave you?
They're on the latter of regret.

(Aaaaah! )
Mighty river, give her all she get!

What does she get for all the love she gave you?
They're on the latter of regret.
Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets

Where are the prices for the game she entered?
With little chance of much success
Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets

Come on river, overflow
That you love for the people show
Come on river, flow through me
That you love what the people feel

You are the river, I am a stream
Flow mighty river through me!

What does it pay to play the leading lady?
When life is dancing in distress

Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets

No less (no less), no more (no more)
No sleep (no sleep), no sure (no sure)
No sad (no sad), no pale (no pale)
No fairytale anymore

Come on river, flow through me
Don't be stopped by insanity
Come on river, overflow
That you love all your neighbours grow

You are the river, I am a stream
Flow mighty river through me!

Do, do, do...

Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets
Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets
Wowo!
Daytime nightime suffering, is all, she gets

What does she get for all the love she gave you?
