Song:

A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide
And both they soothed me in my sleep

For every season that has passed I prayed a prayer into the tide
A shining light in darkness deep
In me ten years before the mast

For every season that has passed I laid my body o'er the side
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide

How can I answer questions I've known?

A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
Ten years before the mast
I heard the ocean sing
