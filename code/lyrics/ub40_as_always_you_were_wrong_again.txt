Song:

We'll raise the price of parking fines
A boost for the economy
If that don't work we close the mines
And starve the poor of industry

We proved again we rule the waves
A blow for white democracy
That britains never shall be slaves
So long as they agree with me

We'll close the roads, divide the land
Put out the rage that burns within
Break the link of dirty hands
At any cost we'll always win

Keep them poor and wanting more
Deprive them of their basic rights
The hunger banging at their door
Will take away their will to fight

(chorus - answer)

As always you were wrong again
To us a little seems a lot
Don't turn your back on desperate men
Cause we can see how much you've got
