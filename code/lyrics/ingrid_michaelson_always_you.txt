Song:

I wait in the rain but I don’t complain because I wait for you
I don’t feel pain, you’re like novocain, and I got you

It was always you
It was always you

Time and again I thought that the end was just around the bend
You but showed me there’s more, I got more in store, and I got you

It was always you
It was always you

It was always you
It was always you
