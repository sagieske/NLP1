Song:

Am I dreaming such absurdities
I'm flying, and you're here with me
We fingerpaint the sky
Chase constellations sliding by
Connect their dots and dance on tightropes in between
We twirl and laugh about these crazy things we dream
And then I kiss you
And I wake myself
Still laughing

It's daybreak, and the whole world's new
The sun smiles, but where are you?
Wish I could hold you again
Nothing a daydream cannot mend
You smile and promise me you'll always be around
I whisper hallelu's and sing your name out loud
But no one hears me
Well, at least for now
I'm smiling

You can't write such a comedy
Without some conspiracy
Inside there's mutiny and mayhem
My secrets all want you to know them
I shed a tear because this love can never be
But as the saying goes it doesn't hurt to dream
As long as you know
That I find it all
So amusing
