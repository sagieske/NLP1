Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all I my n****s roll
Blowin dro on 24's,

[T. I.]
In a drop top chevy with the roof wide open my partners looking at me to see if my eyes open cause I've been drankin, and
I've
Been smokin and flying down 285 but I'm focused it's a four fifty four ss I race porches, white leather seats,
As fresh
As air forces I say I'm doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping number 8 on nwa straight out of Compton pull up at your
Partment sitting on 20 somthin's and the dope boys hollerin "hey what's hap..." the kid runnin in the clicks start dealing and the broads start
Choosing and the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
I sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood cause I
Ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood I'm use to it, so if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating 24 inch jays got the
Chevrolet shaking

[Chorus:]
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s know
24's,
That's how all my n****s roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s
Blowin dro on 24's,
That's how all my n****s roll

[T. I.]
I'll make a mill and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest at the age of seventeen, entertaining the rides, I want the best I
Refuse
To get a 9 to 5, I rather flip my keys been paying my dues since 89, trying to get my cheese diamonds gleam when I'm on the
Scene, they know it's me aint no dream or no fantasy b***h it's T I P brought busting, like a baby do a blanket I carry bbs' on my
Motherfucking pinkie, half of hennessy and belevedere what we dranking, pimps send for broads what the hell you n****s
Thinkin, y'all n****s spend a weekend in the islands in the fall, 24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm ballin I'm
Calling out shots like a pool shark my tools spark, when I fool y'all, y'all fools hard in the wrong place and the wrong time,
Got a strong mind to grab my chrome nine, and shoot at your a** for a long time but I'm a get that a**, all dog, f**k around
With
The click get shot like a d**k with a stick, cause yall lost cause I'm a ball at all costs, spit game at a dame, look
Around at this thang till she falls off

[Chorus:]
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s know
24's,
That's how all my n****s roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s know
24's,
That's how all my n****s roll

[T. I.]
I'm not bouncing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now I probably still be trappin if I wasn't rapping right now bragging
About pistols at the house, guess whos strapped right now keep a talking I'm a lay you on your back right now wanta act
Right now, get smacked right now, I'm a bankhead motherfucka I don't know to back down, clown down talking to your friends,
Talking about
What you making I'm 21 in 10 years deep, that s**t to me ain't nothing, getting played by the n****s getting head, for the
Change,
My lead wanta spray and your dead with decay, they ain't ready for the raidpay heavy for the yay, tell my class to kiss my
A**, I make a 11 everyday

[Chorus:]
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s roll
Blowin dro on 24's,
That's how all my n****s roll
Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my n****s roll
Blowin dro on 24's,
That's how all my n****s roll
