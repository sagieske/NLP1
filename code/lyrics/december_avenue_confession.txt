Song:

Can you open your eyes again
To see that I'm fallin in
Love with you
And see there is no end to this Line
I've been foolin you all around

I don't want us to be just friends
Well I'll open it up
And my heart just begins to melt right this time
I've seen you flew away
Inspite of this Confession there's nothing to say

What lies behind those eyes of you
There's billion of us that wave at you
So I'll stand bright and turn off their lights
Just to see me Through,
To see me through

Can you see that there is no end
For me cause I'm fallin'
In deeper now
And it seems that
I can't read through your mind

I don't want you to be alone
I just needed to see you face
Well I open it up
And my heart just begins to melt right this time

I'll show you through it all
And doctor all the Process
I need you to know

What Lies behind those eyes of you
There's billions of us that wave at you
So I'll stand bright and turn off their lights
Just to see me Through,
To see me... Through

I'll show you through it all
And doctor all the Process
I need you to know

What Lies behind those eyes of you
There's billions of us that wave at you
So I'll stand bright and turn off their lights
Just to see me Through,
To see me...

What Lies behind those eyes of you
There's billions of us that wave at you
So I'll stand bright and turn off their lights
Just to see me Through, To see me.
To see me Through. To see me
