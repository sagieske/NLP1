Song:

I look at you and I see
What I've been looking for
Now it's very clear to me
We should be together.
You make me feel I could reach
For the impossible
And knowing how much you care
I'll be there forever.

You know I'll beg
Steal or borrow
To give you sunny days
And in a hundred ways
I'll bring you love.
You know I'll beg
Steal or borrow
To make your garden grow
And most of all you know
I'll bring you love.

I always knew that the world
Could be a finer place
So what if I have to wait
Better late than never.
You you're like me you believe
Love makes it all worth while
And although we've just begun
We'll go on forever.

You know...
