Song:

(Verse)
Somebody's gotta wear a pretty skirt, 
Somebody's gotta be the one to flirt, 
Somebody gotta wanna hold his hand so God Made Girls
He needed something soft and loud and sweet and proud
But tough enough to break a heart
Something beautiful and breakable that lights up in the dark

(Chours)
So God made girls God made girls he stood back and told the boys
I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls (for singing in your front seat)
God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And God made girls.

(Hook)
Somebody's gotta be the one to cry
Somebody's gotta let him drive give him a reason
To hold that door so God made girls
Somebody's gotta make him get dressed up
Give him a reason to wash that truck
Somebody's gotta teach him how to dance
So god made girls
Someone that can wake him up and call his bluff
And drag his butt to church someone that is hard to hande
Somethin' fragile to hold him when he hurts

(Bridge)
So God made girls God made girls
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world and
God made girls (for singin' in your front seat)
God made girls (for dancin' to our own beat)
He stood back and told the boys I'm bout to rock your world
And god made girls

God made girls

So god made girls
