Song:

I follow you from town to town, I need it
I'm better off when you're around, I mean it
Sooner or later, things will all come around again
Sooner or later, I won't need anything, anything at all

I walk these streets alone at night when it hurts me
A perfect life's an oversight, you curse me
Should've known better than this esoteric love
Down to the letter, it don't mean anything, anything at all
Anything, anything at all

You and I
You and I

I wrestle with these guilty thoughts and I'm losing
You're all I am, I'm what you're not, confusing
Sooner or later, things will all come around for good
Sooner or later, I won't need anything, anything at all
Anything, anything at all
