Song:

The basic things are losing their value
And the pace of life is so complex
The people around me feel the pressure
But I'll remain forever young
They want more than they need and
They give more than they could bleed
They feel they're next in line yet I'll
Remain forever young

I control the hands of time- much to the
Majoritys dismay
If you'd leave me behind- I'm a picture
Painted in black and gray
But my colors are inside- when it's just
Too difficult to see
And I just feel alive- this means so much
To me

Young! Young! - holding on and taking
Grasp
- a vow that I will last
- I've learned so much from the past
- I'll remain forever young

It's not my age it's what I really know I
Can never be content
My commitment can't be measured
Because I'll remain forever young
Witness the hourglass slowly nearing
It's final grain
A lifetime to remember I'll remain forever
Young

When the rain has already stopped
Welcoming the sunshines warmth
In a world where right is wrong
When the fountain has already dried
