Song:

Black boots
Black boots
Black boots on

So you got my number
Flash that smile at me
You said this, I said that
When're we really gonna meet
I was lookin' sharp
Like the rollin' stones
And you kept talkin' about some party

[Chorus:]
You blowin' up my phone
Like where you at?
You wanna go, go, go
I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah
So I'm puttin' on
My favorite song
And black boots, black boots, black boots

Excuse me miss
How did it come to this
We were lovers undercover
And then you started talking about love
So we said goodbye
Everybody says goodbye
And I know you'll say hello again

[Repeat Chorus]

There's somethin' goin' down
You know where it's at
I need you now, now, now
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah
So I'm puttin' on
My favorite song
And black boots, black boots, black boots

I got my black boots
Black boots
Black boots on
I got my black boots
Black boots
I got my black boots
Black boots
Black boots on
I got my black boots
Black boots

Now you're turnin' up the song

[Repeat Chorus]

There's somethin' goin' down
You know where it's at
I need you now, now, now
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah
So I'm puttin' on
My favorite song
And black boots, black boots, black boots
Black boots, black boots, black boots

I got my black boots
Black boots...

I got my black boots
Black boots
Black boots on
I got my black boots
Black boots

Black boots
