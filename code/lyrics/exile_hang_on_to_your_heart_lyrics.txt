Song:

The band was playing, kinda, something low
All the lovers swaying, to and fro
You and me, together, dancing real slow

Tonight's the night, I want you to know
I can't hold out any longer
Remember, love can't grow
Oh, very much stronger

You better hang on to your heart, hold on tight
Or I'm gonna steal it away, tonight
I'll take you in my arms and never ever let you go

There's a new moon out, the stars are shining bright
You're here with me and it feels so right
So hang on to your heart
Or I'm gonna steal it away

You're living proof, that dreams come true
I can't believe, I'm really holding you
So close, so tight, all night through

If I could only make time stand still, forever
It'll always be
Just you and me
Here, together

You better hang on to your heart, hold on tight
Or I'm gonna steal it away, tonight
I'll take you in my arms and never ever let you go

There's a new moon out, the stars are shining bright
You're here with me and it feels so right
So hang on to your heart
Or I'm gonna steal it away

Hang on, hang on
Hang on to your heart
Hang on, hang on
Hang on to your heart

Hang on, hang on
Hang on to your heart
Hang on, hang on
Hang on to your heart
