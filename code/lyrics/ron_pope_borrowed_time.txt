Song:

I was watching as you were talking and day turned into dreams
Light keeps fading
Now we're both strangers as I fall to my knees

Come on and get me high

Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time
Tonight
I won't lie
We're living on borrowed time
Sinking slowly so it always feels like we'll never get out alive
Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time

Cold rain falling
These words get farther from what we really mean
Dust has settled your eyes towards heaven
The devil never sleeps

Come on and get me high

Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time
Tonight
I won't lie
We're living on borrowed time
Sinking slowly so it always feels like we'll never get out alive
Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time

We're living on borrowed time
We're living on borrowed time


Tonight
Tonight
Come on and get me high

Tonight
I won't lie
Come on and get me high

Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time
Tonight
I won't lie
We're living on borrowed time
Sinking slowly so it always feels like we'll never get out alive
Tonight
Tonight
We're living on borrowed time
