Song:

I Would walk 1, 000 miles
1, 000 miles it's true
I would walk 1, 000 miles
Just to be with You

[Chorus:]
'Cause you've got my heart and you've got my soul
Now you've got this promise too
Oh, I would walk 1, 000 miles
Just to be with You

If I write 10, 000 songs
10, 000 songs it's true
If I write 10, 000 songs
I'll Sing them all for you

[Chorus:]
'Cause you've got my heart and you've got my soul
Now you've got this promise too
If I could write 10, 000 songs
I'll Sing them all for you

And If I live 100 years
Before my life is through
And If I live 100 years
I'll spend them loving You

[Chorus:]
Cause You've got my heart and you've got my soul
Now you've got this promise too
If I could live 100 years
I'll spend them loving You

If I could live 100 years
I'll spend them loving You
