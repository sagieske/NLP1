Song:

Let me introduce meself,
Me name 'tis Paddy Green
I am me mammy's pride and joy
A fine oul' buachaillin!
I come from the county Waterford,
Near the village of Tramore,
I've been living at home since I was one,
And now I'm forty-four!

Chorus:
I was born to be a Bachelor,
I'll never walk down the aisle,
Me ma still makes me breakfast,
Livin' it up in style,
Girls, ye'll never catch me,
Stayin' single, is the plan
Born to be a Bachelor,
Sure I'm yer only man!

Well it's into town on the Saturday night,
Me and the boys go on a spree,
You can go down to the disco,
And have a drink with me!
With the ladies on the dance floor,
I'm a wild and crazy guy,
With me white socks and me black suede shoes,
And me thin red leather tie!

I was born to be a Bachelor,
I'll never walk down the aisle,
Me ma still makes me breakfast,
Livin' it up in style,
Girls, ye'll never catch me,
Stayin' single, is the plan
Born to be a Bachelor,
Sure I'm yer only man!

Then it's off to mass next morning,
I'm wearin' me Sunday best,
I've got no wife to fight with,
So I've no sins to confess!
After church, the married men
Go home, oh what a shame!
'Cause I'm scullin' da pints down at the pub
I'm watchin' the football game!

I was born to be a Bachelor,
I'll never walk down the aisle,
Me ma still makes me breakfast,
Livin' it up in style,
Girls, ye'll never catch me,
Stayin' single, is the plan
Born to be a Bachelor,
Sure I'm yer only man!

I'm a ramblin' ranter, I'm a rollin' stone,
I'm a galavanter' g'wan so leave me alone,
If yer out to get married, you'll get no joy,
Cause I was born and bred to be a bachelor boy!

Now up in Lisdoonvarna,
They've an old matchmaker's fair,
The girls all go a huntin'
So you'll never see me there!
I have a Russian sweetheart,
A fine oul' thing is she!
She's out in Vladivostok
And that's close enough for me!

I was born to be a Bachelor,
I'll never walk down the aisle,
Me ma still makes me breakfast,
Livin' it up in style,
Girls, ye'll never catch me,
Stayin' single, is the plan
Born to be a Bachelor,
Sure I'm yer only man!
