Song:

These pictures will go on and never end
I've ripped up the pages and gone through the stages again
So forget this notion, she will be here in the morning
Sickness, falling on family
She will get out of this hospital bed
And I could hear through the ocean's crashing cry
The Autumn calls her name tonite
He could feel the blood in her hands turn cold
As the mirror was broken
A story was told
These pictures will go on and never end
I've ripped up the pages and gone through the stages again
My fortune is failing
I thought I would be the one
The sun is scorching my splinters
She won't come out of this alive
And I could hear through the ocean's crashing cry
The Autumn calls her name tonite
He could feel the blood in her hands turn cold
As the mirror was broken
A story was told
These pictures go on and never end
I've ripped up the pages and gone through the stages again
Routinely fixing her hair
Walking thorugh the empty halls
She'll realize that nobody's there
Hear the Autumn call
I could hear through the ocean's crashing cry
The Autumn calls her name tonite
He could feel the blood in her hands turn cold
As the mirror was broken
A story was told
Routinely fixing her hair
Walking thorugh the empty halls
She'll realize that nobody's there
Hear the Autumn call
