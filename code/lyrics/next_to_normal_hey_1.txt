Henry:
Hey

Natalie:
Hey

Henry:
I've missed you these days,
I thought you might call.
It's been weeks...

Natalie:
I've been crazed.

Henry:
Hey, hey...
Have you been on the scene?
'Cause you look like a mess...

Natalie:
Thanks, I guess.

Henry:
Are you clean?

Natalie:
Well coming from you...

Henry:
I don't do what you do.

Natalie:
Ok, how did it start?

Henry:
But you took it too far.

Natalie:
Oh, I took it too far.

Henry:
Hey! Hey!

Natalie:
Henry, don't!
Don't do this to me!

Henry:
Are we over?
Don't say that we're over.

Natalie:
Don't you want us to be?

Henry:
No, I want who I knew.
She's somewhere in you.
Hey, say...
Will you come to this dance?
It's some spring formal dance...
It's March 1st, and it's cheese.
But it's fun and it's free...

Natalie:
I don't do dances.

Henry:
Do this dance with me?

Natalie:
Goodbye, Henry.
