[Verse 1: Noonie Bao]
Where's the light, still dark when I close my eyes
We tried but the feeling's gone
Summer nights, a beating heart will confuse your mind
We tried but the feeling's gone

[Hook: Noonie Bao]
I remember when the beat was slow
And we got down low to Rihanna on the stereo
All of the things that we used to know
Back in 2006, oh yeah
Close your eyes and I will take you there
Oh... 

[Verse 2: Noonie Bao]
Save your love, save all of he hurting too
We tried but the feeling's gone
You were mine, but I'll never wish rewind
We tried but the feeling's gone

[Hook 2: Noonie Bao]
I remember when the beat was slow
And we got down low to Nirvana on the stereo
All of the things that we used to know
Back in 1996, oh yeah
Close your eyes and I will take you there
Oh... 

[Intermission]

[Verse 3: Noonie Bao]
Search for days, in light, life makes you blind
We tried but the feeling's gone
Rest your mind cause I know we are fine
We tried but the feelings gone

[Hook: Noonie Bao]
I remember when the beat was slow
And we got down low to Rihanna on the stereo
All of the things that we used to know
Back in 2006, oh yeah
Close your eyes and I will take you there
Oh... 

[Hook 2: Noonie Bao]
I remember when the beat was slow
And we got down low to Nirvana on the stereo
All of the things that we used to know
Back in 1996, oh yeah
Close your eyes and I will take you there
Oh...
