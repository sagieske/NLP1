Song:

I asked my love to take A walk,
To take A walk, just A little walk,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the old ohio.

And only say that you'Ll be mine
In no others arms entwine,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the old ohio.

I held A knife against her brest
As ino my arms she pressed,
She cried, "oh, willie, don'T murder me,
I'M not prepeared for eternity. "

And only say that you'Ll be mine
In no others arms entwine
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the old ohio

I started home 'Tween twelve and one,
I cried, "my god, what have I done?
Killed the only woman I loved,
Because she would not be my bride. "

And only say that you'Ll be mine
In no others arms entwine,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the old ohio.
