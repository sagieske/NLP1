Song:

What do you think about the man that never came, caught
in his own bad game under a new name. You're no better
cause you don't feel s**t, you moan and whine until you get
another hit. So what's with the new style. I'll f**k you up and
wait for a new trial. Oh my you think your made you got
you're first laid, can't you see it makes you hate. So step
the f**k back we ain't no joke say what you want you got no
hope f**k Tony Montana we got more dope to spread
around, f**k around, wake up with your nuts bound to my
bedpost ky jelly I'll be your perverted host. Lyrical mass
murderer slitting your throat cutting you up and then bury ya.
Better hurry yall. It's time we took the glow off slap you in
the face
grab your balls and make you cough.

They call you Puto m**********r. They call you Puto
m**********r.

It's all crap, a trap, and no way out. It's no use to talk if you
can't scream it out loud. You don't believe you won't hear it,
you don't wanna beat it, you don't wanna act unless you
fear it. F**k you punk you don't stand a chance, the four of
us are back and it's no f*****g switchstance. You better
like it or love it man. Now tell me what you think. Cause this
one I gotta win now put me back in.

They call you Puto m**********r. They call you Puto
m**********r.
