Song:

All I am is the bones you made for me
So garishly clean
White as the horses, that carry me away
And all my demons, you said, come and go with a days
A mind's will to play 
I grow old in my way.
Just like you do.

Oh there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, just to be clear
So be clear, be clear.

All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses, that carry me away.
That carry me away.

Oh there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, be clear
Oh there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh oh oh ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh oh oh ain't no way to say I love you more, mama
So be clear, just to be clear
So be clear, be clear.

Oh there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
No there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh there ain't no way to say I love you more
So be clear, be clear
