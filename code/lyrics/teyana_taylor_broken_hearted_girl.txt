[Verse: Teyana Taylor]
Boys are you looking at me, looking at you?
I already know what you want, cause I want that s**t too

It don't matter if you're single, single
Either way I just wanna take you home, take you home
And it don't matter if you got a past, got a past
Cause I ain't got nothing to do with that, do with that, do with that

[Hook:] (x2)
I wanna love you
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now

See we ain't gotta waste time going on all [?]
We ain't gotta count pills when you come to my place
We ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta), you ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta) You ain't gotta, (you ain't gotta)
Cause I want you right now
All night
