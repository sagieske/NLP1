Song:

I ain't no doctor, I ain't no doctor's son,
But I'll fill your prescription,
Till the real doctor comes,
Till the real doctor comes.

I ain't no sailor, ain't no sailor's son,
But I'll be your navigator,
Till the marines hit town,
Till the marines hit town.

I'm a handyman, an all around man,
I'm a handyman, all around man,
And when your husband comes,
That's when the handyman's gonna scram.

I ain't the da, ain't the da's son,
But I'll talk to the jury,
And I'll see justice done.

Handyman, I'm a handyman,
An all around man, all around man.

I ain't no astronaut,
From Cape Kennedy I don't come.
Just step inside my rocket ship,
I'll take you circling round the sun.

We'll head off for Pluto, Venus and Mars,
Step inside, baby, I'll take you very far.

I'm a handyman, an all around man,
An all around man, an all around man,
And when your husband comes,
That's when the handyman is gonna scram.
