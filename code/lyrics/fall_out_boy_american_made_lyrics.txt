Song:

When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass
Now I know they'll never last
And I just want my childhood back
I just want my childhood [?]
I just wanna take it back

[?]
All american made
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame
[?]
All american made
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame

Huh
When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass
Now I know they'll never last
And I just want my childhood back
I just want my childhood [?]
I, I just wanna take it back

[?]
All american made
Let's see who burns the truest in the flames, yeah
