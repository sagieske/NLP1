Verse 1:(Lil kim aka big momma)
The Buda got my brain seein my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin my remains, it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat, now she ain't there
I'm seein b*****s in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find
See a little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a b***h wanna choke me till I bleed
Now watch a b***h breathe from dum-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect, now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he wants my cash
The Lexus and rings, give a s** simple and plain
But these b*****s is mad an' they n****s is bad
So they scheme on a cream, you know
F**k the hos, b*****s is detrimental, the guns is essential

Chorus x 2

Verse 2:(Lil kim)
I'm having re-occuring dreams-b*****s they want my cream
They wanna be lieutenant so it seems, I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin round and round my bed
The shadow stops, points a Glock to my fuckin head
I grab my pillow, crack the back window
Pull out the tre-8, bust three times at the gate
Lord have mercy! The devil tryin to curse me
I keeps seeing s**t that wasn't there in the first
See b*****s be livin mad fad-they f**k my man
Steal out my crib, then come an' try an' shake my hand
Yeah man, breakin you down one time
I packs that s**t for your a**, Chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you b*****s, I wish you keep your mind
Off my motherfuckin riches
B*****s, I'm tired of all you hos beggin me for clothes
Bank rolls is all I knows, that s**t is dead chicken-head!

Chorus x 2

Verse 3:(Lil kim)
The morning's finally here, damn! What should I wear?
Time to get dressed and do my hair, once again it's on
Somebody's knockin at my door, but when I walk across the floor
Just ope' it up, the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearing voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my 2, 'cause this fool might get outta line
I guess it's time to test this bullet-proof dress
From putting holes up in my chest
I'm lookin through the peep-hole to recognise the face
I see three b*****s and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy, but when I open the door
Three little girls selling candy, ya see b*****s is jealous
Of Little Kim because my click is thicker than the rest of them
All I wanna do is be rich and stay that b***h
Clock dough on the law, y'know?

Chorus to fade
