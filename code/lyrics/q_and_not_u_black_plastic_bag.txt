Song:

Who's paying your mortgage?
Daddy's dying.
Daddy's dying.
Daddy's dying, today.
Throw yourself on the body.
Sharp teeth, sharp teeth.
Take out your sharp teeth.
Who's paying your mortgage?
Daddy's dying.
Daddy's dying.
Daddy's dying.
Line your lungs with noise then just sew it up.
In and out, in and out, it is like this, like this, it is like a fist.
In and out, in and out, it is like this, like this, it is like a fist.
In and out, in and out, it is like this, like this, it is like a fist.
In and out, in and out, it is like this, like this, it is like a fist.
You want the questions you got your answers down.
You want the answers, you got the face fleshed out.
The air is full of harmonies but is anyone even sleeping right?
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower, don't worry.
Every town gets an Eiffel Tower tonight.
Everyone is sleeping under one tonight.
