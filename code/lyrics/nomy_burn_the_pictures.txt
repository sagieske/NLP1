Song:

Hey you, believe it or not
But I find you pretty attractive, hey!
I guess you don't know who I am
And that's ok, 'cause I don't give a damn,
That's right

So what's your name
Am I insane
If I call you baby
Right now for the first time
I wanna wake up with you every f*****g day

Burn the pictures from yesterday
I thought I loved you, but my hate is in the way
This is the hour when I regret
Everything I promised you is not what you will get

You're lying next beside me
Breathing silently
My conscience catches up
Like always, killin' me

How about people
Leaving me alone
'Cause every god damn day I try to love them
But I feel I'm doing wrong

How should I live
This life
Now when I know
That I am lost inside of me
How should I live
My life
Now when I know
That I am dead inside

Burn the pictures from yesterday
I thought I loved you but my hate is in the way
This is the hour when I regret
Everything I promised you is not what you will get

(Yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!)
Burn the pictures from yesterday
I thought I loved you but my hate is in the way
This is the hour when I regret
Everything I promised you is not what you will get

So burn the pictures from yesterday
I thought I loved you but my hate is in the way
This is the hour when I regret
Everything I promised you is not what you will get

Burn the pictures (burn the pictures)
Burn the pictures!
