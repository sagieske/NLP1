Song:

Lord we come
With our hearts wide open
Lord we know
You have made us one
Lord
We are waiting
Anticipating
We are creating
A place for you

Lord we come
With our hearts wide open
Lord we know
You have made us one
Lord
We are waiting
Anticipating
We are creating
A place for you

My desire
Is to see
A move of God
A move in me
My desire
Is to do
All the things
He's showing me
Let us create
Create a place
Release your faith
Releasing faith
For God to move
So we will see
The power of God
And we will know
That he is God

We open our hearts to you

Lord we come
With our hearts wide open
Lord we know
You have made us one
Lord
We are waiting
Anticipating
We are creating
A place for you

My desire
Is to see
A move of God
A move in me
My desire
Is to do
All the things
He's showing me
Let us create
Create a place
Release your faith
Releasing faith
For God to move
So we will see
The power of God
And we will know
That he is God

Let us create
Create a place
Releasing faith
For God to move
So we will see
The power of God
And we will know
That he is God

Let us create
Create a place
Releasing faith
For God to move
So we will see
The power of God
And we will know
That he is God
