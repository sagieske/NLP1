Song:

I'm flying down the fast lane, 
Doing ninety-five, ninety things on my brain.
Don't know where the hell I'm going, 
But, I'm going after you.

I'm jumping on the last train, 
With the crazy kind of feeling that I can't explain.
Don't know where the hell I'm going, 
But, I'm going after you.

And I know you think I'm crazy, 
And I dress up like I'm four, 
I don't do dinner and movies, 
But, if I showed up at your door.

Would you give me one more minute, 
The story's far from finished, 
We could fill in all the pages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

Just wanna say I miss you, 
I caught it when I kissed you, 
And I've been through all the stages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

It was raining on a Wednesday, 
Doing ninety-five, ninety things left to say.
Told myself to keep on driving, 
'Cause I left my heart with you.

I never thought that I could walk away, 
Every second I'm regrettin' that I didn't stay.
How could I just keep on driving, 
When I left my heart with you.

You think all my friends are crazy, 
And I know you hate my car.
But, while I don't drive a Mercedes, 
Would it be that hard?

To just give me one more minute, 
The story's far from finished, 
We could fill in all the pages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

Just wanna say I miss you, 
I caught it when I kissed you, 
And I've been through all the stages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

How can I get a second chance?
I don't want you slippin' out my hands, 
Maybe the words will come out right, 
They sound alright.

S-S-S-So Contagious! 

Just hear me out before I go, 
Things that I wanted you to know.
Just let me in tonight, 
And I will let you go.

S-S-S-So Contagious! 

Would you give me one more minute, 
The story's far from finished, 
We could fill in all the pages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

Just wanna say I miss you, 
I caught it when I kissed you, 
And I've been through all the stages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

Would you give me one more minute, 
The story's far from finished, 
We could fill in all the pages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

Just wanna say I miss you, 
I caught it when I kissed you, 
And I've been through all the stages.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.

I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.
I'm feeling sick, 
Girl, you're so contagious.
