Song:

I used to get awf’ly moody, when dating a fair-skinned cutie
‘Cause every red-hot beauty turned out to be bitchy inside
Like something had crawled right up her a** and died

But then I met you, my troubles were through
I whispered, “I do”, and promised I’d stay in love with you
The day I met you, you know that I knew
You’d be a great s***w, thank God I met you

With parents so agitating, my way of retaliating
Was one little rule of dating, give mommy and daddy a fright
I slept with a different black guy every night

But then I met you, my troubles were through
I whispered, “I do”, and promised I’d stay in love with you
The day I met you, you know that I knew
My world was brand new, thank God I met you

Knowing our happiness is always growing
Is all I need to keep me going
Your smile has me deep in a trance
I’m all about romance

Freakin’ show off

We hoped it would last, but could it?
We hoped it would grow, but would it?
I gave you my love and put it
All over your face and your hair
I never imagined I could walk on air

But then I met you, my troubles were through
I whispered, “I do”, and promised I’d stay in love with you
The day I met you, you know that I knew
My world was brand new, thank God I met you
Thank God I met you, thank God I met you
