Song:

Female flies in a plastic glass
Take the Waltz with ice cube boys
How long it's anybody's guess
It's just a suicide toy in a bony hand
Pistol in a bony hand
Lies in hiding down below
We could do with some bang bang bang
To end the big old bang
To end the jingle show
Cast your eyes around the room
You might see a single man
He's a puppet doll of the king of fools
He's gonna blow up now
With a big old bang
It's all around a passing show
Just like a cigarette
Or all those melting ice cube boys
And the female flies in a plastic glass
Hey bang bang bang, big old bang
Just dance me to an endless joy
Dance with me I'll pay the band...
