Song:

From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the devil
After all the dust had settled

There's an hourglass of time
Counting down all of the lies
And with every grain of sand
Time is slipping through my hands

Oh! I sold my soul to rock n roll
I let my demons take control
Redemption seems so far away
This microphone is my escape

Don't mess with Ouija Boards
Cause now my spirits soared

I'm bound by fear of being trapped
I'm falling faster, fade to black
Something's standing in my way
Hoping for better days

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality
Oh! 

I spill my heart out on the stage
The only way I feel okay
And right before that curtain calls
I've just got one more thing to say

Don't mess with Ouija Boards
Cause now my spirits soared

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality
Oh! 

From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the devil
After all the dust had settled

Look into my eyes
You will see the light
It burns to blind
This way we'll never die
I speak the truth
Immortalized by you
No other way
Until my final day

Oh, I feel the hate
Boiling up inside
And it's too late
Nowhere to run and hide! 

Don't mess with Ouija Boards
Don't mess with Ouija Boards

I'm bound by fear of being trapped
I'm falling faster, better days

I'm always searching
For serenity (better days)

I'm always searching
For serenity
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality

Don't mess with ouija boards
Ouija boards
Don't mess with Ouija boards
