Song:

{Verse 1}
she was light, bright, damn near white
wit dem, chinese eyes, and big girl thighs
and it was, so many rumors, and so many lies
about my, so many girls, and so many wives
that it, broke up my home, she left me alone
and i was tryin to explain to her on the phone
but im like what was the use of tellin the truth
plus i was, trained at a youth to do what i do
so i just tell her some lies to make her feel good
like, one day im movin you out the hood
it went from kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but dat was all a part of F**kin wit thugs

{chorus 2x}
if you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you f**k wit a nigga fo'real then it aint nothing to keepin it trill

{Verse 2}
she just, wanted to smile and wanted a child
but i was ruining her dreams by livin too wild
she said i need to calm down and act like a man
and my response was like what the f**k is u sayin
cuz i was, so caught up into movin it white, and i was gone 24/7 a night
and i didnt give a f**k if i was wrong or was right
cuz i was a d-boi livin a d-boi's life
and she was a school girl slash d-boi's wife
and it was in wit the wrong and out wit the right
cuz she was trafficin' and manufacturin drugs
but that was all apart of f**kin wit thugs

{chorus 2x}
if you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you f**k wit a nigga fo'real then it aint nothing to keepin it trill

{Verse 3}
we was tighter then fam, cooler than friends
we thought it would last 4ever and never would end
and we'd get mad at each other and try to pretend
like we was callin it quits, wasnt speakin again
we went our seperate ways fo a couple of days
you know the seperate phase fo' hell of some days
but uh i regret ever doin her friend
but it was the need of the moment and u know us men
we just think wit out actin my man was back trackin but still i say what i mean and mean what i say cuz im real so play ya position and show us some love cuz that was all a part of f**kin wit thugs

{chorus 2x}
if you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you f**k wit a nigga fo'real then it aint nothing to keepin it trill
