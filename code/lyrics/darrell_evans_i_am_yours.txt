Song:

Not one thing do I want more
Than only to love you, lord
I just wanna please you, I want
You to know, I am yours

This one thing my heart longs for
To be closer to you lord, I just wanna
Please you and I want you to know, I am yours

Oh.....
I am yours
Oh.......
I am yours

I am yours, I am yours
Everything I am, everything I have
I am yours, I am yours
My heart and soul, my mind and strength
I am yours, I am yours
Everything I am, everything I have
I am yours, I am yours
My heart and soul, my mind and strength
(repeat)
I am yours, lord
