Song:

A girl's work is never done
You boys think we are having fun
Mopping and sweeping up the floor
Uh oh, the salesmen's at the door

Never done, never done
A girl's work is never done

Wash up the windows and the blinds
Aw, heck, the rain, a waste of time
And now the kids are home from school
They're tracking mud from room to room

You think it's fun, it's never done
A girl's work is never done

And now my father's home from work
With fifteen hundred dirty shirts
You think he'd help me clean the house
He says he's tired and knocked out
(Yeah, man, I'm beat)

While I cook, he reads a book
A girl's work is never done

My baby brother's now in bed
Lullaby and goodnight
I need an aspririn for my head
There in the living room, Pop sleeps
That means the dog I've got to feed

Never done, never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
A girl's work is never done
