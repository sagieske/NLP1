Song:

We walk through the doorway,
Heard you calling from the hall,
To find you in the bedroom,
Not breathing at all.
I drug your body to the cellar where we lay,
The wax it melts away, I kiss your face...

Now we are starting to love you more,
Your body's on the canvas,
I painted on the floor.

Now you wait, like the drug,
Like the change in the pain it goes on, for so long,
And oh, now it hurts in the worst way,
Now that you're gone,
It's so wrong, it's so wrong...

If I could take you somewhere,
I'd take you to the darkest place,
Scatter you in art forms,
Admire the w***e,
Beauty in different ways,
Your hands on picture frames,
Your eyes in the glass,
Wear your face as a mask,

Now they are starting to love you more,
A gallery of your beauty,
No charge at the door.

As you wait, like the drug,
Like the change in the pain it goes on, for so long,
And oh, now it hurts in the worst way,
Now that your gone,
It's so wrong, it's so wrong...

And down below,
Your veins run dry, your vacant eyes;
I lost control,
Your face is pale, your body's cold;
And down below
Your veins run dry, your vacant eyes;
I lost control,
Your face is pale, your body's cold...
(Face is pale, your body's cold...)

Wait, like the drug,
Like the change in the pain it goes on, for so long,
And oh, now it hurts in the worst way
Now that your gone,
It's so wrong, it's so wrong...

It's so wrong... [x9]
