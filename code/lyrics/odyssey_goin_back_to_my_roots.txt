Song:

Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots
Yeah

To the place of my birth
Back down to earth.

I've been standing in the rain

Drenched and soaked with pain

Tired of short time benefits
And being exposed to the elements.
I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around.

Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots
Yeah

To the place of my birth
Back down to earth.
Ain't talkin' 'bout no roots in the land

Talkin' 'bout the roots in the man.
I feel my spirit gettin' old
It's time to recharge my soul
I'm zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots
Yeah

To the place of my birth
Back down to earth.

Zippin' up my boots
Goin' back to my roots.
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth.
