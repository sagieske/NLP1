Song:

Imma get on my sorta emo s**t on this one, gonna vent a little, I hope you
Don't mind.
Yeah, listen.

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

See I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

I wish I had a time machine
To change the way my mind perceives everythin' my eyes have seen
And make me look at life through a wider screen
It ain't what you might believe's happenin' behind the scenes
I treat the beat like an X-ray
Press play looking inside
The best way to express pain
F*****g up is becomin' somethin' I'm used to
Cos sometimes to find yourself you gotta lose you
To those listenin' sorry for bein' emo
But f**k what the doctor says
This is what I need though
Yeah, and so I'm walkin' into that cloud
Where it has to hurt just to bring you back down

Almost became addicted to the painkillers
Cos without that feelin' yo the pain's killer
You'd think having a near death experience'd
Make a smart person take their life more serious
From nearly diein' to feelin' so enlightened
To nearly cryin' and feelin' only frightened
Releasin' this is hard yo it fu***n' hurts a bit
It's the only way I know how to come to turns with it
And this is Matt here I'm givin' you the real me
I just hope that you can feel me

And I know you're probably thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cos it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

And with the partyin' I think I need to settle down
To be real I'm gettin' a little messy now
A few drinks and stressin' out in another state
Looking for my mum to come and get me out
I've got no idea when I'm coming home
And all I want is to be left the f**k alone
I'm only being real the depression comes and goes
Ignore it cos tonight there is yet another show

Looking in the mirror like what the f**k am I starin' at?
Not recognizin' the brittle mess that is staring back
So I'm givin' you the deepest s**t you ever hear
So if you've got time for Matthew then lend an ear
I'm just hopin' that I've said it clear
If I stay on this path the end for 360 is gettin' near

I know you're thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cos it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

I see my mates like my brothers yo
I hardly see 'em anymore
The last time was a month ago
They either workin' or gettin' in relationships
I should do that too but yo I hate this s**t
Don't get me wrong yo I love women
With what I see though it makes it hard for me to put my trust in 'em
All it takes is one person to fail you
And then you feel like majority will fail too
My insecurities will swallow me whole
And when they arise yo I'm not in control
They watchin' every move and they move with me
Like "Look at that dude 60, that motherfuckers's too skinny."

I can handle friends tellin' me I'm underweight
But from a stranger it's somethin' that I fu***n' hate
I know you're unaware that shit's a low blow
But you feel the need to tell me like you think I don't know?
No, that's rude, find a bridge and jump off
And if I tell you to f**k off then f**k off
That's not bein' immature about it
That's me admittin' I'm insecure about it
And yo I'm sorry if I'm seemin' insane
But I wrote this while I was at the peak of the pain

But now it's got me thinkin' I should keep it to myself
But I can't yo I need it cos it helps

I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?

So I hope you don't mind if I spill my pain
The longer that I don't is like I'm goin' insane
Can I let it all out?
Can I let it all out?
