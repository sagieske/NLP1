Song:

La da da dum dum dum
La da da dum

What do you know? I went and got myself all in a mess, 
Get a little invest, you're not gonna mess it up this time.
Here we go, yes is now, I'm melting us together, 
I'm feeling a little bit crazy, I'm thinking that maybe 
I could blow your mind, 
If that's all right.

I'd love to take you away from here, 
Hold on and magically disappear.
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.

Who would've known that I could ever feel this way?
You're miles away, unless you say 'I'm with you today, where you are! '
I'll meet you oh so very far, so grab your guitar and jump in my car, 
Alone and away, yeah.
That's okay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ayy

I'd love to take you away from here, 
Hold on and magically disappear.
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.
Take all of me, hold on tight.
This time, I swear that we'll do it right.
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.

I'd love to take you away from here, 
Hold on and magically disappear.
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.

I'd love to take you away from here, 
Hold on and magically disappear.
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.
Take all of me, hold on tight.
This time, I swear that we'll do it right. 
It's all the rush from the inside out, 
A feeling I couldn't breathe without.

Ohhh, I couldn't breathe without.
Ohhh, woah, I couldn't breathe without.
