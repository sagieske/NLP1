Amazingly Beautiful Creatures Dancing
Exite the Forest Glade.
In my Heart I do
Jump like Kangaroo do
Listening to the Music
So Nicely Organ Played.
Quietly Rest the
Sleeping Tiger
Under the Vines by the Waterside
X-marks-the-spot 'neath the
Yellow moon where the
Zulu chief and I do hide
(Hey nan ay)
(From memory, I may have botched it some)
