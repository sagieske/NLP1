Song:

Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea But I'll take with 
Me the warmth of thee A taste of honey A taste much 
Sweeter than wine
He will return He will return He'll come back For the 
Honey and me 
I'll leave behind my heart to wear And may it e'er remind 
You of A taste of honey A taste much sweeter than wine
He will return He will return He'll come back For the 
Honey and me
