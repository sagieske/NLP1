Song:

[Verse: Soloist]
I've had some problems
Some great and some small
You being God
Delivered me from them all
Still can't believe
All the ways you've made
An incredible God deserves incredible praise

Oh Lord Oh

[Verse: Choir]
I've had some problems
Some great and some small
You being God
Delivered me from them all
Still can't believe
All the ways You've made
An incredible God deserves incredible praise

[Chorus: Choir]
What kind of God
Would do this for me?
Victory, 
Grace and mercy, 
He is so special, 
Simply incredible, 
He's so incredible, 

An incredible God deserves incredible praise
[X3 and modulate]

[Soloist:]
Oh, oh, oh, o-o-oh, oh, oh, oh

Praise, 
Incredible, 
Praise, 
Incredible
Praise, 
He deserves, 
Incredible
