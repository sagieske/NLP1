Song:

Funny how you never know
Where your heart is gonna go
Suddenly you're being pulled into a rising undertow
What started as a little rain
Grows into a hurricane
Riding on a wave
Desire flowing, crashing through your veins
What you want, I know
What you need

[Chorus:]
I think you need a little push in my direction if you're gonna fall in love
All you need's a little nudge and I will catch you when you fall
I think it's only fair to bring to your attention
You're about to fall in love
Yes, you're gonna fall in love

You're opening a different door
Curious to know the score
But so afraid that once inside you won't
Be leaving anymore
And while your hesitation burns
You're gonna be surprised to learn
How easy it'll be to get you to
The point of no return
What you want, I know
What you need

[Chorus:]

You fear love that's real love
Expecting ideal love
It's hard to conceal love
Deny what you feel, love, you feel love

[Chorus:]
