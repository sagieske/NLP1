Song:

Clear air and sparkling city
Crisp cloud lines crystal pretty
Wind sweeps the streets and swirl by lovers
Strolling through their own world
Basking in each others glow
While I wander lonely
I hear the church bells ringing
Mixed choirs of Sunday singing
I wander down the sidewalk
Wondering wondering what will spring be
Whether spring will comfort me
While I wander lonely
Soon I'll find a change
Watching hours pass I walk away the day
Hiding from the room where my memory keeps
Replaying scenes
Of shattered dreams
Cars pass reflective windows
Night falls and still the wind blows
I turn to home and think tomorrow
That's the day I'll meet her
That's the day my love will turn
While I wander lonely.
