Song:

(Sloan/Barri)

She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

You'll think she's a prize at the start (prize at the start)
But take my advice, play it smart (just play it smart)
She's nothin' but trouble
Better cut out on the double
Before she gets into your heart

She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

When you stare into her pretty blue eyes (into her eyes)
There's no way to see through her disguise (through her disguise)
But don't try to love her 'cause you'll quickly discover
You're trapped in the web of her lies

She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

Her lips look inviting it's true (oh yes that's true)
But lots of other guys have felt like you do (felt like you do)
She'll build up your hopes and when you need her the most
That's when she'll say goodbye to you

She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me
