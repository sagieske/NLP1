Song:

What's your excuse for living like
You're somebody different

You're nobody different
You're just somebody

Tell me what's the reason behind
All your frustrations

It's a bad situation

Can you trust me

Do you think that maybe you live your
Life in circles

Going round in circles

Heading nowhere

Talk about it, live without it

If you wanna sort it out you gotta
Come on and talk about it, live without it

What's your excuse for living like

You're somebody different

You're nobody different
You're just somebody
