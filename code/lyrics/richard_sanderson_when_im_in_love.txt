Song:

You, I'm feeling lost in front of you
I really think It's something new
I'm feeling insecure with you
My love

You, could make me happy in the rain
I'll stand outside your window pane
Then I'll wait for you to show

I'm in love, I'm in love
In a very foolish way
I'm in love, I'm in love
Even if it lasts a day

I'm in love, I'm in love
But she didn't want to stay
Oh, my life can keep on going
But it will not be the same
Than with your love

Sad, I think I've lost you now for good
If anything to try I would
I keep on thinking I'm a fool

You, I tried as many things I could
I'd like to be made out of wood
And wouldn't feel the bitter taste

I'm in love, I'm in love
In a very foolish way
I'm in love, I'm in love
Even if it lasts a day

I'm in love, I'm in love
But she didn't want to say
Oh, my life can keep on going
But it will not be the same

I'm in love, I'm in love
In a very foolish way
I'm in love, I'm in love
Even if it lasts a day

I'm in love, I'm in love
But she didn't want to say

Oh, my life can keep on going
But it will not be the same
Than with your love

When I'm in love,
When I'm in love.
