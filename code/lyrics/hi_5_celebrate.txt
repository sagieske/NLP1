Song:

Stop what you're doing
Right away
There's no time to work
Cause it's time to play
Grab your dancing shoes
And your party hat
Come along and join us
Get to where it's at

There's no need to wait
Let's Celebrate
Hurry, don't be late
Let's Celebrate

Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Hurry, don't be late
C'mon and celebrate

Life is a party
And we're all here
There's plenty of laughter
And plenty of cheer
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your party hat
Feel your body move
This is where it's at

There's no need to wait
Let's Celebrate
Hurry, don't be late
Let's Celebrate

Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Hurry, don't be late
C'mon and celebrate

Everybody everywhere
Wave your arms up in the air
Everybody everywhere
Come with us and...

Celebrate
Celebrate
Celebrate
Hurry, don't be late
C'mon and celebrate
