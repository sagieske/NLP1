Song:

Settle in, won't you all take a seat?
Welcome here to the land of deceased.

You breathe in, you breathe out, it all feels the same.
You feel alive but there's no blood in your veins.
Confess to us the fable of previous life,
In life and in death I'll show you how our souls survive!

Rest, rest in peace dear deceased and tell us all your stories.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
It's hard to make a sound when you're all fallen asleep,
Caught in dream far from reality.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
Cause it's all over now.

Understand, open your eyes and you'll see,
I'm not here to judge you and I'm not here to preach.
My role here is to guide you as we search through your past,
So let's all get started, we're to get her at last!

Each of you left a loved one behind,
How long do you expect them to live on and survive?!

Council of the dead!
Who do you expect will be joining us next?
Live your life without fear of regret,
Cause one you're dead there's no point to lament!

I know this all may be hard to believe,
The sooner you accept it, the sooner you'll see.
Your relativity is buried beneath,
Your deaths are the lock, but your lives are the key!

Rest, rest in peace dear deceased and tell us all your stories.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
It's hard to make a sound when you're all fallen asleep,
Caught in dream far from reality.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
Cause it's all over now.

Everybody, sit and listen, there are some things I think you should know,
Before your destiny's decided, you must reveal where you come from.
Loved ones and broken hearted you left behind to suffer,
Now you're gone!

Let's hope in life that you provided,
The means to live and carry on.
Tell me now what's more important,
Time in life or time now that you're gone?

Buried you in cemetery,
Above your family surrounds.
Try to scream their name out loud,
But it's hard to make a sound now!

Council of the dead (Council of the dead!).
Who do you expect will be joining us next?
Live your life without fear of regret,
Cause one you're dead there's no point to lament!

Rest, rest in peace dear deceased and tell us all your stories.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
It's hard to make a sound when you're all fallen asleep,
Caught in dream far from reality.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
(Cause it's all over now!)
Rest, rest in peace dear deceased and tell us all your stories.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
It's hard to make a sound when you're all fallen asleep,
Caught in dream far from reality.
Scream, shout, let it out (Scream, shout, let it out!)
Cause it's all over now.
