Song:

Unlearn me
Ditch what I read
Behind what I heard

Look Find Free
Yet? Do you get it yet?
Do you get it?
From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map of...
It all!
It all!

Evidence
In the march of the ant
Pulse of the sea

Look Find Free
Yet? Do you get it yet?
Do you get it?
From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map of it all! It all!
Out of line and indivisible
A crow left of the murder
Every piece contains a map of it all

Everything I wanted, wanted to know
Everything I wanted, wanted to see

Unlearn me
Do you get it yet?
Look, find, free
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
