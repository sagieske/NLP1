Song:

It's a story, but that's why I'm here to tell you stories, so picture the scene.

Let's begin

The turn of the day
When all music fools come out to play
Until the drunk turn of night

So many stories to hear
So many chicks to greet
And beautiful faces unseen

So many stories to hear
So many chicks to greet
And beautiful faces unseen

What they were building? No one could say

Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!

At the turn of the night
We all wonder and chuckle in the lights
Until every floor is sought through

Such crazy behaviors
Such noise in our ears
Let's all change gears

Such crazy behaviors
Such noise in our ears
Let's all change gears

If we you really need to express something
But I don't know what it is I want to express...
Or how to express it?

Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!

Before this night ends
I will mingle and find you
Until your hand is in my hand

So much sweat and laughter
So much for electric beats
And spark when you come so sweet

So much sweat and laughter
So much for electric beats
And spark when you come so sweet

Thank you for a lovely evening
Good night, it's been charming

At the turn of the day
When words become syllables
Will you remember our dance?

I ask myself that question all the time

At the turn of the day
When words become syllables
Will you remember our dance?

Ah! You remember that?
Something I should never forget
