Song:

Feels like living in a dream
From which I cannot wake
Voices leading me astray
Cannot hide

Feels like I am growing weaker
I can't deny
Whatever's hurting me
Won't leave me
Here at ease
And I can see your secrecy
Has gone away

In another time
You left me
For someone else
Who'd serve your every needs
And set your
World apart
The strain is now
Unbearable, 
Turned me to stone

For all the hardship in my way
Hold on, move on

Hear me! 
How hide your face while you carry on 'till the grief comes
Save your soul from the downfall

To give and take was not an option
You have to run and sweep it all away
Leave not a heart to mend
That day I cast so far behind, I'm moving on

For all the stones thrown in my face
Hold on, move on

See me! 
Now hide your face while
You carry on 'till the grief comes
Save your soul from the downfall

Feels like living in a dream from which I cannot wake
I don't wanna hide
They are tearing me apart
You cannot pray for laughter
You cannot wake

Degenerate the love and hate
We should always ever keep in mind
Our tragedy's not far behind
Kneeling in disaster

Through all the doubt I can't allay
Hold on, move on
Now
As it was meant to be
Suffering's a travesty

Obliterate our past mistakes
We should never lose sight or well find
A travesty renewed in time
Chasing ever faster

Feels like living in a dream from which I cannot wake
I don't wanna hide
They are tearing me apart
You cannot pray for laughter
I cannot decide
I cannot wake
I cannot pray

Feels like living in a dream
From which I cannot wake
Voices leading me astray
Cannot pray
