Song:

Oh baby,
Oh baby
I’m missing you baby, oh

Sleigh bells are ringing somewhere in the distance
And I wonder just where you are
This fire side used to burn and glisten yeah
But it feels so cold when you’re far, yes it does girl

I’m standing under the mistletoe
Remembering how you kissed me, oh baby
The gifts are under the tree but I know, I know
There’s nothing there that I need
Uh nothing baby

I’m making a wish on stars above
So I can be with the one I love
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you
Snowflakes of hope are falling down,
And my heart beats but there’s no sound
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you

I pray the angels watch over you, yeah, yes baby
Until you’re back in my arms, uh, come on home
Say, I don’t need no miracles, no, no
I just need you baby
And to be wherever you are, oh yeah

We got forever to celebrate,
And fill our live with good cheer, yes we do baby
I talked with Santa Clause cause I just can’t wait
I’d do anything, I’d go anywhere,
To have you near, yeah,

I’m making a wish on stars above
So I can be with the one I love
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you
No it don’t feel like Christmas
Snowflakes of hope are falling down,
And my heart beats but there’s no sound
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you
It don’t, it don’t, it don’t

I’m reaching out across this winter wonderland
Knowing you’re reaching for me, yeah, yeah

Those Christmas lights will shine twice as brightly
Even though we’re not together tonight, it’s alright!

I’m making a wish on stars above
So I can be with the one I love
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you
No it don’t feel like Christmas
Snowflakes of hope are falling down,
And my heart beats but there’s no sound
Cause it don’t feel like Christmas time without you
It don’t, it don’t, it don’t
