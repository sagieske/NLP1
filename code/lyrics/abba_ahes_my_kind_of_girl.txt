Song:

Look at her face, it's a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

And when we go for a walk in the park
And she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?
