Song:

I'm leaving, screaming
My heart is bleeding now.
Why would you take this life away from me?

Don't you let go?
It makes you sad, I know.
We could've lived inside my 80's dream.

Before I go you should know that I'll always be here.
How could they keep me away from you?
Everytime I see my reflection in your eyes,
I know that one day you will be mine.

Imagine if we could disappear for a while,
Nothing would come between us when were away.

A scary rerun deep inside my head.
What could've happened to us if we had stayed?

Before I go you should know that I'll always be here.
How could they keep me away from you?
Everytime I see my reflection in your eyes,
I know that one day you will be mine.

[Instrumental]

Would we ever be the same if we let it fall apart?
Would we ever be the same if we let it fall apart?

Before I go you should know that I'll always be here.
How could they keep me away from you?
Everytime I see my reflection in your eyes,
I know that one day you will be mine.
