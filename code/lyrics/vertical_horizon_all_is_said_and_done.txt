Song:

I need you to hear me
I want you to feel this
It should be clear as fear
And plain as day

I'm not going to bend now
You're not going to break me
You'll never be hard enough to scratch my face

I wanted to fill you
I tried to belong here
With all of the ghosts and faded headlines
But I couldn't read you
No you wouldn't let me
You always pull away
From the ones you can't define

[Chorus:]
Are you tired
Of holding up the sky
Teaching birds to fly
You've done it all your life

Oh baby are you sad
When you see the sun
'Cause then you're not the brightest one
When all is said and done
And honey all is said and done

I need to move through this
The waiting just kills me
Whatever you do is on you
I'm washed clean
No don't be alarmed now
The story's ending
These aren't open arms
They're just waving you away

[Chorus:]

I need you to hear me
I want you to feel this
It should be clear as fear
And plain as day

[Chorus:]

Are you tired
Of running for your life
When there's no one left behind
Just the chaos in your mind

Oh baby are you sad
Each day you greet the sun
You know you're not the brightest one
When all is said and done
