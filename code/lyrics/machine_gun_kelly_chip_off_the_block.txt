[Intro:]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
I don't think ya'll know what's goin on right now
We got mgk in the booth
He bout to go in
Mgk...
Light this b***h up lets go

[Verse:]
Whoever
Woulda thought
That the little mother f****are from the land
Woulda' came up and made them stacks
Never was warm in the city
So I had to get on the record and come blaze these tracks
And I'm all around haters everyday
But I guess that's just what fame attracts
But f**k that where the bucks at
Man I need my green in a box
Like apple jacks
Matter fact
See me in a ride so foreign you can't understand
Six feet hittin six G's
Here with the 3 so come catch me if you can
Speakin ebonics
Give a f**k what Mr. Webster said
Let a smart girl read my d**k-tionary
I call that Ms. Webster head
Man I gotta get it
When I'm gonna get it
How I gotta get it
And whenever I do I get that
Every moment I want it
Cuz every day I be grindin
So when you wanna make a move
I get that
Chip off the block
My story in the booth takin off the lock
And put the s**t back on when I'm on the top
So I got the game cuffed up like the cops
But I don't f**k with them
But the eastside yeah I got love for them
Anybody wanna hate on me
Then get on my level
But you will never ever so I got scrubs for them
Yeah and I'm from the city where all the good die young
And the old don't make it
So we just hang in
In the middle ground
Ready for whatever boy don't mistake it
B***h I'm from Cleveland
Bet they know what we claim
Cuz we rylin mother fuckers est is the game
B***h

(Dj)
Mgk you killin em right now
You Killin em
Est is the movement
Get with it or get lost
Mgk you ready to go in?
Lets load up another one of them clips boy
Lets go lets go lets go

[Verse 2:]
Whoever woulda guessed that the little white boy
From the midwest woulda done fuckin numbers
Everybody used to talk down
Now the whole world wanna be-f*****g-come us
We the new team est
Line full of hos out for the vip
Everybody know I'm number 23
When I'm in the court ballin mvp biatch
Let me take a little sip of the vitamin water
And a little bit of the kushie and I'm good
Chillin up in the clouds
Wanna f**k my day up man I wish you would
B***h I'm the man
No longer the kid
Must be the reason why all these grown folks on my d**k
Get off my ballsack
Yall makin my drawers sag
Call sax
Walk up in that b***h like gimme all dat
I never had nothin
So what else do you think a little kid with a dream gon' do
Ball without a budget like f**k it the middle finger crew
Real people love me
The jealous try and degrade my name
Yall must have lost your fuckin melons
Boy I am the game

(Dj)
Are you serious
S**t
You think mgk don't run this s**t?
Mgk twist it up for 'em
Leggo

[Verse 3:]
They shoulda never let me into the building with a stereo
A pen and pad I do damage
Can't nobody ever do it like I do it
Since I been young I been goin hard I'm the baddest
Everybody from... My past
Call me my city savior
But the people in the class wanna put me in the hall
Cuz of my bad behavior
