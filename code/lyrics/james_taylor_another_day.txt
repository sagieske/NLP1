Jt on sony.com: the song's been waiting for a verse since 1985 when I first put it down at air studios, montserrat. frank was at the console then too.
Wake up suzy
Put your shoes on
Walk with me into this light
Finally this morning
I'm feeling whole again
It was a hell of a night

Just to be with you by my side
Just to have you near in my sight
Just to walk a while in this light
Just to know that life goes on

Wake up suzy
Put your shoes on
Walk with me into this light

Another night has gone
Life goes on
Another dawn is breaking
Turn and face the sun
One by one
The world outside is waking

Morning light has driven away
All the shadows that hide your way
And night has given away
To the promise of another day

Another day
Another chance that we may
Finally find our way
Another day

The sun has begun
To melt all our fears away
Another day
Another day

Oh wake up suzy
Put your shoes on
Walk with me into this light
