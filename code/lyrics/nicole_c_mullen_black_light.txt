Song:

By Nicole C. Mullen

Hopped in my car
Went down to Birmingham, Alabama
(There I) went to the museum of civil rights
And got a lesson in suffering
(There I) saw the likes of Rosa Parks,
Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King
And I got all emotional singin' "We shall over come",
"Let freedom ring"

I'm looking for a boy, looking for a girl
Who's got a dream inside to change the world.
Give me a lady
Come on give me a man
Who's strong enough to take a stand (and be a)

[Chorus:]
Black light, a candle in the darkness
(we need some more) Black light, courageous and strong
'Til there is no more bigotry and madness
All it takes is a spark, and the fire will burn on and on

I stood on my front porch with all the lights out
Guess what I was seeing
There was a myriad of diamonds flung out across a velvet sky
And it served to remind me of the perseverance of those before me
'Cause the darker the night the brighter the starlights are gonna shine
(Heee)

I'm looking for a boy looking for a girl
Who's got a dream inside to change the world
Give me a lady
Come on give me a man
Who's strong enough to take a stand (and be a)

[Chorus:]

I said the fire will burn on and on
You know the fire will burn on and on
I need more!

Black light (repeat 16 times)
