Song:

I know you've been hurt, 
I know that he broke your heart, 
I know it takes worth, 
To fix what he tore apart, 

Girl you know I got you, 
It's your world I won't stop you, 
And whenever you're ready, 
I'll be the one who's gone love you, 

You heard it all before, 
Girl now let me show it, 
Hit it and quit oh no, 
I need someone to grow with, 

I won't play no games, 
Girl come join my campaign, 

I said ooh–oooooh, 
I can do it better for you, 
I tell her ooh–oooooh, 
I can do it better, I can do it better, 

Baby I won't do you like that, 
Break you're heart, 
Make you cry, 
Na na na, 
I won't do you like that, 
Do you like that, 
I won't do you like that, 

She got me like, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
My way, 

Pick you up, take you out, 
Turn you on, turn you off, 
Love you like you're supposed to, 
Take my time get to know you, 

Ooh you body, 
Nobody, got a body like yo body, 
And I beg your pardon, 
But that thing retarded, 

Oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh, 
I know you heard it all before, 
Na na na, 

But I won't play no games, 
Girl come join my campaign, 

I said ooh–oooooh, 
I can do it better for you, 
I tell her ooh–oooooh, 
I can do it better, I can do it better, 

Baby I won't do you like that, 
Break you're heart, 
Make you cry, 
Na na na, 
I won't do you like that, 
Do you like that, 
I won't do you like that, 

She got me like, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
Shawty swing my way, 
My way
