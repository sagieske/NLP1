Song:

Well it's 2 am, I've got a heartache to go
I've been waiting too long for my baby to show
I've got 2. 5 off a bottle or two
And damn if I know what a man's got to do
So look if you want me tonight
I'll be at the dreamers lounge
Face down in the gutter
Where my heart is numb
Face down in the gutter
Where the pain is gone
I can't get up and the concrete is cold
But the lead in my veins is turning to gold
I've got jd eyes so I don't need to see
To know I have landed where I wanted to be
So look if you want me tonight
I'll be at the dreamers lounge
Face down in the gutter
Where my heart is numb
Face down in the gutter
Where the pain is gone
So long
