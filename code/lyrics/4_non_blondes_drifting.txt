Song:

What a wonderful hesitation
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
Who would bear to feel sorry for me
Dropped another pill just to calm me
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
Find myself awake counting sad days
1-2-3 that's too many for me
Reached for my hand but it was already there
Dropped another pill just to find me
Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop
That lost it's way when I decided to roam
Chasing me was a hungry dweller
Come follow me you won't expect the illusion
But I had escaped it by pretending to die
You'll see it's my imagination
Hand me your eyes
I will put them in front of mine
You'll see a little better
You'll see a little better
Where I am now
What a wonderful destination
I can no longer see
Dropped another pill just to kill me
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep
There I was drifting
Way out into the sunshine
Look at me I'm a tangled puppet
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive
But I had escaped it by pretending to die
