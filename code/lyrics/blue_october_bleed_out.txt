Song:

Close my eyes
Feel you sigh
A desperate aching wonder
Will you ever, ever let me off my knees

Wide awake
Like a dream
As simple as a secret
Being told, told to everyone but me

Will I
Bleed out
I gave it all
But you can't stop taking from me
And way down I know
You know where to cut me
With your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long
Til this heart stops beating
So don't let me
Bleed out here alone
Hear my plea
You won't hear my plea

Sudden rain
Coming down
It all comes back to me
Waking up, falling down

Another day
Come undone
I keep trying to heal your pain
In return, you cut me over and over
One more time and I will

Bleed out
I gave it all
But you can't stop taking from me
And way down I know
You know where to cut me
With your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long
Til my heart stops beating
So don't let me
Bleed alone

I finally feel like I'm supposed to be, yeah, oh
Don't you take this moment away from me
But before you kill me wont you
Wont you look back in my eyes and watch me

Bleed out
I gave it all
But you can't stop taking from me
And way down I know
You know where to cut me
With your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long
Til my heart stops beating
So don't leave me don't let me
Bleed out here alone
Hear my plea

Bleed out
I gave it all
But you can't stop taking from me
And way down I know
You know where to cut me
With your eyes closed
Bleed out
It won't be long
Til this heart stops beating
So don't leave me don't let me
Bleed out here alone
