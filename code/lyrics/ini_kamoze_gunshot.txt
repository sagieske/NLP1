Song:

Hey, run for cover
Gunshot respect not, booma
Gunshot in the respect notch
Shot, respect not, gunshot in the respect notch

Now cats and dogs and men and people
For some it's good and some, stupid evil
For Kings and Queens and El Presidente
Or passer-by and spy or could wind up in the cemetery

Shot, respect not, booma
Gunshot in the respect notch
Shot, respect not
Gunshot in the respect notch
Hey dunno what a bullet won't do, hey

Even the minister and the sinister
A marine of Brigadista
Some win, some lose
And some skip across the border

When men were bold
This thing wasn't plenty
Now that heaven and earth are old
Hey, one fool makes many

Gunshot respect not, skeng-eh
Gunshot in the respect notch
Shot, respect not, skeng-eh
Gun shot in the respect notch

Ow, oh, oh
Run for cover
I dunno what a bullet won't do

Follow you round the corner
Follow you across the border
When it hits, it hurts
Throw ya down in the dirt

They have to cover ya with earth
Hey, hey, hey
Tear drops like rainbow

Even the minister and the sinister
A marine of Brigadista
Some win, some lose
And some skip across the border

When men were bold
This killin' wasn't plenty
Now that heaven and earth are old
Hey, one fool makes many

Gunshot respect not, skeng-eh
Gunshot in the respect notch
Shot, respect not
Gunshot in the respect notch

Ow, ow, ow
Run for cover
I dunno what a bullet won't do
Hey, I dunno what a bullet won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Follow you 'round the corner
Follow you across the border
Tracks you down to ya mother
Running you down into the streets and lanes

Hits the juice out of ya veins, hey, hey
I dunno what a bullet won't do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I dunno what a bullet won't do, hey

Gunshot respect not, skeng-eh
Gunshot in the respect notch
Shot, respect not
Gun shot in the respect notch, ow, ow, ow
