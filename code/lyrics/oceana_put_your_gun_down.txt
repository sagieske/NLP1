Song:

Standin' here, face to face
Feel the fear in this place
Too much blood has been she'd
We can't forgive, we can't forget
Why do we hurt each other?
Life could be so much better
Too hearts, one love
Many faces for one god

Tonight
We don't fight
I surrender
Now put your gun down
Tonight
We don't fight
Love is stronger
So put your gun down

Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down

Silent tears raining down
Lonelyness all around
Too hearts, one love
Many faces for one god

Tonight
We don't fight
I surrender
Now put your gun down
Tonight
We don't fight
Love is stronger
So put your gun down

Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down

What, what, what, 
What are we waiting for?
Love, love, love, 
Love is the only cure

What, what, what, 
What are we waiting for?
Love, love, love, 
Love is the only cure

Tonight
We don't fight
I surrender
Now put your gun down
Tonight
We don't fight
Love is stronger
So put your gun down

Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down
Put your gun down
