Song:

God of all creation orders all the universe
Every detail of the corners of the earth now
He covers, nothing comes between His mighty hand

And nothing can surprise Him 'cause He knows all about you
Every detail of the corners of your heart now
He loves you and nothing you could do can take that from you

Let love carry you, let His heart cover you like a big, warm coat
So you can be warm whenever you're cold now
He goes before you know with a big, bright banner across this town
Saying, "Here comes my child, here comes my child"

You'll never walk alone now 'cause He loves to surround you
Your name is written on His hands and on His heart now
He loves you and nothing you can do can take that from you

Let love carry you, let His heart cover you like a big, warm coat
So you can be warm whenever you're cold now
He goes before you now with a big, bright banner across this town
Saying, "Here comes my child, here comes my child"

Keep truth in whatever you do and His favor will rest on you
Keep hold of every promise He has given
Keep giving all of your life and be a living sacrifice
'Cause He's given you everything you need in Jesus
Everything you need, oh

Let love carry you, let His heart cover you like a big, warm coat
So you can be warm whenever you're cold now
He goes before you now with a big, bright banner across this town
Saying, "Here comes my child, here comes my child"

Let love carry you, let His heart cover you like a big, warm coat
So you can be warm whenever you're cold now
He goes before you now with a big, bright banner across this town
Saying, "Here comes my child, here comes my child"
Here comes my child, here comes my child, Amen
