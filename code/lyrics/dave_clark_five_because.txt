Song:

It's right that I should care about you
And try to make you happy when you're blue
It's right, it's right to feel the way I do
Because, because I love you

It's wrong to say I don't think of you
'Cause when you say these things
You know it makes me blue
Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me, a chance to be near you
Because, because I love you

Organ solo

Give me one kiss and I'll be happy
Just, just to be with you
Give me, give me a chance to near you
Because, because I love you

Because, because I love you
