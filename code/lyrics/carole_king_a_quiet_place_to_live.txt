Song:

All I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can enjoy the fruits of my labor
Read the paper and not have to cry out loud
In my mind I can see it crystal clear
Sharing my dreams with the people around me
Now they surround me and I'm just a part of the crowd

What will become of us?
What about the children?
What will they do to us next time around?
What will the answer be?
What will it mean to me?
When are they gonna see we're underground
Here underground

And all I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can be free in a world of my making
Instead of taking what they decided to give
I wouldn't want what they have no
If I could only find a quiet place to live
