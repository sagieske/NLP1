(feat. Justin Timberlake & Timbaland)

(Hey) Flo Rida
Poe Boy
Mail on Sunday the album comin' soon
It's the movement, shorty I see you
I'm a give you this cake...
E'rr day

Hey... My team on the scene full of green full of bling
Got cream in they jeans, tippin' on g-strings
Freaks with tongue rings used to be prom queen with a strut that's me
Shorty you want it you gotta come place your order
And I might invest in two daughters like two quarters
Invest in vitamin water if I adore ya
Drop it on my lap
You can make it clap
Money in the trap of the body tap all like a scout
Run a lap around a pole I'm makin' a stove bank rolls
And the paint glossin'-a but I ain't 'Zo
Lemme know when you ready to get low
Flo Rida spendin' cheddar whatever to get dough dollars holler
Rubberband might pop Franklin's collar
Give it up like I'm bein' jacked by robbers

Ready you ready go 'head undress
All I wanna see is flesh
You the bunny I'm Hef
Playboy with money feed you like a chef
Got beads for your honey, Poe boy I rep
Triple C's Johnny boy let's take it to the Lex
Cocos, diamonds where the charms get wet
Take one bout it might get some neck
20, 000 we breakin' bread

Flo Rida's hotter then technology dirty your knees
Getcha some cheese, girl I'm a G
Help you Succeed, suck seed, babies indeed
Unforgettable special to me
I wanna give it to shorty that tease
Yea, study little mama physique
Yea, my present is -vedababree-

[Chorus:]
Baby this a new age, you like my new craze
Let's get together maybe we can start a new phase
The smokes got the club all hazy, spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here, you got me saying

Ayo, I'm tired of using technology, why don't you sit down on top of me
Ayo, I'm tired of using technology, I need you right in front of me

Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it, uh uh (soo), I got to give it to her [X2]

Your hips, your thighs, you got me hypnotized, let me tell you [X4]

Shes already fallin in love with my timbs
The best of both worlds
Timberland right I got -Timbalick leff-
Knockin' yo boots gotta step it up girl
I seduce you with loot that I throw in the air
The e-pit the apple my money was there
I love the big apple cause they love a playa
I'm tryin' a put strippers in Madison Square Garden
Like Adam would not litter garden
Tippin' I'm ready to bargain
Break bread witcha get some head witcha
Go to bed witcha get fed witcha get it wet witcha
Come over here girl I'm ready to hug
I ain't gotta cut no more records for what
Now'days how they rappin' always double up
Yet they tryin' sell platinum like diamond too much

Dammit I'm on, I wanna see you in a thong
Henne Petrone, that get the woman in the zone
Shorty your groan then we can get get gone
I'm into shrums that wanna lick lick dome
Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Christina Aguilera might swallow my children
That's three tongues brother come pull a million
Girl go'n back it up -bring shrunk- in that buildin'

Stuntin' when I wanna shorty hot like the summer
Make it drop never wonder where the gwap come fromma
Maybe out the sky if you show me a thigh
Get that -M. O. Witty Y- to afford you a Hummer
I wanna good time, just peek in my mind
That bump and that grind, your rump'd do fine
Can't front you's a dime
Okay, I'm lyin'
Like crooks doin time, my zipper is blind

[Chorus:]
