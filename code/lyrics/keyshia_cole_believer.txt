Song:

It's only right boy
To touch you like I'm touching you right now
To give you everything you need oh boy
You don't have to worry, not at all
Remember this night boy
I scream that oh my god it felt right boy
We got so loud they told us to pipe down
But once we turn it on, can't turn it off

In the morning right before I let you get up
I love you down, and make you where it's hard to get up
For my lips won't miss a spot, then work your way up
Lift me hands, feed up
Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees believer
Boy I'mma leave praying that this night don't ever end
Believer
Make a believer
Tonight the breathe is going deeper
As your knees get weaker
I'mma have to shout it out

It's only right boy
To do you like a woman's supposed to
Won't stop until you want to propose
I shouldn't say forever, let's go
It's only right boy
You want to get a kiss to me right now
Don't wait until your heart is in the creeper
We got something special lined
Nooo

In the morning right before I let you get up
I love you down, and make you where it's hard to get up
For my lips won't miss a spot, then work your way up
Lift me hands, feed up
Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees believer
Boy I'mma leave praying that this night don't ever end
Believer
Make a believer
Tonight the breathe is going deeper
As your knees get weaker
I'mma have to shout it out

I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe
Make you a believer
A true believer
On your knees believer
Boy I'mma leave praying that this night don't ever end
Believer
Make a believer
Tonight the breathe is going deeper
As your knees get weaker
I'mma have to shout it out

I believe
I believe
I believe
I believe

I'mma have to shout it out

I believe
