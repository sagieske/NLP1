Song:

She could take a leaf upon a tree and turn it into gold
Just as she could take a piece of rope which on its own will fold
You see, she's a very extraordinary sort of girl

Why don't you take a stone and eat it just as if it were a cake
You could be surprised to see the sort of things that she can bake
You see, she's a very extraordinary sort of girl

Who is just the same as you and she
In every way with quality she's perfect
But if you take her out
Remember she can break your heart in two
But she'll put it back, glue it together, make it look brand new
You see, she's a very extraordinary sort of girl

Why don't you take a stone and eat it just as if it were a cake
You could be surprised to see the sort of things that she can bake
You see, she's a very extraordinary sort of girl

Who is just the same as you and she
In every way with quality she's perfect
But if you take her out
Remember she can break your heart in two
But she'll put it back, glue it together, make it look brand new

You see, she's a very extraordinary sort of female, woman
You know the type
