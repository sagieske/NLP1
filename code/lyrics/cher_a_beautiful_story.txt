Song:

What's your name? Is it Jane?
Would you mind sitting next to a silly old fool?
It's just that I'm tired of wasting my hours
Talking to trees, watching the flowers grow
Watching birds chasing bees, little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?

Chorus:
Don't misunderstand me
I'm just an old man with no place to go
& if you oblige me, sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story, a beautiful story
That you might not know
Please don't go

Pardon me, Mr. Tree
I hope that I didn't offend you before
You are my friend, but I wanted much more
Now I'm back once again just like always before
Watching birds chasing bees, little boys scraping knees
Even my tears have all dried
Can I sit by your side?

[Chorus:]
