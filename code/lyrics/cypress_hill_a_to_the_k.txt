A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (to the what?)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K

One, life had begun for the ruffneck
Kid who was gonna put ni***z in check
Eighteen, G, for the green
Obscene, and it's for the time being
I'm pickin nine, hell I'm out to get mine
And pick two homies, three com-bine
Next thing you know, jump in the six-fo'
Get out, c*** the hammer, then kick down the do'

A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (motherfuckin K?!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K

[Sen Dog]
Couple ni***z from the Eastside, headed Eastbound
Lookin for a pound, to haul around town
Here comes a clown, I gotta hold my ground
Hear the slug comin, when it come you fall down
Buckdown, dead sound, that's what you found
That's what you get when you f**k the brown
Dog, Sen is comin, to the mound
La Vida from Cypress, rips your compound
S**t gets deep, eight ni***z on the ground
What do you know? What - go ah-round come around!
Six for the pig, and his punk hound
Hail to the king pig, or you get crowned
Or better yet, I'll roll you up like a fat J

[B-Real]
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (motherfuckin K?!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K

It's gonna be on.. It's gonna be on..
(It's gonna be on.. Goin on!)
It's gonna be on.. It's gonna be on..
(It's gonna be on.. Goin on!)
It's gonna be on.. It's gonna be on..
(It's gonna be on.. Goin on!)

[B-Real]
Gimme that weed fool and all your loot too
I got a n***a in the back and the blunt for your crew
Loaded and cocked for any hardrock
If you're takin my weed, I'm takin over your spot
Keep your face down as I take your pound
Don't let me see nobody get up, just hug the ground
(Stay still) And don't make a sound
As I get out the door, headed Eastbound
But, why did the fool try to act brave? (act brave)
Clip from the nine equals six to the grave

A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (motherfuckin K?!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K (A to the K!)
A to the motherfuckin K homeboy
A to the motherfuckin K
