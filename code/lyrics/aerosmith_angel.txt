Song:

I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light

Baby, You're my Angel, come and save me tonight
You're my Angel, come and make it alright

Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feelin' inside
Yes, it's true, loneliness took me for a ride
Without your love, I'm nothing but a beggar

Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone

Baby, You're my Angel, come and save me tonight
You're my Angel, come and make it alright
Come and save me tonight

(Guitar Solo)

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

Baby, baby, baby

You're my Angel, come and save me tonight
You're my Angel, come and make it alright

You're my Angel, come and save me tonight
You're my Angel, come and take me alright
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
