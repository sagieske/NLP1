She touched my heart and said ebezina nozugo, oh oh

Eh, was so glad, the way she keeps me smiling

It brings me joy she proves this loving is real

Within my heart there's nobody else

You're my heart and my sweetness

Is this love? Is this love? I don’ t know

But I know what I'm feeling

Na God be my witness

The way she keeps me smiling it brings me joy

She proves this loving is real

Within my heart there’ s nobody else

Baby give me your hand, give me your hand

Konvict Music (Maybach Music)

We fell in love on the first day, the first day
A beautiful girl gon make the Earth shake
I look into the mirror all I do is stare
In the back of my mind all I see is her (boss)
Turn up the music we bumping P Square
Number one in the game and we gon be here
Huh! Always making hit in, am I a Konvict? Huh!
We talking money here you talking nonsense
Making slow love to my baby girl
Got the big trucks pulling up everywhere
You only live once and that's the anthem
All your negative energy feed cancer
I can look into her eyes for my whole life
We can make love for the whole night
Huh! Take my hand baby, (Rozay)
I just wanna be your man baby
