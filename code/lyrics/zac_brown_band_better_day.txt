Song:

The day started out like any other
He woke up and his feet rolled off like lead
It's a blessing and a curse to remember
All the things that she once said
I love you
The sun came up slow today
He's got to learn to live that way
It's cold in his bed, it's cold in his bed.
He'll find some strength to linger on
Past the footsteps of the dawn
She's running through his head, she's running through
His head.
And it matters, and it matters to him.
And it matters, she's underneath his skin.
She lives up underneath his skin.
He's gotta find a better day
Five years now and still he knew
The way she smiled when she said the news
That their two would now be three
A brand new baby
Made his vows to last a life long
Brought it to him wrapped it up
Yeah he wrapped it in a song
He wrapped his whole life in that song
And it matters, and it matters to him.
And it matters, she's underneath his skin.
She lives up underneath his skin.
He's gotta find a better day
He stays away from windy heights
He's afraid that he might fly
On his knees he asks God why
On those slow nights he can still hear the flat line
He can still hear the flat line
And it matters, and it matters to him.
And it matters, she's underneath his skin.
She lives up underneath his skin.
He's gotta find a better day
