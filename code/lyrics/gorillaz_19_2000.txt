Song:

The world is spinnin' too fast.
I'm buyin' lead Nike shoes,
To keep myself tethered
To the days I tried to lose.
Oh yeah
My mama said "To slow down,"
You must make your own shoes
"Stop dancin' to the music"
"of Gorillaz in a happy mood"
Oh yeah
Keep a mild groove on...

You get the cooooool! (lalalalala)
Get the cool shoe shine! (lalalalala)
You Get the coool! (lalalalala)
Get the cool shoe shiine! (lalalalala)
You Get the cooooooool! (lalalalala)
Get the cool shoe shine! (lalalalala)
You Get the coooool! (lalalalala)
Get the cool shoe shiiiiine!

There's a monkey in the jungle,
Watchin' a vapor trail.
Caught up in the conflict
Between his Brain and his Tail.
Oh yeah
And if time's elimination,
Then we got nothin' to lose.
Please repeat the message.
It's the music that we choose.
Oh yeah
Keep a mild groove on...
