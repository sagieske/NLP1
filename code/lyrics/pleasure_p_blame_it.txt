Song:

I told you I wouldn't cheat
I told you I wouldn't lie
I told you I was different
I wasn't like the most of guys

I told you I was ready
Since now my games are settled down
I told you I was gonna change what I'm happened out

What a one man loses
Can be another man's treasure
I better wake up wake up wake up wake up
Before we break up break up break up break up
There's no excuses
Girl I gotta do better
I better wake up
Before we break up

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

I not trying to say that I wanna give up
But momma used to say that you can't force love
If love has spinned us so far
It might have gone
Let it go go go go

What a one man loses
Can be another man's treasure
I better wake up wake up wake up wake up
Before we break up break up break up break up
There's no excuses
Girl I gotta do better
I better wake up
Before we break up

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

I not trying to say that I wanna give up
But momma used to say that you can't force love
If love has spinned us so far
It might have gone

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

I not trying to say that I wanna give up
But momma used to say that you can't force love
If love has spinned us so far
It might have gone

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

Don't blame it on you
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on love

I not trying to say that I wanna give up
But momma used to say that you can't force love
If love has spinned us so far
It might have gone
Let it go go go go
