Song:

Ran across a friend of mine
Hadn't seen since eleventh grade
Saw our name on the marquie sign
And stopped in to see us play

He said, man it's been a few years
I said, man, they'll let anybody in here
We sat and talked of rebel days gone by
And we laughed of how our dreams of California
Never got much past the county line
We drank a toast to long lost friends
And all those crazy things we did

It was freebird in a firebird
On the way up Hawthorne road
Long necks, long hair
Wild eyed girls and rock and roll
Play the drum set on the dance floor
Lighters held up for the encore
And not a worry in that southern summer sky
And we let that freebird fly

He said, man it's funny
How that time is bound to race
And how you'd give back your right arm
To get back just a day

Or retaste your first teenage kiss
Feel them backroads turn and twist
Seeing nothing but dust in your rearview

There wasn't a car in our town any faster
Now yesterday's just rusting in my pasture
We were too big, the town was too small
But looking back we had it all

Singing freebird in a firebird
On the way up Hawthorne road
Long necks, long hair
Wild eyed girls and rock and roll
Play the drum set on the dance floor
Lighters held up for the encore
And not a worry in that southern summer sky
And we let that freebird fly

[Instrumental Interlude]

It was freebird in a firebird
On the way up Hawthorne road
Long necks, long hair
Wild eyed girls and rock and roll
Play the drum set on the dance floor
Lighters held up for the encore
And not a worry in that southern summer sky
And we let that freebird fly
Let that freebird fly
Fly on freebird
