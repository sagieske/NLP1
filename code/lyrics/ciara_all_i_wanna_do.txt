All I wanna do is

Rock ya body all night and day

I wanna let you know I'm really feelin you
And you know what I wanna do with you

So I can dance up all over you
Show you what I can really do

Verse 2: ciara
I said I wanna rock ya body
Night and day
Then I'm gonna take you home
And I'm gonna say
Tell me if you wanna play
I know it makes me seem easy
But I'm just doin it to hear you say
That you really enjoyed me today
And you wanna tell me
That we can be
Just more than friends today

Chorus: x2
All I wanna do is
Get next to you
Take ya home so we can play
Rock your body all night and day
