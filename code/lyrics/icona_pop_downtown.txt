Song:

We walk the streets of the suburbs
You hold my hand like it's all I need
We kiss in the woods behind your parents' place
I whisper, I'll tell you 'bout my dreams

Can we keep it simple? Just give me what I need.
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...

I need to feel you love me
[?], baby
You should know by now, I like it
I like it when you kiss me downtown

We walk the streets in a circle
We know every corner by heart
Subway south and I'm outta here
Are you in? Are you out?

Loving me is simple, just give me what I need
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...

I need to feel you love me
Baby
You should know by now, I like it
I like it when you kiss me downtown

Can we keep it simple? Just give me what I need.
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...

Downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...
I like it better when we go to downtown, downtown
I like it when you kiss me downtown, town, town...
