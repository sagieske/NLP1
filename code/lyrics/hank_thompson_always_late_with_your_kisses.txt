ALWAYS LATE (WITH YOUR KISSES)
(Lefty Frizzell - Blackie Crafford)
" Â© '50 Hill & Range Songs "
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darling and stay
Always late with your kisses why oh why do you want to do me this way
How long do you think I can wait when you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses why oh why do you want to do me this way
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darling and stay
Always late with your kisses why oh why do you want to do me this way
