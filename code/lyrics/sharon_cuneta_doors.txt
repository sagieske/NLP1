Song:

Doors, why do there have to be doors?
'Cause when you walked right out of
Yours and mine
It made me wonder why there are tears
Where is the end of all of these tears?
Where's the face that used to cheer me up?
Boy, it makes me wonder...
Why does my heart just keep on beating?
Why do my arms just keep on reaching
Someone who's no longer there?
What can I say besides I'm sorry?
What can I say to change your mind?
What can I do to make tomorrow yours and mine?
Chairs, why do there have to be chairs?
'Cause yours is empty now,
There's no one there
It really makes me wonder...
