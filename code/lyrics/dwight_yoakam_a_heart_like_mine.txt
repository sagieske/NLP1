Song:

I saw you comin'
You saw me and took off runnin'
Those shadows in your eyes
Were such a sweet disguise

Chorus:
Oh I, I wonder why
You never tried
To understand
A heart like mine

I just wasted time
Till I lost all I could find
So any that you see
Surely must belong to me

Chorus: (x2)
I wonder why
You never tried
To understand
A heart like mine
