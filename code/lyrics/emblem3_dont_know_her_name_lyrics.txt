Song:

Ended up in my place, she never told me her name

When I woke up, I was alone

I don't understand what made her run away cuz

I felt like JJ, we share the same soul

I wish I would have asked what she's about

But she snuck out the back when the sun came out


oooooooo

I really wish that she had stayed

Could have never left the bed all day

But I don't even know her name

Don't even know her, I-I don't even know her name

Don't know her name


Running down my street asking everybody

And they all tell me I'm out of my mind

Staring at the ceiling, I can't shake this feeling

She forgot me and she's doing all right

I wish I would have asked what she's about

But she snuck out the back when the sun came out


oooooooo

I really wish that she would had stayed

Could have never left the bed all day

But I don't even know her name

Don't even know her, I-I don't even know her name

I wish I told her what she meant to me

could have had more than a memory

But I don't even know her name

Don't even know her, I-I don't even know her name


You know you got me, I'm falling

Don't even know who you are

I got to find you, I really need to

You hold a piece of my heart

I wish I would have asked what she's about

But she snuck out the back when the sun came out


oooooooo

I really wish that she had stayed

Could have never left the bed all day (never left the bed)

But I don't even know her name

Don't even know her, I-I don't even know her name (I don't even know her name)

Wish I told her what she meant to me 

Couldv'e had more than a memory (So much more baby)

But I don't even know her name

Don't even know her, I-I don't even know her name


I don't know her name (Don't know her name)

I don't her name (Don't her name)

I don't know her name (x3)

I don't even know her name
