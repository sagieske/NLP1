Song:

Anxiety, don’t pressure us 

Faster, I dream in speeds of ashes
My heart it beats and crashes
I’m running from the truth
Cause it fucks with my mind

Waiting, we’re silly, we’re so reckless
The city it’s so heartless
A bottle full of crude
That washed up in the tide

Don’t pressure us, anxiety
I’m a passenger 
So serious, anxiety
Just a passenger

Handsome and callous, young believers
Hiding, plotting schemers
And rotting out like fruit
That was left here to die

Talking, waited after hours
Time is bending outward
I’m falling to my knees
To crawl home safe inside

Don’t pressure us, anxiety
I’m a passenger
So dangerous, anxiety
Just a passenger
