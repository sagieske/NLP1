Song:

The heart ache is over
I pushed you aside
There's no more illusion
As you've realised
Its no hesitation
I'm running alone
The last chain is broken
Now I'm on my own

I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love
I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with your big bad love I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love
I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love

Your cruel game is over
Your frighten to heart
There's no more confusion
Your life and you start
It's no hesitation
I'm running alone
The last Chain is broken
Now I'm on my own

I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love
I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love
I'm so tired of your big bad love
I'm so fed up with you big bad love
I'm so tired of your big bad love
