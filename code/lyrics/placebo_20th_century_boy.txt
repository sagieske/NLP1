Song:

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like robin hood
I move like a rat, talk like a cat, sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your toy your twentieth century boy

Friends says it's fine, friends says it's good
Everybody says it's just like robin hood

Fly like a plane, drive like a car, hold out your hand
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your boy your twentieth century toy

Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy

Friends say it's fine, friends say it's good
Everybody says it's just like rock and roll
I move like a cat, talk like a rat, sting like a bee
Babe I'm gonna be your man
And it's plain to see you were meant for me, yeah
I'm your toy your twentieth century boy

Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
Twentieth century boy
I wanna be your toy
