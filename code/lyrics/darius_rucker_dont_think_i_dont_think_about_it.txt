Song:

I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust
Swore I wasn't comin back
Said I'd had eonugh
Saw you in the rear view standin'
Fadin from my life
But I wasn't turnin' round
No not this time

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder bout
Could've been should've been all worked out

I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

When we make choices
We gotta live with it
Heard you found a real good man and you married him

I wonder if sometime I cross your mind?
Where would we be today of if I never drove that car away?

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder bout
Could've been should've been all worked out

Yeah I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think you don't get to me
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey
Don't think I don't wonder bout
Could've been should've been all worked out

I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

No no

Don't think I don't
Don't think I don't
