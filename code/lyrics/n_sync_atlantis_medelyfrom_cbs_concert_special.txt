Song:

Stand By Me

(Tim Mcgraw)
When the night has come,
and the land is dark.
And the moon,
is the only light we'll see.

(Tim Mcgraw and jc)
No, I won't, be afraid
Oh I won't
Be afraid
Just as long as you
stand, stand by me.

(All)
So darlin', darlin'
stand... By me
Ohhhh stand by me (x2)
Stand by me,
Stand by me.

(Joey)
If the sky
That we look upon,
Should tumble and fall.
Or the mountain,
Should crumble to the sea.

(Chris)
I won't cry, I won't cry.
No I won't shed a tear.
Just as long
As you stand
Stand by me.

(All)
So darlin', darlin'
Stand, by me.
Ohhhh stand by me.
Woahh stand now,
Stand by me.
Stand by me.
Stand by me.

Fire and Rain

(Tim Mcgraw)
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

(All)
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

(Justin)
Won't you look down upon me Jesus
You got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way.. Oh yea

(All)
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby just one more time

Lean On Me

(Lance)
Sometimes in our lives
we all have pain
we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there's always tomorrow

(All)
Lean on me
when you're not strong
and i'll be your friend
i'll help you carry on
for it won't be long
till I'm gonna need
somebody to lean on

(Tim Mcgraw)
just call on me brother
if you need a hand
we all need somebody to leeeaaannn on
I just might have a problem that youll understand
we all need somebody to lean on

(crowd sings it)
we all need somebody to lean on (2x's)

(All)
lean on me (yeah yeah)
when youre not strong
and ill be your friend
ill help you carry on
for it wont be long
till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

(Tim Mcgraw)
No it wont be long till I'm gonna need somebody to lean on.
