Song:

Wow!
Before your life is over, know this to be true
All the hate we hold inside still won't save your youth
Don't waste your time on tragedy, easy to forget
Time that's lost and enemies fought are worth the price to live

One day at a time, one day at a time
Listen when we're calling
Your time has arrived

Our days are numbered in the world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life, nobody can seem to get it right
Whoa
Our days are numbered and you're no fool, nobody's fool

Man worships the gospel that they preach to you
Living like a demon, a burden left to prove
You can live your life in heaven or create your hell
We will write our end result with every tale we tell

One day at a time, one day at a time
Listen when we're calling
Your time has arrived

Ha-ha!

Our days are numbered in a world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life, nobody can seem to get it right
Whoa
Our days are numbered and you're no fool, nobody's fool

Ha-ha-ha!

These steps we take to be fearless are yours, life is yours
When deaths at stake you'll be fearless, be sure, life is yours

Our days are numbered in the world of fools
We feel the hunger and follow no ones rules
Everybody wants eternal life, nobody can seem to get it right
Whoa
Our days are numbered and you're no fool, nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
I'm nobody's fool
