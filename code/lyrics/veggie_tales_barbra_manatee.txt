Narrotor: and now it's time for silly songs with larry
The part of the show where larry comes out and sings A silly song
We join larry as he follows the tragic saga of barbra manatee
In the day time drama endangered love

Larry: Barbra Manatee (Manatee, Manatee)
You are the one for me (one for me, one for me)
Sent from up above (up above, up above)
You are the one I love (I love, I love, I love)

Bill: "please don't cry Bar-ba-ra,
You're a nice Manatee,
You've been so good to me
But I must go into the world and do noble things for the good of all
And you can't come because you don't speak Frrrench
Au revoir"

Barbra: "but if you leave Bill
Who will take me to the ball?
Who's gonna take me to the ball, Bill?
I have a new dress and shoes
And new manatee lipstick
Who will take me to the ball? "

Larry: "I'll take you to the ball Barbra Manatee!"

Barbra: "please don't go"

Bill: "I must"

Barbra: "don't go!"

Bill: "I must!"

Barbra: "don't!"

Bill: "must!"

Barbra: "don't don't!"

Bill: "must must!"

Larry: Barbra Manatee (Manatee, Manatee)
You are the one for me (one for me, one for me)
Sent from up above (a manatee from heaven)
You are the one I love
Barbra Manatee (Manatee, Manatee)
I'll be your mon amie (mon amie, mon amie)
I'll take you to the ball(to the ball, to the ball)
I hope your not to tall (they might have trouble dancing)

Barbra: "Bill, I've learned French"

Bill: "you have?"

Barbra: "mais, oui. je suis Manatee. See?"

Bill: "oui, oui mon amie
I always knew you could
I really hoped you would
Now can we go into the world and do noble things for the good of all? "

Barbra: "yes, but first, will you take me to the ball?
Oh, Bill, will you take me to the ball? "

Bill: "... I can't dance"

Barbra: "you cant! ?"

Bill: "no"

Barbra: "I must go"

Bill: "please don't go"

Barbra: "I must"

Bill: "don't go!"

Barbra: "I must!"

Bill: "don't!"

Barbra: "must!"

Bill: "don't don't!"

Barbra: "must must!"
