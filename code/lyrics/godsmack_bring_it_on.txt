Song:

If this thing should come around
I'm gonna take it down
No more treading through my space
I need to separate

It's inside
It's looking to break free
And constantly taking everything
As I bring it all way
Now bring it on to me
Bring it on!

Face down
Broken all around
But I'll still be standing here
All you make yourself out to be,
Doesn't equal half of me

It's inside
It's looking to break free
And constantly taking everything
As I bring it all way
Now bring it on to me

No!
Bring it on Son
All the way; All the way
Bring it!
All the way. All the way, All the way
Bring it!
All the way. All the way, All the way
Bring it!
All the way. All the way, All the way
Bring it!
All the way

It's inside
It's looking to break free
And constantly taking everything
As I bring it all way, All Day
Now bring it on to me
Bring it on! Yeah!
