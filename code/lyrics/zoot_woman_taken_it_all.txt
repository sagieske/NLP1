Song:

I just can't get with you
I just can't get with you

Can't you see
You've taken the soul from me
I can see
I've been lost on the way

I just can't get with you
There's nothing left
Just a view we cannot share

Always thought there'd be

A way for me and you

Can't you see
You're something less to me
Never free
I'll watch you move away

Can't you see
You've taken the soul from me
Should have seen
You'd take it out of me
You've taken it all from me
