Song:

How could I but love You
My Savior and my God
How could I but serve You
When on the cross
You were the servant of all
How could I but follow You
When all Your ways
Lead to freedom and life
How could I but love You
My Savior and My God

How could I but love You
How could I but serve You
How could I but follow You

My God

How could I but love You
My Comforter my strength
How could I but serve You
When in this life
You've been so faithful and true
How could I but follow You
When someday soon
You'll open Heaven for me
How could I but love You
My Savior and my God
