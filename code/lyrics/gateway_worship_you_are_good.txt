Song:

Your kindness leads me to repentance
Your goodness draws me to Your side
Your mercy calls me to be like You
Your favor is my delight
Every day, I'll awaken my praise
And pour out a song from my heart

You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever
You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever
You are good, and Your mercy is forever

Your kindness leads me to repentance
Your goodness draws me to Your side
Your mercy calls me to be like You
Your favor is my delight
Every day, I'll awaken my praise
And pour out a song from my heart

You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever
You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever

You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever
You are good, You are good
You are good, and Your mercy is forever

Your kindness is forever, Your goodness is forever
Your mercy is forever, forever
Your kindness is forever, Your goodness is forever
Your mercy is forever, forever
