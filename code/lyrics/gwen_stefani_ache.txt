Song:

Ache woke up this morning and felt no too cool
'cause every time I tried to make my mouth move
The pain I'm having is so discomforting
Please make this suffering go away

I told my mom what I was feeling
And how long I've been dealing with it
Knew it was coming, but didn't know how soon
She said I've reached another adolescent monsoon

Oooo ahh... the pain is tremendous
Why can't I take it like a man
Oooo ahh... the pain is horrendous
Why don't you lend a helpin' hand

He was a well-educated man, had his degree in medicine
I noticed his hairy hands... he was a very, very hairy man
He looked right down in, shook his head and then
Said "these teeth must be pulled right away!"

He turned around, rolled up his sleeve
I rolled my eyes then suddenly
A horrible pain grew, the next thing that I knew
The doc had pulled my wisdom teeth...out!
Well along with my teeth my money also left me
As he made out the bill, I was moaning
Oooo ahh... the pain is tremendous
Where the hell is my prescription...of codeine?

But when will I speak, how long until my mouth feels natural?
How long will they bleed, when will they heal, where's the real meal
? how do you feel? how do you feel? how do you feel? how do you
Feel?

I feel good...i feel great...there's no pain...there's no ache
I feel good...i feel great...just let me recuperate

Because the codeine has left me drowsy, leave me be...just let me sleep!
