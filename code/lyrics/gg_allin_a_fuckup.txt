Song:

I never needin' anyone but me
I never fit in with my family
I'm a fuckup I guess I always be
Just an outcast in society
You're a fuckup X 6
I never do alike what you want me to
I never fit in with anyone that's true
Everything I touch always turns to rot
Everybody hates me say I'm a fuckup
Why don't you just fuck off and die
Who needs you anyway
Why don't you just leave me alone
Suck my bone
I never went to church I never learned the rule.
I always hated sports I always hated school.
Everything I did was against the rules.
I got blamed for everything I always got the screw.
Why don't you all fuck off and die
Who needs you anyway
Why don't you just leave me alone
Suck my bone
