Song:

Godless
Lawless
Stifled
Bondage

The grubs are fastened
In sackcloth and ashes
We are the children
Of amnesia in heaven

Their cries go unrequited
Lost in the deathly air
Mute sky and the godless black
Soft secrets of despair

Grim breath
Blistered stitch
Picked to bits
Corrupt what's left

Demons making monsters
Inject them with the toxin
Like Ishmael and the whale
Impale, impale, impale

Lord of Lies
Kingdom of Bones
Starve their Minds
Atom to Adam

You who hate
You who rape
And contaminates
Atom to Adam

The grubs are fastened
In sackcloth and ashes
We are the children
Of amnesia of heaven

Inside this broken body
My soul is cold and throbbing
Subversive verses leave my lips
God is an atheist

Iron kiss
Thickest drug
Eat the meat
Of the young

Demons making monsters
Inject them with the poison
Like Ishmael and the whale
Impale, impale, impale

Lord of Lies
Kingdom of bones
Starve their minds
Atom to Adam

You who hate
You who rape
And contaminates
Atom to Adam

The grubs are fastened
In sackcloth and ashes
We are the children
Of amnesia from heaven

Fucking shitsucking cowards
Building towers of Babel
Gagging your servants
With perverted gavels
Atom to Adam to atom to Adam to atom

Trap them and brand them like cattle
And shackle their spirits

Godless
Lawless
Stifled
Bondage

We are the victims of
The amnesia of heaven
Do unto
Do unto
Do unto
Others

Their cries go unrequited
Lost in the deathly air
Fist-fuck their face
God doesn't care

Grim breath
Blistered stitch
Picked to bits
Corrupt what's left

Demons making monsters
Inject them with the toxin
Like Ishmael and the whale
Impale, impale, impale

Lord of lies
Kingdom of bones
Starve their minds
Atom to Adam

You who hate
You who rape
And contaminates
Atom to Adam

Admit what you did
Admit what you did

Godless
Lawless
Godless
Mea Culpa
