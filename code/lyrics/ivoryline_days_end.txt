Song:

Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep, sweep, sweep
Or sleep, sleep, sleeping hearts.
Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep.

We should scream "thank you"
With every waking breath.
And cry "mercy! mercy" at every day's end.
Yet we remain quiet and comfortable in our A to B lives.
We're so quiet and comfortable in our A to B lives.

Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep, sweep, sweep
Or sleep, sleep, sleeping hearts.
Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep.

It is then when we will cry for forgiveness,
Yet not understand the weight of our words
Nor the depth of His love.
But he will deliver. Failure is beneath him.
Yes, he will deliver. Failure's not an option.

Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep, sweep, sweep
Or sleep, sleep, sleeping hearts.
Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep.

Wake, wake the complacent.
Hey you, yeah you.
And will the weak of mind to warn the wicked.
Wake! Wake the complacent.
Hey you, yeah you,
And will the weak of mind
To warn the wicked, so wicked.

Wake the complacent and will the weak,
And let's not forget to warn the...

Our complacency won't last much longer.
An urgency will sweep.
Until that day I will laugh dance and sing,
For I know that, that day is soon to be seen
