Song:

At first I kinda liked it bein' here with you
Bein' what you needed Lord and leadin' you to
When it started changin' with every passing day
I went searchin' but I couldn't found the answer
All I want from you is away
Oh you hung around and you watched my show but you wouldn't pay
You'll always be just what you are no matter what I say
All I want from you is away
[ guitar - steel ]
Ah one thing that I will say cause I kinda think I should
Feelin' like a woman in your arms it sure felt good
And if I look behind me and I see you there
That's enough for me cause I've already been there
All I want from you is away...
