Song:

Woke up in the afternoon
Must be the tenth time in a row
Woke up in a strange room
Wearing a face you didn't know
Sat up on your elbows
Wiping the sleep out of your eyes
There's somebody with you
You don't recall or recognize

What the hell am I supposed to do
With all of this time
(Saint marie?) what have you done to me
Used to be just fine
Now I know just how the black cat feels

Staring up at the ceiling
Dreaming of escape
A welcome welcome home
(Letters?) light up the neon
This must be the place
And everything must go

You got what you wanted
And realized a little too late
That you are no longer
The one that you were
When you first wanted in

What the hell am I dying to trying to forget
(Saint marie?) what have you done to me
Lost inside your head
And I know just how the black cat feels

Staring up at the ceiling
Dreaming of escape
A welcome welcome home
(Letters?) light up the neon
This must be the place
And everything must go

Twirl your big top hat
Round and around
Your walking cane
Cuz this isn't over
(Wave the invisible orchestrate?)

Staring up at the ceiling
Dreaming of escape
A welcome welcome home
(Letters?) light up the neon
This must be the place
And everything must go
