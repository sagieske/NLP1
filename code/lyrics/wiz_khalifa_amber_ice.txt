Song:

[Hook:]
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away

[Verse:]
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't remember going to sleep
But I do know that these louis's go in my feet
And the critics they found how these lyrics do go over beats
Twenty-k shopping when dude go overseas
Smoking weed in the most expensive suite
Even though we ain't supposed to be living anywhere close to these people
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people
Don't wish that on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em
And keep positive energy and have a smoke for 'em
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my n****s
Never seen a ghost in person, now she riding in one
Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures
That's like fifty g's a person if you ridin' with us
To the sky's limits
Roll some weed, and get high with winners
My n****s eating when it's time for dinner

[Hook:]
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
