Song:

Pain it's only a little pain
It'll be gone in a couple of days
Or maybe a life or two
Heart it's only my poor heart
Just that little thing you tore apart
It ain't no headline news

[Chorus:]

But a grown woman should've known better
Than to treat me like some old lipstick
You use up and throw away
Hey, hey, hey

Time I wish I could turn back time
To when you were just a child
And teach you a thing or two
About love it's okay if you wanna give up
But there's a way to leave someone
And you don't have to be so cruel

[Chorus:]

But a grown woman should've known better
Than to treat me like some old dish rag
You use up and throw away
Hey, hey, hey

You're supposed to treat your lover
At least as good as your neighbor
So how could you, a grown woman
Not know no better

I ain't no lipstick you use up and throw away
Cause you're ready for another shade
Hey, hey, hey

You should've known better
Cause you're a grown woman
