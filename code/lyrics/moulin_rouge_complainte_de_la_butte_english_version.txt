Song:

The too pale moon poses a tiara on your red hair
The too brown moon spills glory on your tattered petticoat
The too pale moon carresses the whites of your uninterested eyes
Princess of the street
You are welcome in my broken heart

The staircase up to the hillock is hard on the miserable
The wings of the mill protect the lovers

My little mandigotte, I sense your little hand
That finds mine
I sense your breast and your slender waist,
I forget my sorrow
I feel on your breath a scent of fever of malnourished children
And in your caress, I feel an ecstasy that overwhelms me.

The staircase up to the hillock is hard on the miserable
The wings of the mill protect the lovers

And that's why she scampers, the moon who floats
The princess, also
La la lala la, la la lala la,
My dreams bloom

The staircase up to the hillock is hard on the miserable
The wings of the mill protect the lovers
