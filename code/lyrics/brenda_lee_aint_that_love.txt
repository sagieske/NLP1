Song:

(are. Charles)

Now baby when you sigh, I wanna sigh with you.
And when you cry, I wanna cry some too.
Now, ain't that love, oh, ain't that love that
I feel in my heart for you?

When your friends turn their back on you
I'll be here, just to see you through.
Ain't that love, ain't that love, ain't that love
Now, ain't that love, baby, that I feel in my heart for you?

When you walk, I wanna walk with you,
And when you talk, I wanna talk some, too.
Now, ain't that love, oh, ain't that love that
I feel in my heart for you?

If you ever, ever need a friend, I'll be with you,
Yes until the end. Now, ain't that love, ain't that love,
Don't you know baby, don't you know now
Ain't that love baby that I feel in my heart for you?

Baby, won't you let me hold your hand?
I wanna squeeze you as tight as I can,
Baby, don't you need me by your side,
To Protect you and be your guy?

Baby' I'm so in love with you,
I'd do anything, you tell me to,
Now, ain't that love, ain't that love,
C'mon now, ain't that love now, ain't that love,
Baby, that I fell in my heart for you?
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you.
Yeah, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you.
