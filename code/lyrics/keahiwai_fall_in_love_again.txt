Song:

I could be the one your waiting for
I could be the only one to love you like before
You know that we both made mistakes
We fooled around and played around
Straight along the way
Maybe we just need a second chance
I really think that we could make it last
Maybe we can

~*~ Chorus ~*~
Light in a candle in the wind low
Turn the lights down real low
Marvin Gaye on the stereo
I know we can fall in love again
Lock the door, throw away the keys
No one else just you and me
Make tonight a reality
I know we can fall in love again

Oooooo

We don't have to hide the way we feel
(hide the way we feel)
We don't have to make pretend
On what we had was real
We don't have to worry about the mistakes we made
(mistakes we made)
All of that's behind us now
Theres nothing in the way
Maybe we just need a second chance
(maybe we just need a second chance)
I really think that we can make it last
Baby we can..

~*~ Repeat Chorus ~*~

I don't wanna spend my whole life without you
Just wishin that I had tried one last time.........

I believe we can fall in love again
(repeat 8 times)

Maybe we just need a second chance
(maybe we just need a second chance)
I really think that we can make it last

~*~Repeat Chorus~*~

I believe we can fall in love again
(repeats and fades till ending)
