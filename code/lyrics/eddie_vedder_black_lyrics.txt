Song:

Hey... Oooh...
Sheets of empty canvas,
Untouched sheets of clay...
Were laid spread out before me
As her body once did.

Oh all five horizons
Revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun

Now the air I tasted and breathed
Has taken a turn
Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything?

All the pictures have
All been washed in black,
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear?

Oh and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything?
All the pictures have, all been washed in black,
Tattooed everything...

All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll
Be... Yeah...

I hope someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be star,
In somebody else's sky,
But why, why, why
Can't it be, oh can't it be mine?
