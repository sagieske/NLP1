Song:

Dear God, will no one get out of here alive?
Lost your head in this
New medicine floating in the sky

Heavy clouds come crashing down
Harder every time
Sink or swim in these loaded fantasies
Flooding out your mind

Fear God, from now you've gone
And lost your sight of land
Drunk with power, your final hour is running out of sand

Hung by your self-righteous hands
Get ready to meet your maker, now
Backlashing, back trash you liar
Backlashing, back at you, run coward

Backlashing, back at you

Bare the truth, when the storm comes through
With hell and high tides
Tip the scales and drive the nails in
Deeper every time

Dear God, will anyone get out of here alive?
Dead head again, due to medicine
Heavy clouds collide

Hung by your self-righteous hands
Get ready to meet your maker, now
Backlashing, back at you liar
Backlashing, back at you, run coward

Backlashing back at you, back at you, back at you

Hung by your self-righteous hands
Get ready to meet your maker, now
Backlashing, back at you liar
Backlashing, back at you, run coward
