Song:

We're at the tip-top, yeah, we're not getting any better than this
I'm out of lines, girl, We're not getting any smoother than this
But could you blame me if I... If I... If I...
Took you all for prisoner with just one line, one lie

Because I'll be the preacher to all his converts
"donate now to my rightful cause"
But what good is a quick healing to go?
If the lesson is never learned it's just like stitches for show

They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest

We're at the ground floor
But our numbers they only get higher from here
It's not the failure, but the cost of success
Is the thing I can't help but fear

This isn't righteous
It's a mid-life crisis
I'm not compelled
You just convinced me to write this
It's for the greater good
'Cause I'd rather be great than good

They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest

"we're at the ground floor"
"it's not the failure"

You're skin was appealing wallpaper
Now you're skin is just peeling wallpaper
You're skin was appealing wallpaper

You're skin was appealing wallpaper
Now you're skin is just peeling wallpaper
You're skin was appealing wallpaper
Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling

You're skin was appealing wallpaper
Now you're skin is just peeling wallpaper
You're skin was appealing wallpaper
Now your skin is just peeling, your skin is just peeling
Your skin is just peeling off!

They say the Carolina heat
Isn't something that keeping a cool head can beat
But don't discount their winter winds
And all the cold shoulders that the slightest draft lets in
And with empty stomachs and hungry eyes
Our only choice was to swallow pride
But I guess, I guess you just ate much better than the rest
