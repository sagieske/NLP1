Song:

When will this end

[Verse:]
Get into a well of
A tainted stain
Got the beating of that
Will we dig you
When will this end

It's coming unto the surface now
Standing on the throne on consequences
A lesson learned in life
Cast us the pirates
That plague your life

No one can, understand
Behind the silence within you
Something has got to kill

[Chorus:]
Forgiveness is all we have
When the healing goes on
Nothing else will give you
A peace of mind

[Verse:]
He's been holding on to anger and hatred
The feeling that things will never change

It is to what we say
Thinking that no one could ever understand
All the pain that you hide
You're burning inside
To hold you down

[Chorus:]
Forgiveness is all we have
Are you willing to just let go
Nothing else will give you
A peace of mind

You can't blame yourself
You cannot lie
To think that you're the only one
You cannot hide,
You cannot run
From what's been said and done

[Chorus:]
Forgiveness is all we have
Are you willing to just let go
Nothing else will give you
A peace of mind
