Song:

Lookin' out on the morning rain
(Ah-ooo)
I used to feel so uninspired
(Ah-ooo)
And when I knew I had to face another day
(Ah-ooo)
Lord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to my piece of mind

'cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

'cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Oh baby what you done to me!
(What you done to me!)
You make me feel so good inside
(Good inside)
And I just wanna be
(Wanna be)
Close to you
You make me feel so alive

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

You make me feel (hey)
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
Fades-
You make me feel (hey)
You make me feel...
