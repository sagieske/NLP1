Song:

Alice in Wonderland
How do you get to Wonderland
Over the hill or underland
Or just behind a tree

When clouds go rolling by
They roll away and leave the sky
Where is the land behind the eye

Where do the stars go
Where is the crescent moon
They must be somewhere in the sunny afternoon

Alice in Wonderland
Where is the path to Wonderland
Over the hill or here or there
I wonder where
