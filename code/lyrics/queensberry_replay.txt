Song:

Iґm to nice for the city
To honest for the game
All the two faced little let downs
Theyґre alle one in the same
When ridding ion the track and field
Thereґs no room for mistakes
Iґve given everythinh I have to give
And I think Iґm ok

So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
If youґre not gonna change
You can keep it on the replay
So sadd but true
So sad that you
Can't stand up and walk away
So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
Iґm gonna be okay

Itґs too cold in the city
Itґs too dark of a life
Some how we end up molded
Iґm not better than the city
I just wann show something more
I deserve a little spac eto bring something out
Of this love we hate like war

So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
If youґre not gonna change
You can keep it on the replay
So sadd but true
So sad that you
Can't stand up and walk away
So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
Iґm gonna be okay

When you smile
It doesnґt have to be so serios
Let it go, I know of everything
That stands betweens us

So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
If youґre not gonna change
You can keep it on the replay
So sadd but true
So sad that you
Can't stand up and walk away
So you can keep it on the replay
Keep it on the replay
Iґm gonna be okay
