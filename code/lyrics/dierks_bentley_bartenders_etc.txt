Song:

Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids

Bartenders listen when you talk
And barstools are there when you can't walk
And I'll always make a waitress my best
Until the music stops and closin' time begins

Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids

Outside lies a heart that's been broke
And in here it's a world of song and smoke
That way my eyes and ears can lie to me
While I drink another shot of make believe

Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids
A jukebox and a pocket full of change
Just a few of my favorite things
Bartenders, Barstools and Barmaids

Bartenders, barstools and barmaids
