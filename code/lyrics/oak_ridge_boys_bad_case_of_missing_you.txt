Song:

Lonely;
Come hold me:
Show me that you're lonely too.
Oh, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.
Help me;
Tell me,
Honey, what can I do?
Oh, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.

I been fillin' my time with a whole lotta nothin'.
Twenty-five hours a day livin' without out your lovin'.

Lonely, (Lonely.)
Come hold me: (Hold me.)
Show me that you're lonely too.
Oh, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.
Help me; (Help me.)
Tell me, (Tell me.)
Honey, what can I do?
Sweet, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.

I tried every pill an' magic potion.
Until they find a cure, I just got to keep on hopin'.

Lonely, (Lonely.)
Come hold me: (Hold me.)
Show me that you're lonely too.
Oh, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.
Help me; (Help me.)
Tell me, (Tell me.)
Honey, what can I do?
Sweet, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.

Oh, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.

Sweet, baby, I got a bad case of missin' you.
