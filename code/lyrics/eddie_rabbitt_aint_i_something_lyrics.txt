Song:

Here I go again
Losing control again
I need you bad again
Now, ain't I something?

One more time again
I'm flying blind again
Into the flames again
Now, ain't I something?

You'd think that I have lived and learned
After all the times that I've been burned by you
But I'm still lost somewhere between the agony and ecstasy
Of loving you
Mmm, loving you
Ain't I something?
Ain't I something?

Trusting you again
I'll be your fool again
Just like I've always been
Now, ain't I something?

One more time again
I'm flying blind again
Into the flames again
Now, ain't I something?
Now, ain't I something?
Now, ain't I something?
Mmm, ain't I something?
Mmm, ain't I something?
