Song:

Yeah, one, two, one, two
We got that hot one from the chipmunks, come on

Ain't no party like a chipmunk party
'Cause the chipmunk party don't stop
It's just me and my boys, sure to bring the noise
You know that we make it hot

They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot

Step inside the party, y'all know our name
Paparazzi outside, glad we came
Gotta take some photos with a couple of fans
If you don't show love, they will be in the stands

Back to the dance flow, getting it poppin'
Bodies are moving and heads are boppin'
All looks back and we turned it out
'Cause you know what the chipmunks are all about

Ain't no party like a chipmunk party
'Cause the chipmunk party don't stop
It's just me and my boys, sure to bring the noise
You know that we make it hot

They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot

We go where we wanna go, flow how we wanna flow
If you don't know, well now you know
Having a good time is what were after
Chillin' with friends for fun and laughter

If you wanna roll you know where we're at
Spotlight lookin' cool somewhere in the back
Dave would be mad if he saw us laugh
Standing in the spotlight with our voices loud

Ain't no party like a chipmunk party
'Cause the chipmunk party don't stop
It's just me and my boys, sure to bring the noise
You know that we make it hot

They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot

Yo, Classic, give it up to Alvin
Show them how you do it, alright
Yo, you're ready Theodore, yeah
Cool, Simon, you with it
That's right, come on

Drivin' down sunset lookin' for describin'
My little dude's ain't dead, just ain't hot
Rollin' with the crew, the guest list says
Alvin and the chipmunks plus 82

VIP action, children relaxing
Superstar fashion, cameras flashing
Alvin, Simon, Theodore too
Do it like this every time we come through

Ain't no party like a chipmunk party
'Cause the chipmunk party don't stop
It's just me and my boys, sure to bring the noise
You know that we make it hot

They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot, hot
They make it hot
