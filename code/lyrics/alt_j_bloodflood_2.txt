Song:

[Verse:]
Heat shimmers
Hips quiver
Open smother
Lipped lover

[Hook 1:]
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Razor blades on a melted toothbrush
Slash, slash/Assassin de la police

[Verse 2:]
Heat shimmers
Silky glistener
Open smother
Lipped lover

[Hook 2:]
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Silent knife, unholy knife
I've fallen for the black outside my window

[Outro:]
On the C-O-double-M-O-N
A flood of blood to the heart
Quelea, quelea
