Song:

Is it any wonder now,
The stars around me,
Are not the brightest of them all,
From standing proud,
To falling like a domino, down,
And out somehow,
All that I remember now,
About being by your side,
Is having just the most amazing time,
But nothing lasts forever,
We're just human after all...
I feel stronger now but it's not easy,
To feel the pride after the fall,
Feeling like I've gotta go,
So it's looking like I'll never know,
Why you left at all,
It'll hit you with a power,
At anytime, at any hour,
But we can learn to make it,
If we all stand tall,
It doesn't have to matter,
We're just human after all...
I work it out and I feel somehow,
That you were bringing out the best in me,
So why do I feel down,
When changes always do you good,
Am I feeling like I should?
From standing proud,
To falling like a domino, down,
And out somehow,
It'll hit you with a power,
At anytime, at any hour,
Let it be a lesson to you all,
Your crying doesn't matter at all,
It doesn't matter at all, we're just human,
It doesn't matter at all, we're just human,
It doesn't matter at all, we're just human
