Song:

When I'm all broke down
Headin' for disaster
And I'm standin' 'round
Tryin' to find a clue
And my head is tired
Searchin' for the answers
Can't figure out
How I'm gonna get through the next 10 minutes

(Chours)
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know (oh)
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know (oh)

Oh-oh (Repeats 4x)

When I'm burnt out
Need a place to run to
No one hears me shout
Lost and all alone
And I'm losing ground
No one understands me
Can't figure out
What I'm gonna do cause' I just can't take it

(Chours)
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know (oh)
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do)
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know (oh)

Oh-oh (Repeats 4x)

(Lil' Mama Cut's in with her Part)

Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know (oh)
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you (what I feel for you)
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do)
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to (where you take me to)
Don't you know (oh)

Oh-oh (Repeats 4x)
