Song:

Take care
We know that you want to break down
They know that your losin' your edge
Come Around
You know that it's moving too fast
Your out of bounds
Your too late
To sound the alarm in your head
To break up, to break up
And turn this thing around

We can't go back
We've come too far
We can't hold back
We've gone too far

And when it comes, you will know
It's time to run

Beware
You know that these people aren't friends
And they only have your worst interests at heart
You knew they were gonna slit throats and roll heads
Your too late
Take cover in a minute or less
You f****d up
You f****d up

We can't go back
We've come too far
We can't hold back
We've gone too far

And when it comes, you will know
It's time to run.
