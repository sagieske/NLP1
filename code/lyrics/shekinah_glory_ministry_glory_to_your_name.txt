Verse 1:
Glory to Your name, oh Lord my God
As I lift up my hands
I magnify Your name
I give you my heart, my mind, my soul
Oh Lord take control
Have Your way in me, oh Lord
Ooh

Verse 2:
Lord there is none, no where like You
Oh how I worship You
In spirit and in truth
Come rain on me refresh my soul
Come down and fill this place
Come and breathe on me
Oh Lord

(Repeat verses)

Vamp:
We give You glory (glory)
We give You honor (honor)
We give You worship (worship)
All in this place
(Repeat)
