Song:

{Charlie}
I, I'm not sure just how to say this to you
The words just don't come out right
But that doesn't mean that I don't feel somethin' for ya
You gotta understand that love
Love was something I knew nothing about
Until I met you
But you, girl
You're the one that turned my heart around
And for that I love you

{Pre-Chorus}
I'm walking on the sky
Girl you're making me high
My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oo damn I'm mesmerized

I'm floatin' on the sky
Girl you're making me high
My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oo damn I'm mesmerized

{Chorus}
I tried everything I knew from before
She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
She got me floatin'

I had to say do do, do do, do do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
If you're in love let me hear you say do do, do do, do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
If you're in love...

{Justin}
Said hey, girl
I just can't seem to take my eyes off of you
(But who could blame me?)
'Cause when I look into those baby blues
I can feel my heart fall to the ground
And for that I love you

{Pre-Chorus}
I'm walking on the sky
Girl you're making me high
My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oo damn I'm mesmerized

I'm floatin' on the sky
Girl you're making me high
My feet can hardly touch the ground
Oo damn I'm mesmerized

{Chorus}
I tried everything I knew from before
She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
She got me floatin'
I had to say do do, do do, do do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
If you're in love let me hear you say do do, do do, do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
If you're in love...

{Will.I.Am}
Girl you got me walkin' on the sky
Sho' nuff make a brother feel high
And it feels like I'm floatin'
But I ain't smokin' dope
One day I hope you could tell me why
Why the sun don't shine when you're gone
Baby, you've still got that thing to turn me on
Like the first time I peeped ya
I wanted to freak ya
And getcha up outta your thong
I wanna freak ya, freak ya, freak freak ya
Get kinky, put your booty on a speaker
And when my waist go boom
And the bass go boom
Can I se-quence the beat to treat ya?
'Cause it's seven in the morning and it just don't stop
And we've been at it since eleven o'clock
The chocolate rabbit with the hippity hop
Makin' love letcha flow...

I tried everything I knew from before
She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
She got me floatin'
I had to say do do, do do, do do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
I'm floatin'
Do do, do do, (Floatin' on the sky, yea yea) do do do do do do
Say do do do do do do
If you're in love
Do do, do do, do do do do do
Say do do do do do do ...
If you're in love...
