Song:

Now I've never stepped through the doors of a barroom or tasted the flavor of wine
And I've never danced to the songs on a jukebox or held someone that wasn't mine

But there's always the first time and if you don't change
Then I guess the first time can't be arranged can't be arranged

[Banjo]

Now I've never dressed for the eyes of the stranger to sow seeds of lust in his mind
And I've never walked down backroad of temptation to leave dirty footprints behind
But there's always the first time...
