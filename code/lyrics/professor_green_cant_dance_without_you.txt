Song:

[Verse 1, Professor Green]
A little birdy told me that I need to clean up
Remove the C, the L, the N and the A
Then put a D after the E and that's me, blud
How you mean, blud?
Sorry for complicating things, what I mean is I'm E'd up
Oh my god, Stephen, that's enough
Oh my lord, these are good
All I wanna hear now's Ebeneezer Goode
A little something to remind me of the 90s
Back when Es were good
I don't think I ever wanna leave the shubs

[Pre-Hook, Professor Green]
All I need now is somebody's daughter
Nothing could put me in a foul mood
Just lost 3 quid on a bottle of water
But I don't mind because I just found you

[Hook, Whinnie Williams]
I can't dance without you
You know, I never could
You always have this special way
Of making life feel good
I can't dance without you
Although I know I should
You always have this special way
Of making life feel good

[Verse 2, Professor Green]
I'm in a raving mood, wading through
The crowd while they're playing my favourite tune
Favourite tune? Ok, I'm lying
I don't know the name of the song that I'm raving to
A raving loon, as long as I've got music
I'll be raving until I shave my gooch
I already saw the chick I wanna dance with
And I've been aiming when to make my move
Just when I went to move on it
A man popped up but I ain't too bothered
Because I make legs spread like the Bubonic plague
Come on babe, I know you want it, ayy

[Pre-Hook, Professor Green]

[Hook, Whinnie Williams]

[Bridge, Professor Green]
No pics or I'm posing a threat
Look at my boat, it's a mess
Although right now I'm in the zone and I'm bless
You can bet by Tuesday, I'll be an emotional wreck
All alone in my room with the lights out
Watching a rom com and crying my eyes out
Wondering why I bother with you
I wanna quit, it's just I can't dance without you

[Hook, Whinnie Williams]

[Outro, Professor Green]
If I'm being honest, I can't dance at all, init
I've got two left feet
I can sing though, trust me
No autotune needed
You always have this special way
Of making life feel-
Alright, maybe not
