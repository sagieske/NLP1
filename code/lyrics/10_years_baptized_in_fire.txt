Song:

So is your life with worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?

Over exposure of repetition blinds ambition slowly
Frozen in motion the time is ticking by with every moment
No one takes notice of their incandescent adolescents glowing
Sweet songs won't last too long

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Older, and older, these wandering eyes never close up
A funeral for failure now your final hour as a coward's over
Sad songs won't last too long

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Baptized in fire
Baptized in fire before you expire

So is your life worth savin' now?
Bound to these broken memories

So is your life worth saving?
Or is your picture fading?
Bound to these broken memories
This story has no ending

Baptized in fire
Baptized in fire before you expire
