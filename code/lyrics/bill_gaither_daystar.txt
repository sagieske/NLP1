Song:

Lily of the Valley,
Let Your sweet aroma fill my life.
Rose of Sharon, show me
How to grow in beauty in God's sight.
Fairest of ten thousand,
Make me a reflection of Your light.
Daystar, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door.
Let Your Word speak to me;
Show me what I've never seen before.
Lord, I want to be a witness
You can take what's wrong and make it right.
Daystar, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.

Lord, I see a world that's dying,
Wounded by the master of deceit,
Groping in the darkness,
Haunted by the years of past defeat;
But then I see You standing near me, Lord,
Shining with compassion in Your eyes.
Jesus, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.

Lead me, Lord, I'll follow
Anywhere You open up the door.
Let Your Word speak to me;
Show me what I've never seen before.
Lord, I want to be a witness
You can take what's wrong and make it right.
Daystar, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.

Daystar, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.

Jesus, shine down on me,
Let Your love shine through me in the night.
