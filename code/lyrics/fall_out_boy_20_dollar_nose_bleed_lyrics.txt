Song:

Have you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monestary
Go out and preach and preach on manic streets?
Where will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane, passenger plane

Permanent Jet Lag
Please take me back, please take be back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in, please let me in
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
And don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in

It feels like 14 carats but no clarity
When I look at the man who would be king
The man who would be king goes to the
Desert the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said
We won, oh, we won

Permanent Jet Lag
Please take me back, please take me back
I'm a stray dog sick
Please let me in (Please let me in)
The mad key's tripping
Singing vows before we exchange smoke rings

Give me a pen
Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
And don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in

B-b-b-b-Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My B-b-b-b-Benzedrine now

B-b-b-b-Benzedrine
My, my, my Benzedrine
My B-b-b-b-Benzedrine now

Only one book really matters
The rest of the proof is on the television

Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in
I wanna blow off steam and
Call me Mr. Benzedrine (Mr. Benzedrine)
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in

Have you ever wanted to disappear?

It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Around my neck and around me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my car
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me: I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring
And the kids are snoring
And my ankle's in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing...
And I said, I said
