Song:

To hell with boys creepin' up slowly
Swingin' them shovels 'round
Diggin' up words of pleasure
From evil hollow ground
O - an' here's one now girl
The devil is in his eye
You'd better start stirring up soil boy
Or hear e'are you'll lye
Whispered to you in the dark
And I think you heard me say
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kind of way
Ye charlie's neat an' charlie's keen but
David he's a dandy
David he's a nice young man
He feeds the girls on candy
Whispered to you in the dark
And all that sordid gain
Let's say goodbye like we said hello
In a friendly kinda way
Now what I done's my damage
An' what you do is your'n
Y'all got nothin' on me
But i'll take that there
Crown of scorn
