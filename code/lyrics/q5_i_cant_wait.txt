Song:

Late at night, feeling so right,
All my senses exploding inside
Drivin' home, feeling so low...
I can't take it much longer alone
I need you so bad, I've just got to have...
Thoughts of you feed my desire
I want to believe when you say that
You need... Soon I'll be inside of you...

[Chorus:]
Well I can't wait
I can't take it
Got to hold you
I can't wait
I can't take it
Got to hold you

You and me passions free...
Heat running down your sweet skin
Fantasies rage inside a cage
That quivers as I'm comin' in
Don't take it away, I love how we play
On each other's emotions in tune
I need you so bad it's drivin' me mad
I've just got to make love to you

[Chorus:]

Hold on to me I've come to see the
Tenderness locked inside you
Just one more time... Give me a sign so
I know that you're feeling it too
I won't let go lovin' you so,
We only live for each other
I need you so bad it's drivin' me mad
I've just got to make love to you

[Chorus:]
