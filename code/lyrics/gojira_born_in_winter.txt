Song:

Before all things reborn again
You learn the painful breath of time
Cold mourning stretches out your arms
To the mighty warmth of the golden sun
Seem all have gone insane for gold
All was created out of the night
We're all born from the burst of a star
The day you'll come to life you'll realize
Expanding force to life where you belong
And in the winter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright
One day you'll walk the world and keep in mind
The heart you've been given in winter time
And through the bitter cold, with opened eyes
You'll find the strength to fight and stand upright
