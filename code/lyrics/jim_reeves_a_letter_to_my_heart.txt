Song:

Dear heart, there is something I must tell you
Something sad and so hard for me to say
For I know how much you always loved her
And how you always hoped that she'd come back someday

But day after day my hopes grow dimmer
As I watched life and love passing me by
And the life I live is empty and so lonely
But you just lived for her and slowly let me die

You know she left me for another
So give her up, let her go, let it be
Dear heart, if you won't stop beating for her
Then dear heart, stop beating for me

You know she left me for another
So give her up, let her go, let it be
Dear heart, if you won't stop beating for her
Then dear heart, stop beating for me
