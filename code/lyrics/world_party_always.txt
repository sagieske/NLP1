Song:

I gotta go, got some people to see
They're gonna show their invention to me
Say it'll save lots of my precious time
Open up the inside of my mind to

Always, always, always
Always, always, always

I'd like to call you but just now and then
I get the feeling that I need a good friend
I'll do the same if it's getting to you
Give us a call and I'll give you a clue

But I gotta go, got some people to see
Don't wanna keep them waiting for me
Just remember what I said to you now
The clock is ticking but your life will go on for

Always, always, always
Always, always, always
Always, always, always
Always, always, always

Look at me running while I bury what's inside
Whence comes this feeling that there's so much I should hide
The simple life is something I just want to do
The clock is ticking but I want to be with you

Always, always, always
Always, always, always
Always, always, always
Always, always, always
Always, always, always

I gotta go, got some people to see
They're gonna show their invention to me
Say it'll save lots of my precious time
Open up the inside of my mind

I'd like to call you but just now and then
When I get the feeling that I need a good friend
