Song:

(Sindarin)
Uich gwennen na 'wanath ah na dh–Ωn.
An uich gwennen na ringyrn ambar hen.
Boe naid bain gwannathar,
Boe cuil ban firitha.
Boe naer gwannathach, [...]

(English)
'You are not bound to loss and silence.
For you are not bound to the circles of this world.
All things must pass away,
All life is doomed to fade...
Sorrowing you must go, [and yet you are not without hope]. '
