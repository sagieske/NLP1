Song:

A '57 Chevy, Red and White
American Beauty
Levi blue jeans twisin' all night
American Beauty
California girls, Rocky Mountain High
A Texas star in a cowboy's eyes
Shinin' like a diamond from sea to sea
American beauty, American beauty

A Zebco Fishing Pole Fishin dowstream
American Beauty
Strummin on a '48 D-18,
American Beauty
Hot dogs, baseball, popcorn, football
A cheer for victory
Nascar Racecar number 3
American beauty, American beauty

From North to South
From coast to coast
You can see it everywhere you go

Miles of Wheat fields rolling to the skies
American beauty
Great white spaceship, Enterprise
American Beauty
Stampede of buffalo, Sitting bull,
Geronimo,
An eagle on wing
From Alabama with a banjo on my knee
American beauty, American beauty

She stands in the harbor
In the city of dreams
American Beauty
Prettiest face
I've ever seen
American Beauty
And she holds a torch
And she wont let go
I love her with all my heart
And soul
Id give my life
To keep her free
American beauty, American beauty
American beauty, American beauty
American beauty
