Song:

(Clarke / Macaulay)

Took you from Dakota from the Black Hills to the plains
I brought you up a lady and the right way to behave
Turned my pockets inside-out and not a dime was saved
And now you're trying to decide whether to go or stay

Don't let a little thing like love keep on bringing you down, my babe
Or ever change the plans you made
Don't let a little thing like tears keep on turning you 'round, my babe
You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down, you look for the brighter lights uptown
Don't let a little thing like me ever stand in your way

Took you on a fast train across the Rio Grande
A Mexicano wedding with a Tijuana band
You blew my whole life savings and all the gold I'd panned
So if you're trying to find a way to say your sweet goodbyes

Chorus

You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down
You look for the right to light the town
Don't let a little thing like me
Ever stand in your way
Don't let a little thing like love
