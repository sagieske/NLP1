Song:

It's undeniable, that we should be together
It's unbelievable, how I used to say that I'd fall never
It's basis you need to know you know just how I feel
And let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal

One: you're like a dream come true
Two: just wanna be with you
Three: girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four: repeat steps 1 thru 3
Five: make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

It's so incredible the way things work themselves out
And unemotional once you know what it's all about
And undesirable for us to be apart
I never would have made it very far
'Cause you know you hold the keys to me heart 'cause

One: you're like a dream come true
Two: just wanna be with you
Three: girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four: repeat steps 1 thru 3
Five: make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

Say farewell to the darkened night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline just in the nick of time

One: you're like a dream come true
Two: just wanna be with you
Three: girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four: repeat steps 1 thru 3
Five: make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one

One: you're like a dream come true
Two: just wanna be with you
Three: girl, it's plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four: repeat steps 1 thru 3
Five: make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one
