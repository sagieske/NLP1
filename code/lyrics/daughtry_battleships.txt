Song:

[Verse:]
I'm sinking inside
And the mass and lines are broken down tonight
I swallow my pride
But we're drowning in the ocean
And it's tearing my heart open baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're high, then we're low
First it's yes, then it's no
And we're changing like the tides
Yea, but I want you, I need you
And I guarantee you we'll make out alive

[Chorus:]
Â‘Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

[Hook:]
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes

[Verse:]
Bombs fly through the air
And I know that we're both playing not so fair
Oh, show... Show me you care
Got my white flag up and it's waving
Cause you know this loves worth saving baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're high, then we're low
First it's yes, then it's no
And we're changing like the tides
Yea, but I want you, I need you
And I guarantee you we'll make out alive

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

[Hook:]
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom

And we love, yea love
(Boom b-boom boom b-boom)
And we love, yea love
(Boom b-boom boom b-boom)

I'm sinking inside
Cause we've finally put our weapons down tonight

[Chorus:]
Cause I don't wanna fight no more
Even when the waves get rough
I don't wanna see the day we say we've had enough
And I don't wanna fight this war
Bullets coming off our lips
But we stick to our guns and we love like battleships
Like battleships

[Hook:]
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And the cannon goes
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And we love, yea we love
(And the cannon goes)
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
And we love, yea we love
(And the cannon goes)
Boom b-boom boom b-boom boom boom
Boom b-boom boom b-boom
We love like battleships
