Song:

Because I give your wake,
Doesn't give better than it takes
Doesn't give your way
Doesn't give better than it takes
Doesn't know the truth in your
Doesn't know the truth in your

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

You get afford from all this steps
For these lines, can livin' in
You can agive me what I'm after
In this cold situation

But I know more
And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Well they don't know my name

And I go on down town,
Where they don't know my name
