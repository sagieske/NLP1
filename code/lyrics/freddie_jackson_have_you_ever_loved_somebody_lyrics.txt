Song:

Oooh, have you ever...
Have you ever loved, loved, loved

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

Chorus
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh that special feeling
When somebody loves you

You build a fortress around yourself
Your emotions they hide within
You've got your heart securely locked away
And you won't let nobody in

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

Chorus
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you (can you tell me please)
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh that special feeling (don't it feel good)
When somebody loves you

Oh, When you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
'Cuz I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me, too
Can you learn to love me, too

Mmm, I can teach you how to love again (love again)
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

Chorus 2x
