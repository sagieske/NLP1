It was getting late, I was on my own
In a little bar just coming down
When I glanced across, and I saw her face
In a flash of time everything had turned around

She said what's your name, with a lovely smile
Like she's known me all of my life
In a little while, we were touching hands
And then suddenly she was saying goodbye

Chorus:
A little in love, I'm just a little in love
Gotta find her once again
'cos I don't want this to end
Gonna search the city for that pretty girl
Who just might be just a little in love like me

Now I'm sitting here, sipping on my beer
Like a kid again watching that door
Been a long longtime, since I felt this way
And I must admit, everyday I want her more

Chorus:
A little in love, I'm just a little in love
Gotta find her once again
'cos I don't want this to end
Gonna search the city for that pretty girl
Who just might be just a little in love like me
