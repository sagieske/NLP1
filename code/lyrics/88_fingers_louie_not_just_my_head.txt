Song:

You don't listen to a single word
We say things get rougher
Everyday fu***n' arrogance drivin' me crazy
Get back in the mold
And do just what we're told
We cry for change you think
We're crazy it's not just my head [x4]
We're all dead when there's nothing left to live for
We'll all be better off dead
Cuz there's nothing left to live for
