Song:

Say for the last time I won't let you down,
It's hard to escape trapped under the ground.
Fighting ghostly battles here,
And I'm just as blind as you only darkness,
So many years we've fallen victim,
Of what we can not explain anytime.

For everyone has opinions on this world but for me I'm unclear.
Breathe on me now I'm lost in an unknown world feeling cold hearts around me.
Pretending that false encounters are uncertain
But I'm here and I'm standing here.
This time I won't let you down
I know there's a part of you (grab your guns friend)
That you can't take when you come crashing down.
In this moment I will not say one word and i'll hold on too,
I'll take you down
