Song:

(Wale)
I promised Ricky and Milly that I'ma kill it
Running throughout them digits, and Dollars on me I'm on it
I'm running I'm so 100 with every n***a I run with
Tell them n****s we coming, we f-cking it up this summer

(Meek Mill)
And I'm stunting like it ain't nothing, most of these n****s fronting
I pull this Rolly from Travi, and I got this Beamer from nothing
If they ain't talking bout paper, just tell them end of discussion
And now that I'm getting money, my neighbors turn to my cousins

(Wale)
Gold bottles, lot of b*****s
Didn't think I'm sorry I'm such a shallow n***a
The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women
Went out with rats you n****s should be in glass slippers

(Meek Mill)
Ha, and I don't ever ask the price on it
Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it
I told my jeweler get my Mueller, throw some mimes on it
I treat that p-ssy like it's Tina, I go Ike on it
Beat it up, I'm getting heated up
When I say I'm high, I ain't talking weed it up
(Wale)
B***h I'm talking G5, Titobero?,? Out
Beaters on my sneakers, even though I never be with Dex
B and me, train hi up

(Meek Mill)
He lying I'm on papers
But when I beat this s**t off, ima go and buy some Lakers
Yea I'm talking bout that Cali kush, We can work in?
Two bad b*****s in the back, they prettier than ratty look

(Wale)
B***h I'm hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi
In a sauna with some models, we treat them like?
I ain't thugging, I ain't robbing, I'm puffing on my broccoli
Doing 100 in a bucket, be like 20 in a 'rari

(Meek Mill)
And I'm back on this s**t again, Pressie blue like Michigan
I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them
When I get my D12 I'ma be a Sixer then
Riding round with Looney and your sister and your sister's friend

(Wale)
Hold up
Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again
Trying to s**t the n****s is like giving children ritalin
? Sitting in the front, see you in a minute yo
And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope

(Meek Mill)
Big money, I'm talking bad hoes
You n****s full of s**t, f-cking assholes
I'm in this presidential suite, I'm in my bathrobe
Counting 100 grand I put it from my last show
Shitting on them, something I ain't mean to do
These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do
A n***a by a point, here take the nina too
I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do

(Wale)
I think it's genius when Lena do you in a group
Stunting, I'm in the sixth, I call that s**t middle school
High as s**t, I'm in a booth
Never nag them, ima choose
And I don't gotta front, I play these n****s like I wish 'em to
This is where the Wizards play, this is where them b*****s play
Weed a have you falling, and now you scraping up that? Shape
The day a hater treat a n***a like he fake,
Tthat be the day his label treat him like a?

(Meek Mill)
And I'm balling b***h, I'm balling b***h
Me Wale, so hard, this s**t
Get your money budget back, fire all your artists-ess
We be burning everything, they label us as arsonists
Defy the middle of the track, in 106 and Park in here
