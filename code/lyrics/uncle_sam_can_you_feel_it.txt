Song:

Word up, hear ye, hear ye
Uncle Sam, Stone Creek for the 9's
Word is bond, I hope you paid your taxes
'Cause it's time to bring the ruckus
That's what's up, yo Sam, bring it on

I'm gonna steal your love from your man
And put it in my pocket
Turn your heart around never let you down
And then I'm gonna knock it

For all you do, this bud's for you
And give you almost everything you want
Just enough to please you

Are you down? Can you feel it?
I need to know now what you feel
I got love girl, can you feel it?
And no need to hide if it's real

Pop a little Cristal
Even though I don't drink at all
Put your mind in a vibe
Make you feel all funny inside

Hey, no need to worry
'Cause I won't hurt you
'Cause I won't hurt you
Just wanna give you all
The feel-goods you deserve

Girl, I'm gonna be the one
To make this night
A night you won't forget

Are you down? Can you feel it?
I need to know now what you feel
I got love girl, can you feel it?
And no need to hide if it's real

Are you down? Can you feel it?
I need to know now what you feel
I got love girl, can you feel it?
And no need to hide if it's real

Popa Chief threw the stone in the Creek
Can I tempt your tummy with the taste of nuts 'n honey
Can I be your playboy you can be my bunny
Take all my money, treat me like a dummy
And in the morning, wake and rub me on my tummy

Tickle my fancy and guess what
I'll tickle you back with something lacey
I'll massage and crack your back
The roughneck chicken needs a roughneck chickadee
The question of the day, is you down with me?

Time ticks, just me and you on the miss
Grant your every wish
Be your favorite dish, plus dessert
Doesn't matter what time when I do work
Perform like a one man concert

Here's the plan pop in a tape of Uncle Sam
Then I'll show you how nice I am
'Bout to make your mate insanely jealous
And if he don't like it, he got to find us to tell us

Are you down? Can you feel it?
I need to know now what you feel
I got love girl, can you feel it?
And no need to hide if it's real

Are you down? Can you feel it?
I need to know now what you feel
I got love girl, can you feel it?
And no need to hide if it's real

Are you down?
I need to know now
I got love girl
And no need to hide if it's real

Are you down?
I need to know now
I got love girl
