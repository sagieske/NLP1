Song:

All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love there ain't no in-between
Why begin and cry for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

Please don't put your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
So you see I've got to say no
All or nothing at all
