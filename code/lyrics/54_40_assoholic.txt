Song:

Half human monster reveals itself like the car
of your dreams becomes the crash of your
life in the hills of shame dealers play the
blame game the winner is a chronic assoholic
do I know you? Who's deciding now
or never the animals'
agenda sonic defender
three blue suits argue
the button to push you
The best laid plans distorted
by the deaf-like
assoholic do I know you?
You wanna play me
backwards a bad idea whose time is now
assoholic
