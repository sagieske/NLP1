Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
(Vengaboyz are back in town)
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh
Whoa oh whoa oh

If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby
Take my hand
I'll be your lover tonight

Whoa oh whoa oh
This is what I wanna do
Whoa oh whoa oh
(Let's have some fun)
Whoa oh whoa oh
One on one just me and you
Whoa oh whoa oh

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room

Whoa oh whoa oh
(Everybody get on down)
Whoa oh whoa oh
(Vengaboys are back in town)

Whoa oh whoa oh
This is what I wanna do
Whoa oh whoa oh
Let's have some fun
Whoa oh whoa oh
One on one just me and you
Whoa oh whoa oh

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room

Woooo!
Woooo woooo!
Woooo!
Woooo woooo!
Woooo!
Woooo woooo!

Whoa oh whoa oh
Woooo woooo!
Whoa oh whoa oh
Woooo woooo!
Whoa oh whoa oh
Woooo woooo!
Whoa oh whoa oh

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room

Boom boom boom boom
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom
I wanna double boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room
