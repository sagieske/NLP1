Song:

Somebody's need 2 talk 2 her
She's anew kid in this town
And doesn't how 2 be aware
Or how 2 take the care of herself

When she's just arrived
The word that she had came
I assume has spread (2 everywhere)
Even 2 the Monsters in the forrest
(And beyond the lake)

Somebody's need 2 talk with her
Warn by this treath and whisp in her ear
That things in here
Cannot be the same
When now she has came
And all the hope has lost

But we can still win
If you do believe in this
That there's a way
For you 2 survive
Trough this Hell

Somebody's need 2 talk 2 her
She's anew kid in this town
And doesn't how 2 be aware
Or how 2 take the care of herself

But we can still win
By only if she can
Escape (Escape)

(All for the King. I would love it if the rest of us who haves this
Unreleased stuff in pocket, would kindly release them without any bigger
Dreams to became a star. All for the Michael! )

Thank you!
