Song:

What I've done what I've seen
The lives I've touched, what does it mean?
Losing track of everything
I gave it all but what did I gain
And I don't care what waits for me
On the other side of life's release
Cause when I close my eyes your face is all I see
So even if I die I'll never rest in peace

I was desperate just to shine
Now I struggle constantly to survive

I, I have nothing to prove to you

What I've done what I've seen
The lives I've touched, what does it mean?
Losing track of everything
I gave it all but what did I gain
And I don't care what waits for me
On the other side of life's release
Cause when I close my eyes your face is all I see
So even if I die I'll never rest in peace

And I tried so many times
To show that what I feel is real
No this is not a joke, but you keep pushing me
Yeah you keep pushing me
[?]

All I know is lost, I'm alone in this
Silently I watch hoping you'd come back to me
All I know is lost, I'm alone in this
Silently I watch hoping you'd come back to me

Seems like I'll be [?] til the end
Knowing that I kept
Spitting in my [?]

I don't need your empty words or bullshit sympathy
So here's a gift for all those years of mocking me

Now I will shove this evil upon you
You deserve to feel what I'm going through
Now I will shove this evil upon you
You deserve to feel what I'm going through
