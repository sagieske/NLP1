Song:

See how the rhythm of the past
was growing like A child
see how our livingґS running fast
and how the things went wild

Born to dance into the fire
in A groove full of fun
with our hands
high an higher
the heat - driving on
with no chance for our desire
this crazy world turns on
faster and faster - like A rhythm on the run

ItґS getting faster
oh - oh, na na na na na
faster
oh - oh, na na na na na
faster
oh - oh, na na na na na
faster and faster - like A rhythm on the run

See how that sign on the wall
is growing with the race
see how that blue shining ball
is falling out of space

Born to dance into the fire
and to move around the sun
with our hands high and higher
the heat - driving on
born to dance A disaster
this crazy world turns on
faster and faster - like A rhythm on the run

ItґS getting faster...

Born to dance...
