Song:

Join us now with all your wrath
Help destroy men of the cloth
Plaster gods that mean nothing
We must change everything

They must all be destroyed
All of their life devoid
They must be laid to rest
For Christ the final test

Annihilate the brethren of Christ, butcher them, have fun
Smash their skull and maim them, rip them 'til we've won
Destroy the plaster images of the so-called holy son
Burn their buildings to the ground, the killing has begun

Dismember
Mutilate
Slaughter
And kill

Massacre of the priests
They just try to deceive us
Massacre of the priests
Kill the Christ believers

Attack, destroy and desecrate, it's what they all deserve
Bring them to their knees and pray to the one we serve
Once allegiance has been vowed, their mutilated heads
Shall be hung for all to see and warn the holy undead

Dismember
Mutilate
Slaughter
And kill

Massacre of the priests
They just try to deceive us
Massacre of the priests
Kill the Christ believers

The priests are dead!
