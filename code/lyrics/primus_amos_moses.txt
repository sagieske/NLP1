Song:

Yeah, here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun, he lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligator for a living
He used to knock 'em in the head with a stump
Louisiana law's gonna get you, Amos
It ain't legal hunting alligator down in the swamp, boy
Now everybody blamed his old man for makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy, his daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
The alligator man in the Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
They called him Amos Moses

Now folks around South Louisiana said Amos was a helluva man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
He only had to use one hand
That's all he got left 'cause the alligator bit him
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow
Now the Sheriff got wind of Amos was in the swamp trapping alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, "I'm gonna get you boy", but he never come out again
Well, I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to
You sure can get lost in the Louisiana bayou
About 45 minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
Well they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
Named him after a man of the cloth
They called him Amos Moses
Sit down on 'em Amos, make it count son
Get on boy
Here comes Amos
Yeah, you get on him boy, use your wit
