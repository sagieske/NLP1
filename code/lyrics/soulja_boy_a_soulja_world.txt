Song:

Yeah, you know who it is n***a
The motherfucking king
I go so hard on this s**t man, swear to god
Young n***a, sodmg n***a, root of all
Y'already know what it is, hey

God damn another park off, by the pool off
With the top off, n****s talking s**t, got locked up
But god damn, I go off
Little dre, I'ma straight bull, I'm off the chain like a pitbull
I'm pulling up like rata tata,
F**k n***a, you don't want ammo
Free my n****s L and... That's in the summer
South side that Atlanta and south side that New York
I smoke on them swisher sweets like new s***s is New Ports
I'm pulling on on 24, and murder time I'm busting at you
And 23 go bad man, that callie, you flat line

[Hook:] x 2
Welcome into a Soulja world, all young gangstas here
In my hood I was taught to show no fear
Loyalty and respect that's all I know
And I swear to god me and my n****s gonna blow

And when we sitting eating dinner and eating steak
I just want you n***a to know
I'm here to f*****g stay
And I'ma keep it g to my n****s from the start
And I put that on my sickness from my f*****g heart

That n***a don't want gunplay
I set them off on Monday
It's gonna go like one way
And that s**t is my way
I said I'm up on riley,
Heard you n****s talking bout my way
I f**k around and go hard
It's soulja telling I go off
N***a don't wanna try wild
I pull up with a drive by
5 guns at a bad winter,
You see a n***a head still spinning
Still shooting and still popping
And body dropping it's homicide
It's mac 11 that's all we living
I ain't let s**t slide
P***y n***a, you a f**k n***a
And you know you a b***h
Then that's why I never said your name on my songs yeah
I'ma represent for the whole snake
N****s they suckers we taking on
It's soulja soulja, it's also, also
I swear to god, all the coast knows us, b***h!
