Song:

Got the news today
Doctor said I had to stay
A little bit longer
And I'll be fine
When I thought it'd all been done
When I thought it'd all been said
A little bit longer
And I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got
'Till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like
To feel so low
Every time you smile or laugh you glow
You don't even know
No no
You don't even know

All this time goes by
Still no reason why
A little bit longer
And I'll be fine
Waitin' on a cure
But none of them are sure
A little bit longer
And I'll be fine

But you don't know what you got
'Till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like
To feel so low
And every time you smile or laugh you glow
You don't even know
No no
You don't even know
No no
You don't even know
No no

Two, three, four!

Yeah!
And you don't know what you got
'Till it's gone
And you don't know what it's like
To feel so low
And every time you smile or laugh you glow
You don't even know
No
Yeah
Woah!

[Oooohhh]

So I wait 'till kingdom come
All the highs and lows are gone
A little bit longer
And I'll be fine
I'll be
Fine

[Additional lyrics]

So I'm finally here today
You've touched me here today
And I wish that I could stay
A little bit longer
And I will be fine
