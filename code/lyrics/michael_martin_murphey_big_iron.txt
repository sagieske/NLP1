Song:

To the town of Agua Fria, rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among 'em had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the mornin' when he rode into town
He came ridin' from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw, loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"He's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip"

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin', made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came there to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
Said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red, after Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The mornin' past so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows, every body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have gone on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
