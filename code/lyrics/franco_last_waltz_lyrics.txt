Song:

Will you hear my ailing words
Will you be my everything
Swimming in reverie
I'm dreaming until

And it's clear, as clear as over
To me you're just a fairytale
When the waltz is over and the lovers die
You could be a lifesaver

Count to three you're stuck in me forever
Playing houses in boxes of memories
Counting starlight that pass us tonight

And it's clear, as clear as over
To me you're just a fairytale
When the waltz is over and the lovers die
You could be a lifesaver

Couldn't erase the love we had
Couldn't escape the songs we sang
Couldn't we make a space for us
And decide that space for us will burn

Don't say goodbye
Will you be always with me
I want to know the truth
Could you hear me
I'm dreaming until

And it's clear, as clear as over
To me you're just a fairytale
When the waltz is over and the lovers die
You could be a lifesaver
