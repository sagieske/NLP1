Song:

Listen, I can hear a voice,
I need a helping hand,
Just to beat the void.
I need a mission,
A dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken,
And my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the peices
To scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears
You can hear the wind come in

But you change the world with a
Sond and you can't make it right when it's
Wrong

I can't stop this music travelling round with
Me wherever I go, it's playing for you.
I can't stop this voice unravelling round
Me whatever I do. It's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of it's own
Heart beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me - believe me.

Don't let it slip, through your fingertips.
When there's a ghost,
Don't try to reason with it
Because now I'm tired, I'm weird,
So I won't miss a think.
I rope my words out to dry
And I've forgotted what to sing
But you can't change the world
With a song and you can't make it right
When it's wrong

If that's what it was to you,
Then that's what it was to me.
