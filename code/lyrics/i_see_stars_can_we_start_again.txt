Song:

Can we start again
Go back to what it meant back then
Open minds and open hearts
The things that set us apart

Can we start again
Go back to what it meant back then
Open minds and open hearts
The things that set us apart

Was it more than words
And do they still apply
And do you still believe
Well so do I

Was it more than words
And do they still apply
And do you still believe
Well so do I

I was a 15 year old kid
With nowhere to fit in
When someone told me about a place
Where the strange were accepted
And judged by what's inside
A scene of truly open minds
Somewhere, somehow everything has changed
Look at what we've gotten ourselves caught up in
Let's take a look at ourselves

Can we start again
Go back to what it meant back then
Open minds and open hearts
The things that set us apart

Can we start again
Go back to what it meant back then
Open minds and open hearts
The things that set us apart

The same mindless clicks
The same high school s**t
All the walls you scream about breaking down
I've watched you build brick by brick

The same mindless clicks
The same high school s**t
All the walls you scream about breaking down
I've watched you build brick by brick

Can we start again
Go back to what it meant back then
Open minds and open hearts
The things that set us apart

Was it more than words
And do they still apply
And do you still believe
Well so do I
So do I

Was it more than words
And do they still apply
And do you still believe
Well so do I
So do I

Was it more than words
Can we start again
And do they still apply
Go back to what it meant back then
And do you still believe
Do you still believe
Well so do I
So do I
