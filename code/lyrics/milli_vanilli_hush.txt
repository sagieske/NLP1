Song:

Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa

I got a certain little girl, she's on my mind
No doubt about it, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I ever had
Sometimes she's gonna make me feel so bad

Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa

Hush hush - I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush - She broke my heart but I love her just the
Same now
Hush hush - I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush - I need your love and I'm not to blame now

Love love - They got it early in the morning
Love love - They got it late in the evening
Love love - Well I want that needing
Love love - Oh I gotta get ahead of it

She's got a love like quicksand

Only took one touch of her hand
Blow my mind and I'm in so deep
That I can't eat and I can't sleep

Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa

Listen... 

Hush hush - I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush - She broke my heart but I love her just the
Same now
Hush hush - Thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush hush - I need that love and I'm not to blame now

Love love - They got it early in the morning
Love love - They got it late in the evening
Love love - Ooh I want that needing
Love love - Hey I gotta get ahead of it

Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
Naa na na naa na na naa na na naa
