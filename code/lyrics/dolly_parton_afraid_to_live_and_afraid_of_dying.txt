Song:

They say most anything you eat could hurt your health
Be careful what you drink, don't harm yourself
And pollution in the air might make you sick
Makes you afraid to live, afraid that you might die too quick
Do the men that quote this danger really know
Life is gift to be enjoyed and not to worry so
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go

We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'
And afraid to love the one we love, afraid they might be lyin'
We can't enjoy life when they say each thing might bring an early grave
We're afraid to live 'cause we're afraid of dyin'

Do the men that quote this danger really know?
Life is gift to be enjoyed, why worry so?
The biggest danger sign that we should know
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
Make sure we're right with God, as through this world we go
