Song:

Never seen it so dark
Where have you gone?
Am I walking all alone?
I remember all the good times we had together
And I wonder where I went wrong
I need to feel your touch
I need you here so much
I look everywhere but I cannot find
I need to have you here
Without your love I'll lose my mind
Is it a crime?
To feel the way I feel
Is it a crime?
When I know it's so real
People have forgotten me
But that doesn't matter much
Because you're all I need
But now I can't find you
I want to remind you that your love is everything to me
I look to talk to you
But the words just won't come out
If I push real hard they come right back at me
Alone in my room they bounce right off the walls
