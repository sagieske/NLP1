Song:

Sittin' by the open fireplace
In my favorite dungarees
Played a few bars of a melody
And it sounded sweer to me

I thought I'd get up
And take a look around
But my feet got in the way
Stumbled to the floor
She was right in the door

I could see her face
But how could it be
She ran away from me

My best friend's gone
I'm so all alone
I kinda miss you, Brandy
I'm so all alone
When are you comin' back home

I really miss you, Brandy
Missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?
'Cause I love you, Brandy
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sippin' on a cherry soda pop
Building houses made of sand
Like a little child with a fantasy
Just a fraction of a man

But I was in love
When they put her down
My toe stepped in the rain
I could feel the love
Comin' to my heart
Through my windown pane

But how could I know
She would just up and go
My best friend's gone
I'm so all alone

I really miss you, Brandy
I'm so all alone
When are you comin' back home

I really miss you, Brandy
Missing you everyday
Are you coming home to stay?

I kinda miss you, Brandy
When are you comin' back home
I'm so all alone

I really miss you, Brandy
Missing you everyday
Are you comin' home to stay

Oh, I really miss you, Brandy
I'm so all alone
When are comin' back home

Oh, I really miss you
