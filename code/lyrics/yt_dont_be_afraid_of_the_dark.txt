Song:

In the dark there ain't no distractions
Take it off the mask won't let you see
Ain't lettin' up till you unleash all your emotions
I'll be here waiting got love, if you want it
Aw, we'll take it as it comes

Touch by touch, little by little
I'll unchain your heart don't be afraid of the dark
Take my hand, little by little
We'll break down these walls don't be afraid of the dark
No, don't be afraid of the dark

In the light, you hide what you're feeling
In your eyes, you wanna let me know
Rise above and old wounds will start healing
I'll be here waiting got love, if you want it
We'll take it as it comes

Touch by touch, little by little
I'll unchain your heart don't be afraid of the dark
Take my hand, little by little
We'll break down these walls don't be afraid of the dark
No, don't be afraid of the dark

From my hand to your heart
Love is what we make it, ready
We'll feel our way
Don't need words to say

Touch by touch, little by little
I'll unchain your heart don't be afraid of the dark
Take my hand, little by little
We'll break down these walls don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid of the dark, right now
Don't need much to say, from my head to your heart
Touch by touch little by little
