Song:

There's a wren in a willow wood
Flies so high, sings so good
And he brings to you, what he sings to you
And the love in his lullaby
Seems to tell me if I try
I could fly for you
Lover I wanna try for you cause

I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feeling of my home

Summer thunder on moon-bright days
Northern lights in the skys ablaze
I'll bring to you, if you let me sing to you
Silver wings in a firery sky
Show the trail of our love and
I wanna sing to you, love is what i bring to you
I wanna sing to you

Oh, I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feeling of my home

Oh, I wanna sing you a love song
I wanna rock you in my arms all night long
I wanna get to know you
I wanna show you the peaceful feeling of my home
