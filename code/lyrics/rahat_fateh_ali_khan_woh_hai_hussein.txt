Song:

He is hussein
Valiance from Kibriya (Allah)
Pride of Mustafa (The prophet)
He who is Ba khuda (god fearing)
Who is the baqa of religion (carried on the religion)
He is Hussein
Valiance from Kibriya (Allah)
Pride of Mustafa (The prophet)
He who is Ba khuda (god fearing)
Who is the baqa of religion (carried on the religion)
He is Hussein

The shelter of religion
That which the path of truth is
Is the heart of Fatima
Is the son of La fata (the unbeatable Imam Ali)
(Repeat)

The one who Mustafa (Prophet) called his own blood
The one whose will is the same will of Allah
He is hussein

He is drenched in his own blood
The one who is standing in the battlefield
He who is under the blade (while praying), but still has the will of Allah,
He is drenched in his own blood
The one who is standing in the battlefield
He who is under the blade (while praying), but still has the will of Allah,
He who is aligned with what you (Allah) are thinking
On the peak of the nizah (Spear) he recited the Quran
He is Hussein

He who sacrificed all his household in Karbala,
Even took his little Asghar and saved the religion,
He who sacrificed all his household in Karbala,
Even took his little Asghar and saved the religion,
The sky is the witness, witness is also the earth,
He got his head decapitated, so the words of truth be heard,
He is Hussein
Valiance from Kibriya (Allah)
Pride of Mustafa (The prophet)
He who is Ba khuda (god fearing)
Who is the baqa of religion (carried on the religion)
He is Hussein
