Song:

I woke up this morning
Blurry eye
I've been working so hard staying alive
Well, I don't need this s**t
No I won't be long
Before I take that money
Money and run
I'm gonna take that money, money and run

Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind
Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind

I woke up this morning
So destroyed
I've been down in my luck
Just feeling a void
Well, I don't need this s**t
No I won't belong
Before I take that money
Money and run
I'm gonna take that money, money and run

Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind
Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind

Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind
Let's get lost
Drive all night
Leave this whole
F***ed up world behind
