Song:

Well, hello there
Good old friend of mine
You've been reaching for yourself
For such a long time
There's so much to say
No need to explain
Just an open door for you
To come in from the rain
It's a long road
When you're all alone
And someone like you
Will always choose a long way home
There's no right or wrong
I'm not here to blame
I just want to be the one
Who keep you from the rain
From the rain
And it looks like some sunny skies
Now that I know you're alright
Time has left us older
Wiser, I know I am
And it's good to know
My best friend has come home again
'Cause I think of us
Like an old cliche
But it doesn't matter
'Cause I love you anyway
Coming from the rain
And it looks like some disguise
Now that I know you're alright
Time has left us older
But Wiser, I know I am
And it's good to know
My best friend has come home again
'Cause I think of us
Like an old cliche
But it doesn't matter
'Cause I love you anyway
Coming from the rain
Come in from the rain
Come in from the rain
