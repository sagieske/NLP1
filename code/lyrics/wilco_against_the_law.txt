Song:

It's against the law to walk, and against the law to talk
Against the law to loaf, against the law to work
Against the law to read, against the law to write
Against the law to be a black, a brown, or white

Everything's against the law
I'm a low-pay daddy singing the high-price blues

It's against the law to eat, against the law to drink
Against the law to worry, against the law to think
Against the law to marry or try to settle down
Against the law to ramble like a bum from town to town

Everything's against the law
I'm a low-pay daddy singing the high-price blues

It's against the law to come, against the law to go
Against the law to ride, against the law to roll
Against the law to hug and against the law to kiss
Against the law to shoot, against the law to miss

Everything's against the law
I'm a low-pay daddy singing the high-price blues

It's against the law to gamble, against the law to roam
Against the law to organize or try to build a home
Against the law to sing, it's against the law to dance
Against the law to tell you all the trouble on my hands

Everything in Winston-Salem is against the law
I'm a low-pay daddy singing the high-price blues
