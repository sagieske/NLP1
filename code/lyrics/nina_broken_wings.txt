Song:

I'm feeling like a butterfly with broken wings, 
Fluttering.
Dreaming of flying away, 
Being scared to fall.

Oh I am hiding for an eager breeze.
That will drag me to the vicious truth.
It will screech into my heart.

But I can't hide forever, 
No I got to face the truth.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst, 
It's more the feeling I can't hide, where I cover myself in.
The grief of being different lets me flown away in tears.

Hear the sob, yeah that was mine, wincing. 
By the thought of laying me down, the switch of the ignorance.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst, 
It's more the feeling I can't hide, where I cover myself in.
The grief of being different let me flown away in tears.

I wander in the streets and looking doubtful at myself, 
Suddenly the sadness is hard to fade away
Because I realize I am different, but I'm the same inside my mind.

I got scarves on the outside, believe they're now the worst.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst, 
It's more the feeling I couldn't hide, where I covered myself in.
I realized I am different.

I got scarves on the outside, but they are not the worst, 
It's more the feeling I couldn't hide, where I covered myself in.
I realized I am different.

But I'm the same inside my mind, 
I'm the same inside my mind.
