Song:

Sweet memories of you
Funny things that we used to do
I guess I was too young to see
How much you really meant to me

And then I knew in you
a trust so true
I found a friend in you
A friend that is so true

With you I had the time
Time of my life
Time of my life with you
In you I found a friend
Love to the end
Joy from a friend in you
