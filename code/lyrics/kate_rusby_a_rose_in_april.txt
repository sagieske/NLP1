Song:

Oh can I go to my love's side
Oh let me go this day,
Please let me go to my love's side,
Oh mother, don't make me stay.
I was a rose in April
And still a rose in June
I fear that come the winter,
I shall no longer bloom

Oh daughter, daughter you cannot go,
Oh you cannot go this day.
Your father, he forbade you,
And at home you must remain.
You were a rose in April,
And still a rose in June,
But God can send five winters
And I know my rose will bloom

Mother, mother, I must away
Unto my true love's side.
Bring to me my white horse,
And away to him I'll ride
She's rode through fields of barley,
And she's rode throught fields of corn,
She's come unto her true love
One hour before the dawn.

Her father, being awakened,
Heard of his daughter's flight.
He's taken up his dagger
And he's rode into the night.
He's rode through fields of barley
And he's sped through fields of corn.
He's come unto her true love's house
Just before the dawn.

He's found his daughter sleeping
In her true lover's arms.
He's taken up his dagger
And it's deep into their hearts.
Oh father, cruel father,
You've killed my love, killed me,
But now I'll rest beside him,
Locked in his arms I'll be.
Locked in his arms I'll be
