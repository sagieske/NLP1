Song:

I call you my friend and that's all that I knew.
Why do I have to pretend to find ways to be around you?
You've been there all along.
Holding my hand like you do.
Why do I feel that it's wrong to love to be around you?

And I think I'm losing my mind.
Might be.
I am hoplessly blind to your beauty.
And you have a sweet sinful smile.
I'm in trouble.
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around.

Do I feel what I feel?
Well do you feel this way too?
That every wound seems to heal
When I am around you.
Why?

And I must be losing my mind.
Maybe.
I have been hoplessly blind to your beauty.
And you have a sweet sinful smile.
I'm in trouble.
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around.
And around

And I must be I'm losing my mind.
Maybe.
You have a sweet sinful smile.
I'm in trouble.
Cause you turn me upside down and around and around.
Turn me upside down and around and around.
Turn me upside down and around and around.
My feet don't touch the ground when I'm around you
When I'm around you you you you you.
