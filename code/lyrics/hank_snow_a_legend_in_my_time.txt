Song:

If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statues for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time.

But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time.

(But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fame)
For a heart that's been broken over love that's in vain
(If loneliness meant world acclaim then everyone would know my name)
I'd be a legend in my time...
