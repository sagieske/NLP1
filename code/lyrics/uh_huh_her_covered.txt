Song:

Would I fall under that spell again
I don't think so anymore
But I don't know what's written
I'll be there anyway
Call it love I guess, hotter than the sun
You can appreciate it

Oh say hey what you know
I don't know how to let it go
Say hey what you know
Wish you knew what I was thinking
Hey watch me now
I know how to level you, hey
What you gonna say? What you gonna say?

Hollar now you want it
Gonna see, see how do you love again?
Higher than the stars
You're covered in my hands tonight
(Oh baby)
Hollar now you want it
Gonna see, see how do you love again?
Covered by the dark, no light
You're covered in my hands tonight

Oh, see all the things that surround you are full of love
Brighter than the stars
So why all those cold dark hours?

Oh say hey what you know
I don't know how to let it go
Hold on to what you're told
But I don't know what you've been thinking
Hey what'd you know
Guess I don't know anything,
Won't see you again my love
You say forever, can't touch it
It's harder than hell cause I want to

Hollar now you want it
Gonna see, see how do you love again?
Higher than the stars
You're covered in my hands tonight
(Oh baby)
Hollar now you want it
Gonna see, see how do you love again?
Covered by the dark, no light
You're covered in my hands tonight (oh baby)

Hollar now you want it
Gonna see, see how do you love again?
Covered by the dark, no light
But you're covered in my hands tonight (oh baby)
