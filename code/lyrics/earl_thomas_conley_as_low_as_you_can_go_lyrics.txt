Song:

(1st verse spoken)
I came home early this morning
And she was gone
So I turned to the mirror
But the mirror seemed to say

Down in the valley
Across the city
Through the dark alleys
Filled with self-pity
Where people are victims of their own fears

Have you come down to the devil's table
Drinking poison, 'til you're not able
To see how your laughter has turned to tears

Boy you're as low as you can go
Left more than tracks along the road
Among the seeds that you have sown
There lies a man you should have known

Boy you're as low as you can go
Left more than tracks along the road
Among the seeds that you have sown
There lies a man you should have known

Boy you're as low as you can go
Left more than tracks along the road
Among the seeds that you have sown
There lies a man you should have known
