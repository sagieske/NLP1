Song:

Friday night and the moon is high,
I'm wide awake just watchin' you sleep
And I promise you you're gonna have,
More than just the things that you need
We ain't got much now, we're just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming.

Chorus :
Someday baby,
You and I are gonna be the ones, good luck's gonna shine
Someday baby,
You and I are gonna be the ones, so hold on, we're headed for a better life.

Oh now there's a place for you and me,
Where we can dream as big as the sky.
I know it's hard to see it now,
But baby someday we're gonna fly,
This road we're on, you know it might be long,
But my faith is strong, it's all that really matters.

Repeat Chorus:

So hold on, hold on, c'mon baby, hold on,
Yeah we're gonna have it all, and ooh

Repeat chorus twice :

A better life now, oh ho, a better life
Hey we're gonna leave this all behind us baby, wait and see.
We're headed for a better life, you and me.
We're gonna break the chains that bind and, finally we'll be free.
We're gonna be the ones that have it all, you and me.
Just hold on tight now baby, woooh
