Song:

Amazi-ing Grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a-a wretch like me
I o-once wa-as lost but now-ow I-I'm found
Was blind, but now, I see
T'was Grace tha-at taught my heart to fear
And Grace, my-y fears relieved
How pre-ecious did that Gra-ace a-appear

Through many-y dangers, toils and snares
I have a-already come
T'is Gra-ace tha-at brought me sa-afe thu-us far
And Grace wi-ill lead me home
When we've bee-een there ten thousand years
