Song:

Maker of the land
Maker of the song
Maker of the constitution

The journey of the great one
Starts from the east
Were the mighty ocean meets the land
Then the population came
She walked with the law in her hands
Singing children of the earth
Praise the journey of the song lines
Find the sign and follow the sun

Maker of the land
Maker of the song
Maker of the constitution...

Like the Southern Cross above
Beam your light
For your destiny
From the Great Dividing Ranges
To the desert to the city streets
What's that on the shoreline?
Where the Goannas roam
Show the tracks of your tears
Free your mind
Like a bird on the wind

Maker of the land
Maker of the song
Maker of the constitution...

Lightning she spoke
The power of one
Into the sea
Where the splinters fell
Her mind at it's best
She did create
Baywara Baywara

Maker of the land
Maker of the song
Maker of the constitution
