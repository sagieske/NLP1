Song:

Trains don't cry
And bullets don't sing
A broken heart ain't worth anything
Even a bird of prey lets out some kind of scream
I would have never done to you what you done to me
Fifty odd dollars and some dry alcohol
Stand on the stairway, against the wall
Even a preacher, Lord, sometimes he just can't believe
I would have never done to you what you done to me
Lies on your table
Lies in your eyes
Lies in your face
Lies in your smile
Trains only leave
And bullets just scream
I would have never done to you what you done to me
I would have never done to you whaty ou done to me
I would have never done to you what you done to me
