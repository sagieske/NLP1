Song:

So together we can breathe, 
I wanna give you all I need, 
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me
When I'm falling to my knees
I wanna give you all I need
You know how to take care of me, of me, of me
Together we can breathe, 
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe, 
Love me, love me
Addicted to the colours that you're using on me
Clouds above my head are beautiful and red, blow it up
It's crystal clear when things are blur
When you still hold me in your world, blow it up
