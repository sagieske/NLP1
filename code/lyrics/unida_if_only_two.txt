Song:

Your eyes both look just the same
Surprised just because of the blame
Tell me true that they are insane
Star in your head, back in your lane

If only...

Lonely, you own me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If only...
Lonely, you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're 2, 000 miles away
You're looking back, nothing to say
Tell me true that they are insane
You're 2, 000 miles away

If only...
Lonely. You know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If only...
Lonely. You own me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If only
Lonely... Only... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

If only
Lonely. You know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If only
Lonely. You know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If only
Lonely. You own me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
