Song:

I wish that we could do it over again
Every smile, every tear, every part
'Cause I know that nothing ever will end if it's safe inside our hearts
So let's move on but never let go
As we take these steps on our own
Whatever will be, I'll remember you so remember me
Remember me
And I'll, be there
(And I'll be there)
Remember me
When you feel lost, somewhere
(Somewhere)
And I know with just one magic touch
It can all reappear
When ever you need
A good memory
Remember me

Looking at everyone now
I know how hard it will be to move on
But I swear somewhere out there we'll find where we belong
And I know it won't be easy but in my heart I'll carry you with me
What every you do Remember me and I'll Remember you

Remember me
And I'll, be there
(And I'll be there)
Remember me
When you feel lost, somewhere
(Somewhere)
And I know with just one magic touch
It can all reappear
When ever you need
A good memory
Remember me

So many new days up ahead
And I'm excited to see all of them
But please don't forget about this time
Just close your eyes and

Remember me
And I'll, be there
(And I'll be there)
Remember me
When you feel lost, somewhere
(Somewhere)
And I know with just one magic touch
It can all reappear
When ever you need
A good memory
Remember me
