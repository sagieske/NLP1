Song:

From the time time began You
Always chose a man
To lead the people safely by Your
Way
To be a voice and echo what You
Say
Like David or Abraham
Your Word is full of such men
And if the Bible had no closing
Page
And still was being written to
This day
Chorus
I want to be a man that you
Would write about
Oh a thousand years from now
That they could read about
Your servant of choice in whom
You found favor
A man who heard Your voice
Generations away it is my prayer
That they will look back and say
Oh to have that kind of faith
And love
What a solid man of God he was
