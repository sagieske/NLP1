Song:

I can't imagine me without you
Or one and one could never be two
Can't imagine me without you
Wow, wow

I can imagine there are no countries
Now I know what you're thinking
Can you imagine what I'm feeling
This feeling of love I feel

I can imagine there is no sky
Now don't go thinking
I'm exaggerating
You without me, I can't see

Thinking I'm crazy
Yes, I'm crazy for you

Try so hard to describe
The way I feel
I'm searching for a way
Whenever be that day for me
Or will I still be saying
