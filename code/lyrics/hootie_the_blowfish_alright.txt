Song:

She's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright.
Yes, she's always beside me.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
I'm so confused.
She's not amused.
'cause I do way too much thinking.
It's not supposed to be this hard.
So, she calls me out and there's no doubt that I do way too much drinking.
I guess it's got me through this far.
When my life gets crazy, she can still amaze me.
Sometimes I think, hell, what's the use of going on?
But, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright.
Yes, she's always beside me.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
I heard the news.
I just refuse to believe that we were sinking.
Still can't believe they went that far.
So, I start to shout, but I'm all cried out and still doing way too much thinking.
Can't seem to scrape away those scars. no.
And, if my life gets crazy, she can still amaze me.
Sometimes I think, hell, what's the use of going on?
But, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright.
Yes, she's always beside me.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright. alright.
I think I can finally see what she's been telling me.
It's all inside my head.
I guess I knew it all along.
And, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright.
Yes, she's always beside me.
She keeps reminding me that it's all in me.
But, she's always reminding me that things are gonna be alright.
Yes, she's always beside me.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
She keeps reminding me that everything will be alright.
