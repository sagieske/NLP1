Song:

We will rise when you fall,
Find the strength in yourself
To turn your life around
And rise.
Rise back to the top.
I'm over working,
Over stressing myself,
All this time that I've wasted,
Won't have to be wasted on you.

I've learned to just trust myself.

You can't believe everything you're told,
Find yourself, make a plan and don't just wait around for things to unfold.
Second chances don't come easy and they fade so fast,
Pick up where you left of and bury the past.
Pick up where you left of and bury the past.

I've buried everything and everyone I've ever known.
No turning back now, this all I've ever known.
No turning back now! We're all in this together.
Got to keep control, no room for mistake.

To every m**********are who tried to bring me down,
To every sorry f**k who had no faith in me,
To every fake piece of s**t who said I'd amount to nothing,
You've all helped me succeed in my American Dream!

What! What!

To every m**********are,
To every sorry f**k,
To every fake piece s**t,
I'm f*****g over it!
I'm f*****g over it!

You can't believe everything you're told,
Find yourself, make a plan and don't just wait around for things to unfold.
Second chances don't come easy and they fade so fast,
Pick up where you left of and bury the past.
Pick up where you left of and bury the past.

You can't believe everything you're told,
Don't wait around for things to unfold,
Find yourself, make a plan.
Find yourself!

We've come too far (we've come too far),
To sell ourselves short, sell ourselves short.
And become what they want me to be,
I'll never be what they want me to be.
We've come too far (we've come too far),
To sell ourselves short, sell ourselves short.
And become what you want me to be,
I'll never be what they want me to be.

Step away from the path!
Break away from conformity!
This is my life, this is my time to shine!
This is my life!
F**k who you want me to be!

American Dream!
American Dream!
