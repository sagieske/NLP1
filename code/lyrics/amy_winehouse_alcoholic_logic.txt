Song:

(Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing
Taking you away
My head is spinning)

My girl
Tried to stop me
But I had
A taste of you
Unfamiliar
Surroundings
Left me wanting
Something new
Physical
Ain't even my type
But you're one
Of a kind
So subconsciously
On purpose
I left my coat behind

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

I hate
My alcoholic logic
As I write
This on the train
Victoria's Secret
In my bag
And my thighs
Ache again
Last night tips
Into my mind
Through the puddle
In my head
I always get
What I want
I think I even said

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up
My loose ends
But I left my jacket
With you
And you know my friends
So maybe
You will get my number
Or ask them
When I'm ached down
But I may have
Forgotten you
By the next time
I'm in town

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too
