Song:

Meet me after dark
We'll go against the weather
We'll fight, well they can't decide for us
Their minds are cynical
Their ordinary eyes can't see through it all.
They can't see through it all.

Don't be afraid cause I'm here
Meet me halfway, I got you now
I got you now.

Cause when we go just so you know
I'll be right here to carry you
Erase the traces
Restart everything, everything new
With wounds to mend
Hearts break but it can rebuild again.

It's safe to let go I'm right here with you
It's your trust that I need to believe
That I'm not in this thing alone.

Would you run away with me if it's tonight?
Leave everything behind
Come on, come on.
Leave with me.

I got you now.
