Song:

[Chorus]
Hey you
Hey you
You're different from those things that you do
Hey you
Do you
Feel like a million bucks when you're through

When you lose the stitch
In your handkerchief
And give me back like an Indian gift
Well, there I go again
Over and over and over I deserve this guilt
This guilt

Hey you
Hey you
You're different from those things that you do
Hey you
Oh I'm not shadow proof
I'm the skin baggage you've seen right through

When I walk a ditch
For anchorage
And wear out both ends of this candlestick
I'm stampin' my foot
No one's listenin'
And over and over I deserve this

[Instrumental]

Hey you
Hey you
You're different from those things that you do
Hey you
Do you
Feel like a million bucks when you're through
