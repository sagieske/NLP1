Song:

Friday night and my work's all done
I get my baby go and have some fun
We're gonna see a double feature tonight
That gives us lots of time to do it up right

She's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one

Well, I picked my baby up she slid right in
I revved my Chevy up and revved it again
Her daddy's standing out beside the street
I laid some rubber there for him to eat

She's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one

And the show now... 
She reached over and she squeezed on my rocks
I lost it all in the popcorn box
I hollered louder than an Indian scout
And that's when the usher started prowlin' about

Oh oh oh
He started flipping and a-flashin' his light
Right in the middle of the Indian fight
The Redskins were shootin' at the wagon train
That's when me and the Cavalry came

She's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one

Oh you know now... 
She reached over and she squeezed on my rocks
I lost it all in the popcorn box
I hollered louder than an Indian scout
That's when the usher had to throw us out
He threw us

We left the movie and we ran to the car
Lucky for me we didn't have to go far
My baby started movin' sweet and low
She picked it up again right where she let go

She's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one

Oh oh, she reached over and she squeezed on my rocks
I lost it all too soon man
I hollered louder boy it's hard to see
My seat's gettin' sticky but that's alright by me, yeah

I like the way she likes to rattle my bone
I like the way she takes me all the way home
I like the way she likes to shake it around
She's got the saltiest shaker in town

She's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one
Well you she's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one
Oh yeah, she's a co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Co-co-co-co-co-co-co-co
Cool one

My baby she's a cool one
