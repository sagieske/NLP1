Song:

Here I go again acting like I'm the king of the world.
Oh whoa
Don't give a damn about the voice in my head; do you ever learn?
Yeah, I let myself get starry-eyed.

I drink all night
When I'm uptight.
Another round
To make it right.

Waking up again with a heart full of hate
Memory lost in alcohol
Where did my head go, go?
You took a lot of love from this heart full of hate
Babe and I gave you quite a show
Drinks on me, unstoppable

I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
(In a flashback)

Last night, I had another bad dream that wasn't meant to reoccur
And now I know, too much of one thing will only make you feel worse
But my alter ego take the lead

I drink all night
When I'm uptight.
Another round
To make it right.

Waking up again with a heart full of hate
Memory lost in alcohol
Where did my head go, go?
You took a lot of love from this heart full of hate
Babe and I gave you quite a show
Drinks on me, unstoppable

I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
(In a flashback)

Wrapped in twilight, great mistakes
[?] high and low, 
Glorious and pitiful, 
Nights are young and so are we
That is just how we roll

I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback, I'm in a flashback
(In a flashback)

Waking up again with a heart full of hate
Memory lost in alcohol
Where did my head go, go?
You took a lot of love from this heart full of hate
Babe and I gave you quite a show
Drinks on me, unstoppable

I'm in a flashback
