Song:

2000, 2000
112, 112
And we wont stop, 'cause we can't stop. No we wont stop, 'cause we can't stop

I heard you got plenty of money
Plenty of clothes
An escalade a porche
And a house on a hill
A platnium watch
Platnium rinds
Platnium cards
A condo in beverly hills
And they say that your a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'cause I just want for you to see that all I want is you

I heard you got guchi belts to match ya boots
Versache wear, chanel, and fendi suits
Purple light benz, purple light lexus coope
And you make sure ya friendz are bout it to
And you say that your a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'cause I just want you to see that all I want is you

Chorus-
All, I rea-lly want is you
Believe it, 'cause what, I say, is true
Not in-trested in what you do
'cause all I rea-lly want is you

I heard you got
S*** eyes, s*** lips, s*** feet
You got s** appeal
The ay you wear your hair
The way you dress
And girl the way you make me feel
Makes me want you more and more
Your everything I'm lookin for
And I just need for you to see that all I want is you

Baby I love your personality
I think your everything a woman should be
Like picture out of a magizine
Or a vision from my wildest dreams
Makes me want you more and more
Your everything I'm lookin for
And I just need for you to see that all I really want is you

All, I rea-lly want is you
Believe it, 'cause what, I say, is true
Not in-trested in what you do
'cause all I rea-lly want is you
(Repeat x 5)
