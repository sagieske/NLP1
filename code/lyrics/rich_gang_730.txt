Song:

He play, I'm legal
I'mma fire
I'mma, I'mma, I'mma spoil a baby
Yeah, spoil
F**k n***a
You might as well be royal
Take all the truth

Everything coming out of your mouth is a fairy tale truth
I'mma have to pull out these 2
Now the size of my pocket ain't sizing my shoes
Damn!

We all got grills
Why so harsh?
I got a wife close by
I got lawyer and I don't know you
It's your son
Need cover
I train soldiers
730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730

Do not get disturbed
I go 730 even if you're nerdy
Shiny look b*****s
A shiny look n***a
I don't mind to let it on
B*****s and ni***z don't call me
No point
And I know what to do with you
I do not care if you starve for a dollar

730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730, 730

All them in prison they go at 730
All them presidents go at 730
All the rich gang are going at 730
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
I got at 730
P***y n***a
