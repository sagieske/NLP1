Song:

You're dead! 
You're dead! 

Your body's cold, 
Hope is lost, I can't let go, 
Can I die with you, 
So we can never grow old?

Cut the ties (Cut the ties)
With this note you left behind
As I read the words I hear you telling me why

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone, 
To a place where you belong

My sadness shows, 
As your name is carved in stone
Can't erase the words so the reality grows

I wish I died (I wish I died)
On that night right by your side
So just kill me now and let the good times roll

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong

Will you wait for me? (Will you wait for me?)
Will I see you on the other side?
You won't have to wait too long
Ye-yeh-eh-yeah

Will you come to me? (Will you come to me?)
Will you take me to the other side?
'Cause here I don't belong

Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you're finally go
To a place where you belong

I never said goodbye
Can't even ask you why
I'm wasting! 
Away in my on misery
I hope you've finally gone
To a place where you belong!
