Song:

And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

[Beat break]

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power power power

They call will-A
Stay so cool, I’m chilli
I done made that maley
On my way to that valet
Used to have a ticket thing, but now I got that bigger bank
Who who cares what the haters state
They hate on me cause we doing what they can't

I stay on that hussle, I flex that loose to muscle
Hate to bust your bubble
I'm on that other level
Imma take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire

And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

[Beat break]

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power power power

Yes yes yes y’all feeling funky fresh yall
Work to be the best yall
We’re good under pressure yall
Been through all that stress y’all
Get this off my chest yall
Made it out in project where this project that's progress yall

I beat it through my mama
I told her what I was on it
That imma be that number
One day I'll be that number 1
I take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay and buy attire
Keeping burning like that fire

Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
So imma get stronger
Call me like a veteran, bateram
I lock lock it down and go again
Call me like a veteran, bateram
I lock lock it down and go again

And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And oh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive
And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

[Beat break]

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power
Power power power

And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

[Beat break]
