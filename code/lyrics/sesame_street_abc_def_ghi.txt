Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
It's the most remarkable word I've ever seen
Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
I wish I knew exactly what I mean
It starts out like an "A" word as anyone can see
But somewhere in the middle it gets awful "QR" to me
Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
If I ever find out just what this word can mean
I'll be the smartest bird the world has ever seen!

It might be kind of an elephant
Or a funny kind of kazoo
Or strange, exotic turtle
You never see in a zoo
Or maybe a kind of a doggie
Or particular shade of blue
Or maybe a pretty flower
Naah, not with a name like that, Uh uh!

Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
It's the most remarkable word I've ever seen
Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
I wish I knew exactly what I mean
It starts out like an "A" word as anyone can see
But somewhere in the middle it gets awful "QR" to me
Abc-Def-Ghi-Jkl-Mnop-Qrstuv-Wxyz
If I ever find out just what this word can mean
I'll be the smartest bird the world has ever seen!
