Song:

[Verse:]
Feel it race
Going numb
Got me beating like a drum
What I say
When I spill
Maybe I should never talk
Na na na na na, ay
Na na na na na, ay
Stories end
People change
But I'm ripping like a page
I don't dream
I'm afraid
Seeing nightmares in the day
Na na na na na, ay
Na na na na na, ay

[Pre-Chorus:]
Say goodnight
I'm still lying awake by your side
& even though I know I shouldn't I'm
Feeding the monsters I'm afraid to fight

[Chorus:]
Leave every bottle
As empty
As my promises
Just like the last time
I swore I'd
Get sober for this
Told you I fought â€˜em
They tempt me
I'm begging to live
Hands on your shoulder
I told ya
I'd get sober for this

[Verse 2:]
Wanna drink
Wanna smoke
Wanna feel it in my throat
Then I sink
Then I choke
And I realize that I don't
Na na na na na, ay
Na na na na na, ay
Unafraid
Feel it rise
Baby you can bet I'm high
Then the pain
Let it ride
I been aching the whole time
Na na na na na, ay
Na na na na na, ay

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus](2x)
