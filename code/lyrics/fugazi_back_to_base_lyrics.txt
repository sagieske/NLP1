Song:

Autonomy is a world of difference
They're creeping round but they know they can't come in
Back from the front with observation it's still there
Across from me an extreme example
Bringing you what they want twenty four hours a day
Whole lot of not but it's convenient pray for fire
They'll tell you anything
It's speculation pure speculation
Bringing you back to base
