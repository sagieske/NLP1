Song:

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself.
This love's too good to last,
And I'm too old to change.

Don't grow up too fast
And don't embrace the past.
This life's too good to last,
And I'm too young to care.

[Interlude:]

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself.
This life could be the last
And you're too young to see.
Woah...
