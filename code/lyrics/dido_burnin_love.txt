Song:

I found no peace
In the lies that I've told,
I'm only hurt by the blows that get withheld
The sharper I get cut
The harder I get held
More that I believe
That you will come to me

Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for
Whao-ao
Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for

I found no peace
In the lies that I've told,
I'm only hurt by the blows that get withheld
The sharper I get cut
The harder I get held
More that I believe
That you will come to me

Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for
Whao-ao
Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for

'Out you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for

Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for
Whao-ao
Without you I've been burnin' love
Whao-ao
You're the one that I've been calling for
