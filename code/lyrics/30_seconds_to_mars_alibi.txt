Song:

No warning sign, No Alibi
Were fading faster than the speed of light.
Took our chance, crashed and burned.
No, we'll never ever learn.

I fell apart, but I got back up again,
And then I fell apart, but got back up again,
Yeah.

We both could see crystal clear,
That the inevitable end was near.
Made our choice, trial by fire,
To battle is the only way we feel alive.

I fell apart, but got back up again,
And then I fell apart, but got back up again,
And then I fell apart, but got back up again.
Way-o (x6)

So here we are, witching hour,
The quickest turn to divide and devour.
Divide and devour.
If I could end the quest for fire,
For truth, for love, for my desire.

And I fell apart, but got back up again.
Way-o (x9)

I fell apart, I fell apart, I fell apart,
I fell apart. I fell apart,
But got back up again.
