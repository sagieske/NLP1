Song:

(J. C. Fogerty)

Ev'ry day I'm gonna strut that stuff.
When the music's loud I can't get enough.
Singin' hi, singin' hi,
Come on feet, Teach yourself to move.

People shuff'lin' up and down again.
Unhappy faces ain't gonna get you in.
Singin' hi, singin' hi,
Come on people, Teach yourself to move.

Hey, hey! Hey, all right!

Spread the news, we're goin' have some fun.
Let it go, movin' son-of-a-gun.
Singin' hi, signin' hi,
Come on feet, We was Born To Move.

Hey, hey, Lord! Come on, move it, now boy!
