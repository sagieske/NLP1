Song:

You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

You broke my heart
When you said we're part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Boogie, babe!

Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?
Look out!

Farewell, goodbye, although I 'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

Boggie, babe!

Ain't that a shame?
Ain't that a shame?

You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
