Song:

As things break down, you were there to
Mend this broken heart.
Our lives might fall, but you'll find a way to
Save it all.

Refrain:
You have your way of talking with other
Angels of the world.
And I can say, you were made to make me
See.

Chorus:
'Cause you believe in me,
You believe in everything I do.
You believe in me,
You believe in every time I say I do.

As time unfolds, you'll make it sure I'll
Dodge and wouldn't crawl.
I can say your touch can weaken me, can
Make me believe that

Repeat Refrain
Repeat Chorus

Bridge
I won't run, I won't hide, I will try,
I will fight 'cause I've got you by my side
And I can say you were made to make me see

'Cause you believe in me,
You believe in everything I do.
You believe in me,
You believe in everything I do

Repeat Chorus

I do (9x)
