Song:

Search and you'll define the sky between the lines
I could never tell truth from victim escapes a tired line
Knock knock, something's creeping
Laying down the land smear on the wicked
Now if you're ready to bleed
Turn your head, turn your head, from the right, follow me
Give chase to my shadows disarmed with a whisper
No gun in my hand whatever happened to honor brother
Fight me man-to-man, look me in the eye, I've got a family to feed
Will I learn from this, what can this teach me?
It's out of control, the times are crazy
We don't care who sits on throne, doesn't matter to most of us
Just don't mess with status quo
Lies paint my picture everyday
Every stone's been thrown
Lay siege to my kingdom, my cover's blown
Your blind dealing with death
Every dollar, a headstone
Where the rich get richer, the poor just multiply
That's smart, divide and conquer
I keep 'em entertained while you steal their hard earned moola
Was there ever a time we dreamed for something better?
Right now sounds real good but you're telling me to wait for fairer weather

Let it rain, fire from the sky
Heaven help us (Do you truly believe?)
Only the strong should survive
With permission, I make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire (Save us from the fire)

Yes sir, yes ma'am, I get the picture
We educate the masses whose gonna be cooking our dinners
Such a waste of time, thinking we have to raise our own sons and daughters
When you can pay below the minimum
Shoot that man, may I follow up that order
But all this talk don't come cheap
We all know what has to be done
Our very own personal revolution
Revolution revolution revolution
Revolution revolution
Revolution revolution
Revolution revolution

Let it rain, fire from the sky
Heaven help us (Do you truly believe?)
Only the strong should survive
With permission, I make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire (Save us from the fire)

Now here you come walking into my part of town
Telling people you have such a solution
Quick fix, you got a story, boy meets girl
Stop! They have kids
Poppa works while 'ma raises the ten babies
She's praying every night that they'll one day hit the jackpot
Nine lucky numbers to win the lottery, a million gets me out of this hole
But when the well dries up, oh, where do I go?
Little Pablo doesn't even know how to read or write
I'm starving sweet Ana so I can get a good price for her
2 down 8 to go, oh wait, he's got good skin tone,
Got nice smile, an accent, but kinda smells though
So where do you think you're going talking that kind of talk
That doesn't happen, not on my watch, no, that doesn't happen

I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
Let's give 'em a fighting chance and see where this all goes
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
If I don't do nothing, let's see where this all goes
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
They got front row seats, don't tell me they know
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
They don't need your donation, what about education
I ask you all to bear witness to the rape of these young souls
No amount of praying's gonna change their woes

Let it rain, fire from the sky
Heaven help us (Do you truly believe?)
Only the strong should survive
With permission, I make this my personal mission
Save me from the fire (Save us from the fire)
