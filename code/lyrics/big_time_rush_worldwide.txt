Song:

Ooh
Wait a minute before you tell me anything, how was your day?
Cause I been missing you by my side, yeah
Did I awake you out of your dream
I'm sorry but I couldn't sleep
You calm me down
There's something bout the sound of your voice
I-I-I-I'm never never (never as far away as it may seem)
Soon we'll be together
We'll pick up right where we left off

Paris, London, Tokyo
There's just one thing that I gotta do
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
(Hello, tuck you in every night)
And I can hardly take another goodbye
Baby, won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you) worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you)

Yes, I may meet a million pretty girls that know my name
But don't you worry, cause you have my heart
It ain't easy to keep on moving city to city
Just get up and go
The show must go on so I need you to be strong
I-I-I-I'm never never (never as far away as it may seem)
Soon we'll be together
We'll pick up right where we left off

Paris, London, Tokyo
There's just one thing that I gotta do
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
(Hello, tuck you in every)
And I can hardly take another goodbye
Baby, won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you) worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you)

Oh
Wherever the wind blows me
You're still the one and only girl on my mind (baby)
No, there ain't no one better (worldwide)
So always remember (worldwide)
Always remember, girl you're mine

Paris, London, Tokyo
There's just one thing that I gotta do
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
(Hello, tuck you in every night)
And I can hardly take another goodbye
Baby won't be long
You're the one that I'm waiting on
(Hello, tuck you in every night on the phone)
Girl I'll be thinking about you worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you) worldwide, worldwide, worldwide
(Girl I'll be thinking about you)

(Worldwide)
Yes, I may meet a million pretty girls that know my name
But don't you worry
Cause you have my heart
