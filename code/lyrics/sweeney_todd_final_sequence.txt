Song:

Mrs. Lovett:
(sung)
Toby, where are you, now
(spoken)
Where is he
(sung)
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around

Todd:
(spoken)
Toby. Toby!

Mrs. Lovett:
(sung)
Nothing's gonna harm you, darling
Not while I'm around

Todd:
(spoken)
Toby!

Anthony:
(spoken)
Mr. Todd!
You wait for him here
I'll return with the coach
In less than half an hour
Don't worry
No one will recognize you...
You're safe.

Johanna:
(spoken)
Safe?
So we run away and then all
Our dreams come true?

Anthony:
(spoken)
I hope so...

Johanna:
(spoken)
I've never had dreams. Only
Nightmares.

Anthony:
(spoken)
Johanna... When we're free of this
Place all the ghosts will go away.

Johanna:
(spoken)
No, Anthony, they never go away.

Anthony:
(spoken)
I'll be right back to you... Half an
Hour and we'll be free.

Beggar woman:
(sung)
Beadle... Beadle...
No good hiding, I saw you!
Are you in there still?
Beadle, Beadle...
Beadle dear, Beadle...
Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling,
Beadle, dumpling, Be-deedle dumpling...

Todd:
(spoken)
Who are you? What are you doing here?!

Beggar woman:
(spoken)
Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of
Evil -- from below -- from her! ...
She's the Devil's wife! Oh, beware
Her, sir. She with no pity...
... In her heart...
(sung)
Hey, don't I know you, mister?

Judge:
(spoken)
Mr. Todd. Where is she?

Todd:
(spoken)
Below, your honor,
With my neighbor.
Thank heaven, the sailor
Did not molest her
Thank heaven too,
She has seen the error of her ways

Judge:
(spoken)
She has?

Todd:
(spoken)
Oh yes, your lesson was well done
She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness

Judge:
(spoken)
Then she shall have it!
She'll be here soon sir?

Todd:
(spoken)
Yes

Judge:
(spoken)
Excellent, my friend.

Todd:
(spoken)
How about a shave. Sit, sir, sit.

Judge:
(sung)
Pretty women

Todd:
(sung)
Pretty women, yes

Judge:
(sung)
Johanna, Johanna

Todd:
(sung)
Pretty women, pretty women
Are a wonder
Pretty women

Judge/Todd:
(sung)
What we do for pretty women
(simultaneously)
Blowing out their candles or
(Blowing out their candles, oh!)
Combing out their hair,
Combing out their hair, and they-)
Even when they leave
(Even when they leave you and vanish)
They still are there.
(They somehow can still remain there)
They're there

Judge:
(spoken)
How seldom it is,
One meets a fellow spirit

Todd:
(spoken)
With fellow tastes...
In women, at least

Judge:
(spoken)
What's that?!

Todd:
(spoken)
The years no doubt have changed me
But then, I suppose,
The face of a barber, the face
Of a prisoner in the dark
Is not particulary memorable

Judge:
(shouted)
Beenjamin Barker?!

Todd:
(shouted)
Benjamin Barker!
(sung)
Rest now, my friends
Rest now forever
Sleep now, the untroubled sleep
Of the angels--

Todd:
(spoken)
"Don't I know you," she said..
You knew she lives

Mrs. Lovett:
(spoken)
I was only thinking of you..

Todd:
(muttered)
You lied to me..

Mrs. Lovett:
(simulataneously with todd)
No, no, not lied at all
No, I never lied, said she
Took a poison, she did
Never said that she died
Poor thing, she lived, but it left her weak in
Her head, all she did for months
Was just lie there in bed
Should've been in hospital,
Wound up in bedlam, instead
Poor thing, better you to think
She was dead, yes,
I lied, 'cause I love you
I'd be twice the wive she was!
I love you!
Could that thing have cared for you like me?

Todd:
Lucy, I've come home again
Lucy, oh my God!
Lucy, what have I done
(then)
Todd:
(sung)
Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical, and yet
Appropriate as always
As you've said, repeatedly,
There's little point in
Dwelling on the past
(now simulatneously with mrs. Lovett)
Now come here, my love
Nothing left to fear my love
What's dead, is dead

Mrs. Lovett:
Do you mean it?
Everything I did, I swear,
I thought was only for the best
Believe me, can we,
Still be, married?

Todd:
(sung simulataneously with mrs. Lovett)
The history of the world, my pet
Is learn forgiveness, and try
To forget
And life is for the alive, my dear
So let's keep living it,
Just keep living it
Really living it!

Mrs. Lovett
Oh Mr. Todd, ooh Mr. Todd,
Leave it to me
Don't you see, Mr. Todd,
We'll be comfy cozy, you and me
Mr. Todd, where there's no one nosey
Just keep living it,
Really living it--

Todd:
(sung, holding back tears)
There was a barber and his wife,
And she was beautiful
A foolish barbr and his wife,
She was his reason and his life
And she was beautiful,
And she was virtuous,
And he was, naive
