Song:

[Verse 1]
Fading, so slow, black hole
I feel it slipping away
We're all we've got
If you're lost I'm diving in after you
I would touch the sun I'd come undone
It's true, I'd fall for you

[Bridge]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know I'll follow you down
Wherever you go, if ever you lose your ground
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you
Down

[Verse 2]
You're lost, worn out, face down
Don't know where you're headed to
Right here, right now, somehow I
I'll light the way up for you
I would touch the sun I'd come undone
It's true, I'd fall for you
