Song:

Just when the waves are washing over
Just when you think you're going down
Just when the chill makes you colder
The sun comes out for you
Chorus
And if you could see what's come over me
Then you would know cause I am walking free
The wind at my back, oh
Bathed in afterglow
And as I sit here in this dark dark room
All I seem to feel is light
But I see the color
I see the ruin of the blood we she'd that's ours
Chorus
Hold me now and watch the sun fill the sky
Don't let me down, everything is alright
There is always tomorrow to try
Always tomorrow
