Song:

In a restaurant


Drinkin' beaujoulais wine

You're with your favourite girl
And you're passin' the time



Well, you look through the paper

Five bottles later
Holocaust in the roxy



You're lovin' your lady


I can see

I can see
Burning bones of war



Ashes on the floor


There stands a soldier
In a barbed-wire land


The fear of death in his eyes

And a bottle in his hand

But, now the wine he's drinking

It's got the taste of blood

No more plastic war movies

To show him what it's like



I can see

Burning bones of war
I can see


Ashes on the floor


(Guitar solo)



I can see



Burning bones of war
I can see

Ashes on the floor
