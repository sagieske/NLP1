Song:

Cause I know that time has numbered my days and I go along with everything
You say
But I write home laughing, look at me now, the walls of my town they come
Crumbling down
And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons and I know their choices color
All I've done
But I'll explain it all to the watchman's son I never lived a year better
Spent in love
Cause I know my weakness, know my voice, I'll believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce but I'll be born without a mask
Like the city that nursed my greed and my pride I stretch my arms into the
Sky
I cry Babel, Babel, look at me now, the walls of my town they come
Crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl as though the sea
Will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we've been you know our
Breath is weeak and our bodies thin.
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart.
I should have known I was weaker from the start.
You'll build your walls and I'll play my bloody part.
To tear, tear them down.
Well I'm gonna tear, tear them down.
Know my weakness, know my voice.
I believe in grace and choice.
I know that perhaps my heart is farce but I know that I'll be born without
A mask
