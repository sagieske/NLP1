Song:

My head is saying "no"
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there, under my skin.

Well if this is the face of a sinner
And if heaven is only for winners
Well I don't care
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

Thought that I'd let it slide
But it's me that's slipping in
Thought that I'd go for a ride
Before this crash I'm dying in.

Well if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not so forgiving
Well I don't care
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

I don't care
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

My head is saying "no"
But my heart keeps giving in
So hard to let it go
When it's there, under my skin.

Well if I'm judged on the life I've been living
And if heaven is not so forgiving
Well I don't care
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

I don't care,
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

I don't care,
Cause I won't know
Anybody there.

Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
