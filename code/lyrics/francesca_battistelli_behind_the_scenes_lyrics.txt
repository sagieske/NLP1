Song:

You may think
I'm just fine
How could anything
Ever be out of line?

I take my time
To set the stage
To make sure everything
Is all in place

Even though I've got the lines rehearsed
A picture only paints a thousand words

Things aren't always what they seem
You're only seeing part of me
There's more than you could ever know
Behind the scenes
I'm incomplete and I'm undone
But I suppose like everyone
There's so much more that's going on
Behind the scenes

Sometimes I can't see
Anything
Through the dark
Surrounding me
And at times I'm unsure
About the ground
Beneath my feet
If it's safe and sound

When it's hard to find hope in the unseen
I have peace in knowing it will find me

Things aren't always what they seem
You're only seeing part of me
There's more than you could ever know
Behind the scenes
I'm incomplete and I'm undone
But I suppose like everyone
There's so much more that's going on
Behind the scenes

Things aren't always what they seem
You're only seeing part of me
There's more than you could ever know
Behind the scenes
I'm incomplete and I'm undone
But I suppose like everyone
There's so much more that's going on
Behind the scenes

You may think I'm just fine
How could anything ever be out of line?
