Song:

Swing low sweet cherry
Make it awful
It's your life, it's your party, it's so awful
Let's start a fire
Let's have riot! Yeah it's awful
It was punk
Yeah, it was perfect now it's awful

They know how to break all the girls like you
And they rob the souls of the girls like you
And they break the hearts of the girls

Swing low, cherry, cherry
Yeah it's awful
He's drunk, he tastes
Like candy, he's so beautiful
He's so deep, like dirty water
God, he's awful
You're lost, oh, where's your daddy - he's so awful

And they royalty rate all the girls like you
And they sell it out to the girls like you
To incorporate little girls

Hey, run away with the light
Run away, it's divine
Let's run away, yeah, tonight and
We'll steal the light of the world

Swing low, sweet cherry, yeah, it's awful
You're ripe for the picking, it's so awful
You've got your youth
Don't waste your money
Yeah it's awful
I was punk
Now I'm just stupid
I'm so awful

Oh, just shut up you're only 16
Oh, just shut up you're only 16

If the world is so wrong
Then you can break the mold
With one song
If the world is so wrong
Then you can take it on
With one song

Swing low sweet cherry
Make it awful
They blew it up, just build a new one,
Make it beautiful... Yeah
