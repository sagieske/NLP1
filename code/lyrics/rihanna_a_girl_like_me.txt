Song:

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk
And they dress the same
Nothin' new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see
Right though their disguise
Makes me wonder why
When the whole worlds turnin' left
It's when I'm goin' right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked you to
Take all my dreams
And then make them true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me
Oh, just like me

Possibility
Got me trippin'
Thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me (you and me)
Still I need to know
Should I keep this feelin'
Or let it go
I can't wait no more
So now's the time
To speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you want to take
A chance on something real

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked you to
Take all my dreams
And then make them true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me
Oh, just like me

Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
Wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
Wish I may, I wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

When the whole world's turnin left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me
Is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked you to
Take all my dreams
And then make them true
Show me all the reasons that you ought to be
With a girl like me
Oh, just like me
