Song:

It's been a while since the two of us talked
About a week since the day that you walked
Knowing things would never be the same
With your empty heart and mine full of pain
So explain to me, how it came to this
Take it back to the night we kissed
It was Dublin City on a Friday night
You were vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought would never hurt.
Who would have thought it would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on

Is trying to take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we met
Before our hearts decided
It was time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

There was a time that we'd stay up all night
Best friends talking till the daylight
Took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to loose, but so much to gain
Are you hearing me? Cause I don't wanna miss,
Set you a drift on memory bliss
It was Grafton Street on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

We we're thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Who would have thought it would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on

Is trying to take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we met
Before our hearts decided
It was time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back
Before it all went wrong

If the clouds don't clear
Then we'll rise above it, we'll rise above it
Heavens gate is so near
Come walk with me through
Just like we used to, just like we used to

Let's take it back
Before it all went wrong

Before the worst, before we met
Before our hearts decided
It was time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back
Before it all went wrong
