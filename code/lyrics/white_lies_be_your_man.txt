Song:

I wish no harm to come of you
Split bottles in shopping aisles
Cold rain in front of you
On the inside

I wish no hurt to cover you
Magazine pictures of city-life
Wax smiles, vanilla cream,
The good eyes

Make it an emergency,
I'll be your man

Free on an open ride,
Into the maple glow
Sail on the dusk, we pull
Our love in tow

I wish no guilt to trouble you
No complications on moral lines
Thick dreams of summer dew,
On the inside

I wish no scorn to follow you
I'll be your man, honey I'll be fine
Long days to tower you
Don't cry
