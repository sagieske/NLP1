Song:

(Hinkel)

Can you picture yourself on a paper plane
On a wind of change
And which direction will take you away
Will it have the range

And if you still believe in your dreams
And if they make you see
It's all depending on this careless games

Can you gather yourself from the seeds of love
Just for a lark
Or will you watch the world through your colourful glass
Even when it's dark

And if you still believe in your dreams
And they will make you see
It's all depending on this careless games

Who's the master? Who's the slave

Is it true when you tell me there's a place in the sky
Where you can change your mind
Can you see through this mirror without seeing yourself
When it's you who cries

And if you still believe in your dreams
And they will make you see
It's all depending on this careless games

The dice have been casted
The world is wasted? Goin' down down down

We're goin' down
