Song:

Don't let your eyes get used to darkness
The light is coming soon
Don't let your heart get used to sadness
Put your hope in what is true

No matter how the wind may blow
It cannot shake the sun
Lay your sorrows on the ground
It's time to come back home

When the future seems uncertain
Like the coming of a storm
Your loving Father carries his children
When they can't walk anymore

No matter how the wind may blow
It cannot shake the sun
Lay your sorrows on the ground
It's time to come back home

Oh, back home...
Oh, back home...
Oh, back home...
Oh...

No matter how the wind may blow
It cannot shake the sun
Lay your sorrows on the ground
It's time to come back home

Oh, back home...
Oh, back home...
Oh, back home...
