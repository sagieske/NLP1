Song:

Tonight my bag is packed
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me across the border
Tomorrow my love and I will sleep neath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border
Well leave behind my dear
The pain and sadness we found here
And well drink from the bravos muddy water
Where the sky grows grey and wide
Well meet on the other side
There across the border
For you I'll build a house
High upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border
And sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms neath open skies
Ill kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border
Tonight well sing the songs
Ill dream of you my coraz_n
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the saints blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There across the border
For what are we
Without hope in our hearts
That someday well drink from gods blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the border
