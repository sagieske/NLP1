Song:

I'm finally down to a minute
Can you believe that I've been stuck in this fantasy, yeah
You pull me down to the ceiling
I'm definitely heading out too far to find me

Till I, I end up alone
With you on the phone
How could things get that much better
Don't think, just go it alone
While you're on the phone
I need to set things straight

I know we're through
But I'm still not over you
The things I do
And I'm still not over you
But I can't say that I didn't try
I put myself on the line
And I'm still not over you

I'm holding out at my limit
And I can't believe that you could just sit and watch me
You try to hide what you're feeling
I'm definitely heading out your're bound to find me

But I, I end up alone
With you on the phone
How could things get that much better
Don't think, just go it alone
While you're on the phone
I need to set things straight

I don't care what they say
You're stuck in my mind all day
Can't stop no I won't stop
Even when my heart goes pop
Kinda like how this 808 drops
When you hear it from a mile away
And you remember that time you said
That you couldn't take another chance
Let me make amends, girl this is 100%
