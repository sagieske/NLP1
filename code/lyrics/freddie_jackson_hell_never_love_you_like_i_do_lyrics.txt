Song:

Got someone else to keep you warm.
Youve been seen in cozy places,
But there's a calm before the storm.
Like he's been seen with other faces.

Folks say he changes with the night,
To break her heart is second nature.
Oh girl hell never do you right.
I'm warning you your hearts in danger,
But you can put your love on me,
And you wont be lonely.
I'll be waiting patiently... Cause I love you only.

Chorus
He can never love you like I do, like I do.
No hell never ever love you, baby, like I do.
Ooh hell never ever need you, need you,
Half as much as I do, like I do.
He could never want you, never want you baby, like I do.

I know I can be over sensitive.
Well I wouldn't if you didn't mean so much to me.
The grass always seems greener,
Over on the other side, you see.
But you can bet your love on me,
Girl you wont be lonely, no,
I'm into you totally, you see,
You see I love you only.

Chorus

I see that fire in your eyes,
And all this passion comes as no surprise.
Heres hoping soon you'll recognize,
But until then let me emphasize,

Na, na, na, na, na

Hell never love you, like I do, na, na, na, na, no.
Bet your love on me,
Bet your love on me, and you wont be lonely.
I'm into you totally,
Totally cause I love you only.

Chorus

Hell never ever ever... Like I do... Never... Not like I do.
