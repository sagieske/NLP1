Song:

Had to catch a plan to Nashville but was running oh so late
Checked my luggage at the curb and prayed the plane would wait
I looked like OJ Simpson, racing for gate three
The pilot turned the engines on and I yell 'Wait for me!'

The flight was overbooked and there was someone in my seat
So they took me up to first classs where they get real food to eat
I buckled up, we took off things turned out after all
Til the pilot said 'Welcome to..' I'd flied to Omaha!

Chorus:
First class wrong flight,
What a situation
First class wrong flight
Shoulda checked the destination

I sat there 20 minutes just deciding what to do
I guess I could take up skydiving or hijack all the crew,
I thought why should I sweat it, I'll eat my steak and smile
It's not important where I go I'm going there in style

Chorus

Styling comfort, maybe grand,
But it's important where you land
Make sure the way you choose is right

Well I won't be eating peanuts or hearing something cry
I'll have a lot more leg room it's the only way to fly
I'll get the royal treatment those in coach will envy me
But when we touch down they'll be where they wanna be

Chorus 2x

...always check the destination
children you gone end up where you don't wanna be
Oh it's awful!
You lose your luggage,
you can't find you friends, it's terrible,
I hate it
