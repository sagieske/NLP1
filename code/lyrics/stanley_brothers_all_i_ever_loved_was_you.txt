Song:

All I ever loved was you
You broke a heart that cried for you
I've wasted all my tears on you
For all I've ever loved was you

Go out and find somebody new
But you'll be sorry if you do
You'll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you

Buy her rings and diamonds too
But you'll be sorry if you do
You'll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you
