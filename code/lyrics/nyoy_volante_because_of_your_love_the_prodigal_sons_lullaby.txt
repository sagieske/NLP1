Song:

Because of your love
(The prodigal son's lullaby)

How can I see Your face
And receive Your loving grace
When I am here shamed in sin
Hurting You deep within

Yet everytime I run and flee
You take me home forgiving me
With the skies I feel Your touch
No other love can be this much

You are there as I hide
With Your arms open wide

**For You alone
Have the greatest love the world has ever known
A love that never ceases to embrace a weary heart
And give a brand new start
Provides light where the sun has never shown
Now I can understand
That I am here because of Your love

So I take Your gentle hand
Only to sin again
And yet You turn then stubbornly
You take me home, forgiving me

How can love as great as this
Even want to exist
Oh God of all that's good and true
Please believe I love You too

Though I walk through desert's doors
I will fear nothing more

Repeat ** except last line

That I am here because...
You are there as I hide
With Your arms open wide
Though I walk through desert's doors
I will fear nothing more
Nothing more

Repeat ** except last line

As You take me by the hand
That I am here
Because of Your love
