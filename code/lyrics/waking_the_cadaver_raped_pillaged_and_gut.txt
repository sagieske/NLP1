Song:

Raped, pillaged, and gutted
I could only imagine the fear in your mind
As my hands grab your throat from behind
No doubt
For this b***h
I'll use the pressure point choke out
Because when it comes to s***s
It's a good chance your gonna see my glock, before you see my c***

Dark room awakening, strapped to the table
The lights illuminate my instruments
My pickaxe, snubnose, the sawnoff, the meatcleaver, the chainsaw
You see what the f**k I'm workin' with?
This isn't a dream b***h, to me, your nothing but a hole
So when I look you in the eyes, the only words I say is
I'm in full control

Horror when you see my face
You've seen the blotters in the newspapers, you know I'm famous
So b***h I'm gonna start this s**t with a pickaxe to your a***
Blood pours
