Duet With Denise Laurel

I was a man who always played around in love
So quick to take but so afraid to give enough
But now I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
And time can't take away

I was a girl who trusted no one with my heart
And the dreams that young girls dream
Were just vanishing in the dark
But now I've found the one
And heaven will only know
What only my eyes can say
They say

That I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else in my heart but you
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you

Now my heart belongs to you
And I will always be your best friend
Now my secrets are safe with you
And the magic will never end
Now you are the one
And heaven will only know
What only our eyes can say
They say

That I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
And I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you, anyone else but you.

You (you)... oohhh.
That I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else in my heart but you.
Now I will take you forever
And there will never be anyone else but you
Anyone else but you.
I will girl take you forever
By your side I won't leave you never
I don't need anyone else but you
And I will take you... ohhh... forever. Ohh... 
I will (I will) take you forever
