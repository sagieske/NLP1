Song:

Would you try something new
That you couldn't fake
Who would you dream of you
That your dreams had tales
That you got... In your eyes
Here's another thought of you of a lot
Would you give it all you got
If you knew you would be in love

Would your gates fall, would your bars going down
When your heart comes, would you let it all out?
You know you found bigger love
When it's magic, what you touch turns to gold
And you're screaming for the whole world to know
You know you found bigger love, bigger love

Every mistake that you made
Turns into something better
Every fear that you face
Will just make you stronger
Cause your eyes are all I'm thinking of
Feel your... Like a ghost alone
Would you give it all you got
If you got something you love

Would your gates fall, would your bars going down
When your heart comes, would you let it all out?
You know you found bigger love
When it's magic, what you touch turns to gold
And you're screaming for the whole world to know
You know you found bigger love, bigger love
