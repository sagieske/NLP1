Song:

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa
Go

Inside a wall street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you'll die... I hate people

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Struggling to breathe, go

The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment
S** puts me in the mood to make you die
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Look into sick eyes... I hate people

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Struggling to breathe

Go - a machine of penalty
Go - the sweet insanity
Go - fade to black tranquility

Go - you're looking through the eyes of a psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho

Psycho

Inside a wall street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you'll die... I hate people

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Struggling to breathe

Go - a machine of penalty
Go - the sweet insanity
Go - fade to black tranquility
Go - you're looking through the eyes of a psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho, whoa-oh
An american psycho

Psycho, psycho, psycho, psycho
