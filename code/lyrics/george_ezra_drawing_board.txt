Song:

I'll fill your pillow case up with snakes, 
The man eating kind, 
Though you call yourself a women, 
I doubt it they would mind
Oh mind, 
Oh mind, 

There's just one problem with my plan, 
you spend your nights with another man
Oh you don't rest your head in mine no more
I've gotta take my plug back to the drawing board
Oh my, oh
Oh, my
Oh, my, my

Oh lady, 
I'm a heart ache, 
I'm a desperate plan in hands, 
Oh, I'm a blue-print in the sand, 
Oh my

You mentioned taking a holiday and I recalled you couldn't swim
So I booked us scuba diving off the North coast of Belgium
Oh my, 
Oh my, 

And I drew an image in my head, 
Of you sinking just like led
But I never found you washed up on the shore, 
I've gotta take my plug back to the drawing board
Oh my, oh
Oh, oh, my
Oh, my, my

Oh lately, 
I'm a heart ache, 
I'm a desperate plan in hands
Oh I'm a blueprint in the sand
Oh my

Oh, I'm the one you seldom came to see
Oh, I was hidden, 
Oh, I've been busy working on my scheme, 
Oh, to teach you how to hurt

You said you needed a haircut
I recommended Mr Todd
Of all the men in this big bad world
He's perfect for the job
Oh my, oh
Oh, oh, my
Oh, my, my, 

Oh lately, 
I'm a heart ache, 
I'm a desperate plan in hands
Oh I'm a blueprint in the sand

Oh lately, 
I'm a heart ache, 
I'm a desperate plan in hands
Oh I'm a blueprint in the sand

Oh lately, 
I'm a heart ache, 
and I haven't seen you since
So now I'm praying that your mince all mine
