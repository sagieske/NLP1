Song:

You better come on in my kitchen
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

When a woman gets in trouble
Everybody throws her down
Lookin' for your good friend
None can be found
You better come on in my kitchen
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

The woman I love, took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again
She better come on in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Mama, can't you hear that wind howl?
Oh how the wind do howl

You better come on in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
The woman that I love, I crave to see
She's up the country, won't write to me
Then, you better come on in my kitchen
Goin' to be rainin' outdoors

I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman,
Lonesome blues got me
But she better come on in my kitchen
'Cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

My Mama dead, Papa well's to be
Ain't got nobody to love and care for me
She better come on in this kitchen
'Cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
