Song:

The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire
Your voice is like a angel above
The touch of your hand woman, drives me insane
But baby, I wants to be loved

I'm 'bout every little, thing you do
I even, cherish your hug
Your kisses so sweet honey they can't be beaten
But baby I wants to be loved

Every time I ask you, for a date
You don't come at all or you're, oh so late
I ask you to dance a little spin
You said wait a minute daddy, here come my friend

I love the way you walk when you, pass me by
Even when you, tryin' to snub
The touch of your hand honey, drives me insane
But baby I wants to be loved
