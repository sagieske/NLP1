Well, I got a girl name Boney Maronie
Well, she's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
Oughta see her rock and roll with blue jeans on
She's not very fat just skin and bone

Well, I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree

Well, I told her mama
And I told her papa, too
Well, just exactly what I'm gonna do
Get married on a night of June
And rock and roll by silvery moon

Well, I love her, she loves me
Whoa, how happy now, we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree

(guitar & instrumental)

She's my one and only
She's my heart desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Ev'rybody turns when my baby goes by
She's somethin' to see that really catches the eye

Well, I love her, and she loves me
Whoa, how happy, now we can be
Making lover underneath the apple tree.

(instrumental to end fade)
