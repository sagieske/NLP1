Song:

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I change
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

Yes I love you say for the way I know we've been apart
It's an endless circle a poison arrow to my heart

Saying I-I-I
I love what you do to me
Need you to stay with me
I-I-I
I love you too much to let go

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I change
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I change
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

It's a constant thought of my baby taking up my time
It's an utter vision of you that's playing on my mind

Saying I-I-I
I love what you do to me
Need you to stay with me
I-I-I
I love you too much to let go

How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I change
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
You got me confused by the way I change
How'd you think I feel when you call my name
My name, say my name baby

Oh when you call my name
Oh oh oh
Oh when you call my name
Oh oh oh
Say my name baby
Oh when you call my name
Oh oh oh
Oh when you call my name
Oh oh oh
Say my name baby
