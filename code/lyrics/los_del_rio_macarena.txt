Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Heeeeey Macarena
AAAhAA!

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Heeeeey Macarena
AAAhAA!

Macarena tiene un novio que se llama
Que se llama de apellido Vitorino,
Que en la jura de bandera el muchacho
Se la dio con dos amigos

Macarena, Macarena, Macarena
Que le gusta los veranos de Marbella
Macarena, Macarena, Macarena
Que le gusta la movida guerrilera

Macarena sueсa con El Corte Ingles
Que se compra los modelos mas modernos
Le gustaria vivir en Nueva York
Y ligar un novio nuevo
AAAAhAA!!

When I dance they call me Macarena
And the boys they say que soy buena
They all want me, they can't have me
So they all come and dance beside me
Move with me, chat with me
And if I could I'd take you home with me

Now don't you worry about my boyfriend
The boy who's name is Vitorino
I don't want him, couldn't stand him
He was no good so I
Now come on, what was I suppose to do
He was out of town and his two friends were so fine

Come find me, my name is Macarena
Always at the party con las chicas que estan buenas
Come join me, dance with me
And all you fellas chat along with me


When I dance they call me macarena
And the boys they say that Iґm buena
They all want me, they canґt have me
So they all come and dance beside me
Move with me, chat with me
And if your good i take you home with me
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria macarena
Que tu cuerpo pa' darle alegria cosabuena
Dal a tu cuerpoEeeh, macarena
