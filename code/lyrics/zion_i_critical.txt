Song:

[Zion I]

Yo checkout the superb tech

Cashin' checks through dialect

Doper than the gold around your neck

This is my manuscript to spit lyrics like fat spliffs

I show the whole damn world my gift

For Paris I'm speakin' upon

Powerful just like a pod

Positioned in the proper placement

Focus like militant deep as concentrational caverns

Devising secret plans on spitting atoms

I verbalize

Lust to bust

Just as dangerous

As watching Mt. Vesuvius erupt

Corrupt a data disk

From the super soul powered slums

I-N-I, Planet Asia make it bump, bump

I'm deep off in the trunk

Swats call it crunk

The 15 inch whoofers make the beat go thump

I dump clips of pros? Goes

The chillin' is killin' with the illest type flows

[Hook:]

"Rap legends presidents felt" -> Nas 'Nas is Like'

"Put us together" -> Mobb Deep 'Survival of the Fittest'

"The outcome is Critical" -> gza/Genius

"Set it off" -> Jeru The Damaja 'Mental Stamina'

[Zion I]

Yo, vocally blessed to beat you into submission

I paddle units which protrude from the underside of trains

Do not touch I'm high voltage

Like the third electric

Emergency phones needed in every tunnel for the murder method

You're dealing with the armed forces

We wave warm torches

Through the trenches of the onslaughtness

? Up next

I'm anticipated post my plan is to stay behind my every line stated

Deluxe, eon flux-uate what I pronunciate

Cold verses be lookin' out but y'all people got months to wait

Life as it is baby, Zion I got me flyin' high

My mind's inside music symbolic to I-N-I

This ain't the Sci-Fi Channel

We true and living legends of this beat freak committee

Clash Of the Titans through the vinyl

When we splash the Atlas with the rules of the game

We out the old school and came to drop a jewel on your brain

[Hook:]

[Planet Asia]

My brother hit me on the game

Said that we original man

And we manifested here to spit slang

I thought a minute, and let it sink

Deep like the Titanic

We wider than the ocean of Atlantic

Pacifical mythical styles

In the west it's gettin' wild

I'm chillin' like the Sphinx upon the Nile

Reverberating

Why is you hatin' hip hop we creatin?

Across the desert sands we be bakin'

My melanin

The key to lock rock spots and flocks

Walk the rugged avenue with my B-Boy bop

It's evolution toss a pebble at the devil and smile

I'm rebellion while propelling freestyles

[Zion I]

From the bottom to the top I made a lot of em drop

Hip hop's the lifestyle of urban civilians and even cops

No it don't stop

Once again another classic fantastic rap s**t

That'll make y'all mcs wanna practice

How to lock s**t down like Daddy?

I blaze mics for days

Hit the page light stage and burn Sage

Then engage

This ain't a faze or some played out gimmick

That's worth to? For the fact

That most of y'all cat's is timid, vivid

Views of the do and don't don't apply,

To the uncompromising Planet Asia, Zion I

Worldwide renown

Zones of the chosen few

Verbal rhymes I cipher shots to leave holes in you

[Hook:]
