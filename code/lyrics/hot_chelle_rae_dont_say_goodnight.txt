Song:

Come on don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

Check cashed and I'm ready for the weekend
Blow it all makin' memories with my friends
Two girls on my lap super packed in
It's alright it's alright
Plug the iPod in put on A$AP
Hella loud tryna rap
"You can't rap!"
In her work uniform but she's still bad
It's alright it's alright

Take a deep breath and don't be shy
Don't you worry about tomorrow 'cause tomorrow ain't tonight just
Kick back let the universe align

Come on don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

Super drunk still sayin' that we're just buzzed
Last call everybody's gettin' paired up
Makin' out at the bar call it young love
It's alright it's alright
Let's find a bonfire or we can start one
Throw your middle fingers up to a new sun
'Cause we ain't sober and the party's never over singin'
It's alright it's alright
Take a deep breath and don't be shy
Don't you worry about tomorrow 'cause tomorrow ain't tonight just
Kick back let the universe align

Come on don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight

I feel like we could do almost anything
Got my ride and a sweet little maryjane in those skinny jeans
By my side she gets me high
And I didn't expect this night to go so well

Come on don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please don't say goodnight
