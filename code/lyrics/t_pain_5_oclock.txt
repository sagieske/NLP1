It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you're going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (uh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (uhh)
I pretended I was sleeping (uhh)
And I was hoping you...

[T-Pain]
Eh It's 5 O'Clock in the mornin', and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya
I can see it
Cause you been waiting on me since I said that I was hittin' the club

The sun be comin' up on me
And I know you be gettin' so horny
Cause you be sendin' me textses and
It's like boy just get your a** up in that car and come get all of this love
(It's 5 O'clock in the morning)

You ain't gotta remind me
She already said if I don't come on time she
Might go craazyy
And she'll be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on

She might come and find me, Ohhhhh!
And then ask me kindly, Ohhhh!
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Lily Allen]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning (yeah)
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you're going to bed soon (let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in (goodnight)

[T-Pain and Lily Allen]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Conversation got borin'
You said you're going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you callin'
And these females, got me stallion'
I can hear your voice in my head like
(What is he doin') Ohhh! (what is he doin')

Cause I keep checkin my cell phone, and these missed calls
And you textin' me like Imma kill y'all
If you don't get your a** up outta that club
And do you know what time it is?
(It's 5 O'Clock in the morning)

Ooo, oh my bad girl
This Nuvo got me trippin' and I know that you mad girl
But you ain't gotta worry bout' nuthin'
Girl I got ya
Girl I got ya

She might come and find me, Oh no-no
And then ask me kindly, Oh no-no
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Lily Allen]

Until I heard you come up the stairs (I won't let you stay lonely)
I pretended I was sleeping (alright)
And I was hoping you would creep in (baby girl goodnight)

You said you're going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in
Like it's 5 o'clock in the morning

[Wiz Khalifa]
Aww And you ain't got nuttin' on
But the T-shirt that I left over at your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
To many thirsty girls up in this club
For me to leave here with one of 'em
That's why I call her
And you'll be right at home
Waitin' for me
iPhone plugged in the wall
Just waitin' for me
Club close at 6 left around 4: 30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib (it's 5 O'Clock in the morning)

And you yawnin
But I been drinkin' all night and I feel like performing'
With you in the bedroom
Floor to the dresser
Don't want nothin' less
'Cause I'm sure you're the best you're the one
So I let you
That's how you show me love
And when we finish you like damn babe you woke me up
I love the way you put it down like this for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up
