Song:

Times I'm uncertain I can't unwind
The s**t we learned became a lie
Can't live forever angry and blind
The lengths we go to satisfy

It's a natural high

I'm not your savior no fu***n' lie
I'd kill myself to stay alive
Forget the future regret the past
No present tense is gonna last

Swimming in a sea of a jealous tide
Won't wash your hate away
Selling your soul for a piece of mind
Can't buy yourself today

Ain't it funny how the power the money
The consistency of the truth
Bleed today but laugh tomorrow
In the burden of our youth
