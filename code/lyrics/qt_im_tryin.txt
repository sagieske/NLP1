Verse 1
My past overshadows what's goin on right now
And it hurts so bad
I never thought I'd be all by myself,
But then I made you mad
Too many times before, that's why you locked the door
On our love
Then you threw away the key
Now I'm looking out the window
Seeing you With someone else.

Pre-Chorus
I know I made mistakes before but this one
Hit the books, now I'm just history
I can't adjust to the fact that you ain't comming back
And it just eats at me!

Chorus
I'm trying
Not to think about the past
Reminiscing on the the love we had
I'm trying
And it's killing me Inside
Cause I had to let you go Bye-Bye
I'm trying

Verse 2
To figure out what's next, oh
Tryna figure out where to go
It's like I'm lost and I'll never be found
Without my love around
Searchin! Tryna find the answers to the riddle
Felling so little in this big ol world
And I hear the clock ticking
Tick tock, Aftershock, that's what my bodies feeling!

Pre-Chorus
I know I made mistakes before but this one
Hit the books, now I'm just history
I can't adjust to the fact that you aint comming back
And it still eats at me!

Chorus
I'm trying
Not to think about the past
Reminiscing on the the love we had
I'm trying
And it's killing me Inside
Cause I had to let you go Bye-Bye
I'm trying

Bridge
I'm trying to forget about the hugs and the kisses
It hurts to know that a part of me is missing
My better half, my All I have
Aint comming back, I'm trying!

Chorus
I'm trying
Not to think about the past
Reminiscing on the the love we had
I'm trying
And it's killing me Inside
Cause I had to let you go Bye-Bye
I'm trying
