Song:

Gonna start dressing
Finer things
Maybe just nothing
Maybe just a dream

You are gonna find him one day knockin at your door
Hes not the hero any more
He says baby don't you want me in your life
You tell him what is wrong, not right

Don't She La
don't she look happy
don't She La
don't she look happy

Gonna start living
Fantasy
Maybe just nothing
Maybe just a dream

Fire in the blue sky when he hits you in the mouth
This the war and not the warning
He says baby I love you wont you stay
You say good-bye to him too late

Don't She La
don't she look happy
don't She La
don't she look happy
don't she look happy now
that hes gone away from here
Hes gone away he died they say an awful way
It was attack of the heart

You have started something big
by cuttin through the man
There was a sign you heard a calling
He says baby I don't wanna die today
You say so long man its too late
