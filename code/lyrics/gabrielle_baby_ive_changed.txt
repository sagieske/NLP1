Song:

Too many times
You let me down
When I needed you
You could not be found
So I picked up the pieces
And tried to mend
My broken heart

Then you'd reappear
Always acting like
Nothing was wrong
Everythings just fine
Want us to get back together
Get back into my life

Cos I don't mind
Where you go
Please don't come around
Or call this your home
Cos I don't mind
Where you go
As long as you're not here

Baby baby babe
What did you think I'd say
That I'd take you back again
Oh baby I've changed

Now you say
You can't believe it
How can I close
The doors on you
Could it be that youve forgotten
That you treated me so cruel

You made your choice
Cos you stayed away
For much too long
Now it's way too late

Did you want me to sit around and wait
Like I've always done

Cos I don't mind
Where you go
Please don't come around
Or call this your home
Cos I don't mind
Where you go
As long as you're not here

Baby baby babe
What did you think I'd say
That I'd take you back again
Oh baby I've changed

Youve always got what you wanted
You knew I'd always oblige
Id always keep the door open
Waiting for you to decide

Cos too many times
Youve let me down
When I needed you
You could not be found
So I picked up the pieces
Tried to mend
My broken heart

Cos I don't mind
Where you go
Please don't come around
Or call this your home
I don't mind
Where you go
As long as you're not here

Cos I don't mind?
