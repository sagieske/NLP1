Song:

And I can't believe forever it seems to live out these dreams

When you start to think about taking a chance you can't give a damn

Huh I'm a hopeless romantic fell in love with a simple idea with a little bit luck and a whole lotta work I can make everyone of these visions real

So we don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never

Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never.

We don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never

It's time to decide if it's worth the fight or letting it slide

And I drew the line at wasting away or waiting to be saved

Yay y'all made my own luck in my head on straight and kicked up the dust

And the money well it don't mean much I did it for the love and that was enough

The way I dreamed it ain't the way it played out missed every road that looked to be the safe route. No directions I made my way out I don't give a damn what they say no way now.

We don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now... Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never.

We don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never.

I'm about to get mine mine mine it's about that time

We don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never.

Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's now or never.

We don't care what the people say and we don't care what they want to do and we don't care about it anymore we do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never I'm about to get mine it's now or never
