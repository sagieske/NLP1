Song:

I've got the feeling
There's no concealing
Just what it is that's on my mind
I know that I'm losing you
There's no pretending there's a happy ending
This stories closing and there's nothing more
Can it be that I've lost you?
I've seen it happen
I know the pattern
The way true love disappears
Just when now more than ever
I need you
I need your love
I'm losing the love that I knew
Losing the love that I knew
I'm losing you
No use in staying
No use in saying
Or begging you to change
I know that I've lost you
My heart it's breaking
The time it's taking
Our love away I see it fade
And with it my happiness
I can't believe
I won't believe it
I won't accept your love is gone
Just when now more than ever I need you
I need your love
I'm losing the love that I knew
Losing the love that I knew
I'm losing you
