Song:

Here we stand in ravishing rain
Joy is like pain
It feels like a miracle
You can't turn back, you're in chains
Never again
Return from a cynical world

If you feel you've loved me in vain
Why not re-live your guilty love affairs
In the warm breeze you will cry
Again and again
That's fate for a criminal

Good intentions lost in thin air
You were craving for affection
And a certain invitation
Led you here to me in the cynical world

No one but me, in this cold place
I will love and serve you, criminal
That's your final consolation
Now hang on to me, in the cynical world
