Song:

It's a little cold out side tonight
But I was to close not to say hi
You know I talked to a friend of yours at school
She gave me the impression that you might be cool

With a guy like me
With a girl like you
Oh, could you ever see a guy like me
With a girl like you

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it

Cause all along it's been you on my mind
That something special about you
That's hard to find
I know every girl searching for romance
And I'm wondering if you'd take a chance
On a guy like me with a girl like you
Oh, could you ever see a guy like me with a girl like you
Like you, like you

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it

I'm a fool for you Cheyenne (X3)
I'm not playing I'm just saying
I can't live without you

Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Am I a fool for fool for falling for you girl?
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break my heart Cheyenne
Please don't break it
Please don't break it
