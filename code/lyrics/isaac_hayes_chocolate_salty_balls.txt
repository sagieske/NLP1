Song:

Two tablespoons of cinnamon and two or three egg whites
A half a stick of butter, melted, stick it all in a bowl
Baby, stir it with a wooden spoon
Mix in a cup of flour you'll be in heaven soon

Say everybody have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Oh, suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed vitamins
And good for you, so suck on balls

Pour in a cup of unsweetened chocolate
And a half a cup of brandy
Then throw in a bag or two of sugar
And just a pinch of vanilla

Grease up the cookie sheet
'Cause I hate when my balls stick
Then preheat the oven to threefifty
And give that spoon a lick

Say everybody have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Oh, suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed full of goodness
And high in fiber, so suck on balls

Hey, wait a minute, what's that smell?
It smells like somethings burning
Well, that don't bother me none
As long as I get my rent paid on Friday
Baby, you better get back in the kitchen
'Cause I got a sneak suspicion

Oh man, baby, baby, you just burnt my balls
My balls are on fire, come on
My balls are burning, gimme some water
Pour some water on 'em, o goodness
Blow on them, do something

Say everybody have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
(They're on fire baby)
If you ever need a quick pick me up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Oh, suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
(Put 'em out, blow on 'em)
Suck on my balls baby

Suck on my balls, baby
Suck on my red hot salty chocolate balls
Woo, woo, suck on my balls
(Blow, blow, blow)
