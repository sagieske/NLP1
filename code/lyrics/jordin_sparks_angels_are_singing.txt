Song:

On the top the Christmas... Gave to me
Twelve... Eleven... Is pippin
Ten on... Nine ladies dancing
Eight... Milking, seven... Swimming
Six... Five through the...
Four falling birds, the three French hands
Two turtle dugs and a... In that...

Chorus:
Angels are singin
The snow is fallin down
The bells are ringin
Can't you hear them
Can you hear the sound

On the top the Christmas... Gave to me
Twelve... Eleven... Is pippin
Ten on... Nine ladies dancing
Eight... Milking, seven... Swimming
Six... Five through the...
Four falling birds, the three French hands
Two turtle dugs and a... In that...

Chorus:
Angels are singin
The snow is fallin, it's falling down

The bells are ringin
Can't you hear them
Can you hear the sound
Angels are singin
The snow is it's falling all around
The bells are ringin
Can't you hear them
Can you hear the sound

Let the light come shining...
Just make a wish it will come true
My love came to me

Chorus:
Angels are singin
The snow is it's falling all around
The bells are ringin
Can't you hear them
Can you hear the sound
Angels are singin
The snow is fallin, it's falling down
The bells are ringin
Can't you hear them
Can you hear the sound
Can't you hear it
Can you hear it, I will miss it
