Song:

April 26th, 1992, there was a riot on the streets
Tell me, where were you?
You were sittin’ home, watchin’ your tv
While I was paticipatin’ in some anarchy

First spot we hit it was my liquor store
I finally got all that alcohol I can’t afford
With red lights flashin’, time to retire
And then we turned that liquor store into a structure fire

Next stop, we hit it was the music shop
It only took one brick to make that window drop
Finally we got our own P. A., where do you think
I got this guitar that you’re hearing today? Hey

When we returned to the pad to unload everything
It dawned on me that I need new home furnishings
So once again we filled the van until it was full
Since that day my livin’ room’s been more comfortable

'Cause everybody in the hood has had it up to here
It’s getting harder and harder and harder each and every year
Some kids went in a store with their mother
I saw her when she came out she was gettin' some pampers

They said, it was for the black man
They said, it was for the Mexican and not for the white man
But if you look at the streets it wasn't about Rodney King
It’s this f****d up situation and these f****d up police

It’s about coming up and staying on top
And screamin’, "187" on a motherfuckin’ cop
It’s not written on the paper it’s on the wall
National Guard smoke from all around

Let it burn, wanna let it burn, wanna let it burn
Wanna, wanna let it burn, I feel insane
Riots on the streets of Miami

Oh, riots on the streets of Chicago
On the streets of Long Beach, then San Fransisco
Riots on the streets of Kansas City

Oh, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Cleveland, Ohio
Fountain Berry, Paramount, Vista Belle
Eugene, Oregon Eureka, California

Hesperia, Santa Barbara
Mot*****in' Nevada, Phoenix, Arizona, San Diego
Lakewood, Florida, fu***n' 29 Palms
