Song:

Well I heard she flew down to the Mountain City
He said that's not what I heard I hear she went higher
She depended on her friends to tell her when to stop it
To make a statement this is me talking to you
Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name call out my name
But I get no answer she prays
Better run for your life cried the Mad Hatter
Alright said Alice I'm going back
To the other side of the mirror I'm going back
Oh no, you cannot tell a gypsy ooh, that she's no longer a member
Become a deadly weapon now along with everything else
Oh call my name
Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass
But I get no answer she used to know who she was
And she prays for the world that she comes from
Each had their own charm
Buried beneath a solid piece of armour or a steel plated vest
Some carry a stiletto in their garter along with everything else
That they carry oh, call my name
Like Alice through the Looking Glass
She used to know who she was
Call out my name like Alice through the Looking Glass
But I get no answer (she used to know who she was
And she prays for the world that she comes from
Alice! Call my name
Ooh run for your life said the Mad Hatter
Alright said Alice I'm going back to the other side of the mirror
This is me talking to you well this is me talking to ya
Alice Alice
