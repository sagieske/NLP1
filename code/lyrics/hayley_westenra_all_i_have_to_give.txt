Lyrics: James Hall/Boh Runga

Just one bell rang on Christmas day.
Just one sound kept the cold away.
Just one hope that it's part might play.
On this frosty morning.

Oh! What gifts might the angels bring,
If their choice was of everything?
Maybe just that more bells might ring,
On this frosty morning.

Oh! But I wish for you at Christmas,
A song that is open and true.
To light up your world through your darkest hour,
And last the whole year through.

And all that I hope for you is laughter and joy
Throughout all the days you live.
If that's brought with love, then my gift of love,
