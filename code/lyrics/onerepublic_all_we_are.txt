Song:

I tried to paint you a picture
The colors were all wrong
Black and white didn’t fit you
And all along

You were shaded with patience
Your strokes of everything
That I need just to make it
And I believe that

That I could tear you apart
But it won’t break
Anything that you are
You are

We won't say our goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It’s just a moment of change

All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
Our love is at a bind

I walked a minute in your shoes
They never would have fit
I figured there’s nothing to lose
I need to get

Some perspective on these words
Before I hunt them down
You’re an island and my ship
Has run aground

Time to tear you apart
But it won't break
Anything that we are
We are

We won't say our goodbyes
You know it’s better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It’s just a moment of change

All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
Our love is at a bind

Every single day that I can breathe
You changed my philosophy
I’m never gonna let you pass me by

So don’t say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It’s just a moment of change

So don’t say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
It’s just a moment of change

All we are, all we are
Is everything that’s right
All we need, all we need
Our love is at a bind

So don’t say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won’t break, we won’t die
