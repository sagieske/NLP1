Song:

Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien Alien

Through the carnage of the crash
Baby I'm with you
And the photos in a flash
Baby I'm with you
Through violent seas
Baby I'm with you
Until release
Baby I'm with you
And all the animals in the park
Are waiting for their dinner to come
And all the creatures in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

Alien Alien

Through electronic desire
Baby I'm with you
And the elements of fire
Baby I'mwith you
Through everything
Baby I'm with you
All the counterfeited scream tonight
When all the elevated
Become illuminated

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Are waiting for the light to come on

Alien, alien, alien, alien, alien, alien, alien

We are the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
God loves the aliens, we are, we are, we are alien
All the animals in the park, alien
And all the strangers that wake up in the dark
Alien
