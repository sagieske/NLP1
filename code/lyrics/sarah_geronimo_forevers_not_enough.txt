Song:

If I would have to live my life again
I'd stay in love with you the way I've been
Your love is something no one ever can replace
I can't imagine life with someone else
I promise, I will share my life with you
Forever may not be enough it's true
My heart is filled with so much love
I feel for you
No words can say how much I love you so
And if forever's not enough for me to love you
I'd spend another lifetime baby,
If you ask me to
There's nothing I won't do
Forever's not enough for me to love you so
They say tomorrow seems so far away,
And now we see that everything can change
My love for you gets stronger as tomorrow comes
I know this love will stand
The test of time
And if forever's not enough for me to love you
I'd spend another lifetime baby,
If you ask me to
There's nothing I won't do
Forever's not enough for me to love you so
For you, there's nothing I can't do
And never will I ever go
Forever's not enough to love you so
But if forever ends one day
I promise you
I'll stay to show you
That my love will never end...
And if forever's not enough for me to love you
I'd spend another lifetime baby,
If you ask me to
There's nothing I won't do
Forever's not enough to love you so
And if forever's not enough for me to love you
I'd spend another lifetime baby,
If you ask me to
There's nothing I won't do
Forever's not enough for me to love you so.
