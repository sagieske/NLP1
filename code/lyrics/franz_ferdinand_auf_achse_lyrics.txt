Song:

You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you

You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you

She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what've you done

And now you wish she'd never, come back here again
Oh never, come back here again

You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you

You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you

She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what you've done boy
She's not so special so look what you've done

And now I'm nailed above you
Gushing from my sides
It's with your sins that you have killed me
Thinking of your sins I die
Thinking how you let them touch you
How you never realized
That I'm ripped and hang forsaken
Knowing never will I rise
Again

You still see her
Oh you hear her
You want her
Oh you want to

You see her
You still hear her
You want her
You still want to
