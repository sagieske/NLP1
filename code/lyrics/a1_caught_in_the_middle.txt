Song:

[Paul:] You said that love was just a state of mind
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find
And for me you never really had the time
I was blind.

[Christian:] And everything that you meant to me
Is written in the pages of my history
But it's over now as far as I can see
Suddenly

[Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle

[Mark:] Moving on she brings me brighter days
Thoughts of you are in my mind always
Like a memory that I can't erase
It's here to stay

[Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle

[All:] So different
([Mark:] it's so different)
So easy
(
But I can't get over you
([Ben:] I can't get over you)
So different
([Paul:] it's so different)
So easy
([Mark:] so easy)
But I can't get over you
([Ben:] and I can't get over you)

[Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle

[Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
[All:] And now I'm caught
[Ben:] And now, I'm caught in the middle

[Ben:] Things are so different now you're gone
I thought it'd be easy I was wrong
And now I'm caught
Caught in the middle
Even though I'm with someone new
All I can think about is you
And now, I'm caught in the middle
