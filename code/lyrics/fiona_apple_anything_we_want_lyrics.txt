Song:

My cheeks were reflecting the longest wave lengths
My brow was folded up and grazing my forehead
And I kept touching my neck to guide your eye
Of where I wanted you to kiss me
When we find some time alone

My scars were reflecting the mist in your head lights
I looked like a neon zebra shaking mane off her stripes
And the rivulets had to riveted
To the places where that I wanted you to kiss me
When we find some time alone

And then, we can do anything we want
And then, we can do anything we want
And then, we can do anything we want
And then, we can do anything we want

Started sipping the water
And now we try to swallow the wave
And we try not to let those b******s get us down
We don't worry anymore cause we know when the dark comes we get rain
After all, look around, it's happening, it's happening,
It's happening now

Let's pretend we're eight years old playing hooky
I'll draw on the wall, and you can play ufc rookie
Then we'll grow up, take our clothes off
And you'll remind me that I wanted you to kiss me
When we find some time along

And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
And then we can do anything we want
