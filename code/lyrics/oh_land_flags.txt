Song:

It's incredibly handsome, 
The teeth so white
You smile to the cameras
And speak for your rights
While I empty the fridge and kick off the sneaks
And pop off the lid and then
Here's what I would have done
Would have never done wrong
And the telly's still on while…

[Chorus:]
You say that you did it
You came up with it
You ran to the summit waving all the flags
I would be
I could be
Miraculously
Tomorrow I'm coming
Waving all the flags

And the tank's still rolling
The dust still itch
My face still nowhere
While you're spirits' at risk
And I empty the fridge and kick off the sneaks
And pop off the lid and then
Here's what I would have done
Would have never done wrong
And the telly's still on while…

[Chorus:]
You say that you did it
You came up with it
You ran to the summit waving all the flags
I would be
I could be
Miraculously
Tomorrow I'm coming
Waving all the flags

It's too easy to sit and point your finger like a hypocrite
But I'm gonna be the first to admit
That it's hard not to quit
When you're outrun, and everything drown
In the horizon
Gone gone gone

Climb the ladder, climb the ladder
Gonna show you one day I can do the walk
Aiming at, aiming at the top
‘Cause I am a sharp shooter

[Chorus:]
You say that you did it
You came up with it
You ran to the summit waving all the flags
I would be
I could be
Miraculously
Tomorrow I'm coming
Waving all the flags

Doctors' appointment at 10:30

2pm meeting Maja for the Uruguay game
Call Farra
Do the laundry
