Song:

Into this world
Little boy brave
Charity heart
Faithfully plays
Heal the scars
Unto his eyes
Salvage the goodness
Of dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
With no place to go now
Little boy brave
Wanders the streets
Faithfully plays
But his broken arrows
Once filled with pride
Aimed and missed
At the dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
Never give in
Never give up
Little boy brave
Never lived
Never died

Appears to be
Blind Revolution Mad
The mercy ends
Where the mercy began
Seems justified
I'm turnin' this around
Jawbreaker Lawmaker
Have it your way

Campaign smokescreen
Glorifies the mainstream
Cities on remote control
Meanwhile vigilante gangs
Dig their fangs into the streets
They've overthrown
While plastic faces
Run for king of this
Disassociation land
I'm dying to find
Anyone who understands
Behold........

One more Blind Revolution Mad
One more chance of a lifetime

Rage runs rampant
Always been abandoned
Killin' for some pocket change
Blames being force fed rules
Governed by fools
Slammin' you against the grain
And the nation's glued to CNN
To watch their own creation
Behold

One more Blind Revolution Mad
One more chance of a lifetime
One more Blind Revolution Mad

Fee Fi Fo Fum
One for all and all for one
Don't try to stop me
I've already gone crazy
One for all and all for one
Overthrow your kingdom come
Don't try to stop me
You're the reason I'm crazy
Behold

One more Blind Revolution Mad
One more chance of a lifetime
One more Blind Revolution Mad
Mind in the gutter turned
another boy bad
Oh behold
