Song:

Quincy Jones featuring Ray Charles & Chaka Khan

I want to know, baby
Just how you feel, girl
Said I want to know
If what you feel is real

Cause there's a reason
For the things that I say
And, oh, I want to love you, girl
In a special way
Come here, woman

We've been together
For so very long
I'd hate to break up
Break up our happy home

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try

I'll be good to you

[Chorus:]
I'll be good to you
Good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you
Good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you
Good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Girl, we've been
Together so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up my happy home
(Let me take off your shoes)

Take a stand now
And let me know how
All of your ways, baby, baby
And all your know hows

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try

[Chorus:] 2X

Girl, I'll be good to you, baby
You know I'll be good to you
Take you shopping
You know what I mean, baby

Anything you want, I'll be good to you
I'll give it up, with my credit cards
Like Visa, Mastercharge
American Express
Turn my pants upside down
Any day of the week

Oh, oh, you, you, you
Come here, give me love
Talk to me

(Good to you, good to you, good to you)
Girl I'll be good to you
(Good to you, good to you, good to you)
(I'll be good to you, good to you
(Good to you)I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you)

I'll be good to you,
Said I will, I ain't lying, baby

(Good to you
Good to you, good to you)
I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you)

Girl, I'll be good to you
(I'll be good to you)
(Good to you, good to you)
I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you, I said I will
I ain't lying, baby

Good to you, good to you...
