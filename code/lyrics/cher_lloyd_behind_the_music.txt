Song:

No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song
It won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls
And All the money in this world
They don't mean s**t, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up
Show 'em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your
Hands up
Tell them what the truth is
Stand behind the music

You gotta get behind
Cross your heart, hope to die
Splash a hype
Dash a pretty that don't mean I'll buy
Ok alright already
They gettin money
All the frauds, all the phonies, all the fakes
Slow down
It's the fast pace world
Breathe, breathe
Look my face in the mirror say
"Who the hell am I? "
Look me in the eye
Is this conviction or addiction or a waste of time?

Just name a genre
Yeah I've tried it
Been doin' this from 15 to life, yeah
I need a break already
I gotta find it
And for the first time in my life, I'm doing my s**t
I, I, I, I wanna stand in this
Pop tart candy
Girls getting famous, getting naked, gettin' randy
Chew it up
Make my teeth rot
You think I'm talkin' to ya?
I'm probably not, nah

No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song
It won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls,
All the money in this world
They don't mean s**t, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

Re-Rewind
When I was a little younger
Lookin' for a label and a little clean danger
L. A had taste for a (new adventure)
Open every 'do not enter'
Yeah I was tryin' hard to be somebody
Be the cool kid at the party
Lookin' at me laddy daddy, hottie hottie, hot tamale
Stranger sizin' up my body
Told me I could be somebody
Wait,
Someone stopped me, went home and I called my mommy
Oh no, I'm not that girl
I still wanna be the leader of the fr-fr-free world
Yeah I'm a big dreamer
I'm a believer
Just try to tell me no, I'm a go full steamer
No, can't slow me down
I built this house from the inside out
Block by block from the bottom to the top
I know just who I am
And I know just who I'm not

No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song
It won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
All the fame, all the girls,
All the money in this world
They don't mean s**t, better admit
If you can't stand behind the music

So stand up, show em how we do it
Won't back down until I see your hands up
Tell them what the truth is
Stand behind the music
Yeah, stand up, come on let me see your
Front row to the nose bleeders
Hands up, if you really need it
Stand behind the music

No you don't stand a chance
For a second in my world
The same old song
It won't last long
If you can't stand behind the music
