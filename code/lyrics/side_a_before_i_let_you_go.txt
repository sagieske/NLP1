Song:

It's almost daybreak so soon
What did you do with that moon
Her silver light is gone
I want her to go on
Believing we will never see the dawn

What do I say now to you
When every word sounds untrue
I'll scream and I will cry
Before I let goodbye
Pass the lips that kissed you last night

That sun will turn to ice
Right before your eyes
In the circle of your arms
I will watch as worlds collide
And I'll breath the last breath
I will ever know
Before I let you go

Hearts do get broken sometimes
When love gives us mountains to climb
But I would rather die
Than know we never tried
To make it to forever on the other side

That sun will turn to ice
Right before your eyes
In the circle of your arms
I will watch as worlds collide
And I'll breath the last breath
I will ever know
Before I let you go

When you touch me
I just close my eyes
And the heartbeat of my body
Will be telling you why

That sun will turn to ice
Right before your eyes
In the circle of your arms
I will watch as worlds collide
And I'll breath the last breath
I will ever know
Before I let you go
