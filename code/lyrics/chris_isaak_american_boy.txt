Song:

I'm the original american boy
Love you baby, with all my heart
Ten times better than those movie stars
What you see, is what you are
I'm no james dean baby,
But you know I care
If you ever need me, I'll be there, always there

Don't you know I love you more each day
Don't you know I will always feel this way
You can count on me I'm here to stay

I'll go crazy if I stay inside
Come on baby, take a ride
Take you places that we've never been
Don't be shy, hop on in
I ain't no hollywood baby
You can't find a friend, they all say they love you
But just pretend, mine never ends

I'm the original american boy
Can't you see, you're made for me
Tell me baby that you want me too, I'd do anything for you
I get a crazy feeling, when I look at you
Don't ask me if I want you, you know I do
Only you
I'm the original american boy, yeah I'm the original american boy
