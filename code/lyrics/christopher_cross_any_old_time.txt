Song:

Everyone maybe once or twice
Finds a friend that's a friend for life
Somebody who believed in me like you
From those days of childhood fights
Through the nights when we'd ask advice
All of those times when nobody else would do

Any old time that you wanna hear from me
To find your way or kick around a memory
Like the old times
Any old time will do


I can tell when the telephone rings
It's gonna be you just to talk about things
It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind
Every time good love goes bad
When I can't believe the luck I've had
All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine


Any old time that you need to call on me
To find your way or kick around those memories
Like the old times
Any old time will do


Don't you ever forget
Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb
And you think maybe you've had enough
Just like the old times
Any old time you're blue


All at once I went and got a hunch
Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said


Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold
Something Sally said that stuck in my head
And I never wanna let it go


Any old time that you need to lean on me
I'll be there -- you can dream on me
Just like the old times
Any old time will do
