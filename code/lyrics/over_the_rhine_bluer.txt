Song:

I cry just a little bit, just a little bit, everyday
Get by just a little bit, just a little bit that way
I know, I know, I should have known

Bluer, than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel
Bluer than all of my troubles
Love is never far from danger

I die just a little bit, just a little bit, everyday
Get by just a little bit, just a little bit, that way
Let go, let go now that you've gone

Bluer, than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel
Bluer than all of my troubles
Are we gonna leave here strangers?

Bluer, than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel
Bluer than all of my troubles
Love is never far from danger

Bluer, than the blue devils
Bluer than this pale blue angel
Bluer than all of my troubles
Are we gonna leave
Are we gonna leave here strangers?
