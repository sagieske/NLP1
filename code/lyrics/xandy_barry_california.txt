Song:

California with a busted headlight
Here we are dancing in the twilight
So just close your eyes
Cause we're still alone
When the sun goes down
It's too late to go home and you say

Where has love gone now?
Where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Where has it?

It's living in the arms around you
So don't let go
I never wanna live without you
I think you know if we run tonight
We can go to the other side
Keep a souvenir of a desperate year
I'm never gonna make it alone

Mexico the war is on the radio
Border lights casting endless shadows

Where has love gone now?
Where has it gone?
Where has it gone?
Where has it?

It's living in the arms around you
So don't let go
I never wanna live without you
I think you know if we run tonight
We can go to the other side
Keep a souvenir of a desperate year
I'm never gonna make it alone

Miles goby they fly
They won't separate us
By your side I won't disappear
I won't disappear
