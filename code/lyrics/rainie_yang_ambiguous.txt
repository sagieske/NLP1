Song:

Ambiguous let people feel wronged
Could not find the evidence of loving each other
When should go forward, when should give up
Even do not have courage to hug

Ambiguous make people become greedy
Until waiting lost its means
Pity that me and you could not write out an ending
To put the regretful beauty

Only can accompany you till here
Afterall there are some disallow matters
Surpassing friendship still not reaching the love stage
The scenery in the distant location is going to rain

Should or should not cry
Thinking too much I still think of you
I feel very inconvincing
And starting to doubt
Is the person in front of me the same real you
