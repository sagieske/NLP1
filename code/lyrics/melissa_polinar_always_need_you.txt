Song:

I.
I've made up my mind
To get tangled up with you
Even though I'm undeserving
More than the sunshine
Up in the great big blue
You satisfy my every yearning

You're like an arrow out of nowhere
You hit the center of my heart

Chorus:
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you
Always need you... Ohhhh... Yeahh...

Ii.
Now that I'm here
Everyday is new
I'm not going to look any longer
It's all so clear
Everything pales to you
Oh, your love just makes me stronger

Like a shadow tied to your heel
I'll follow wherever you go

Chorus:
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you

Bridge:
I wanna climb to the top of a hill somewhere
And scream at the top of my lungs
The rain may come but I don't care
I'm gonna keep tellin' everyone that...

Chorus:
Your love is good
Your love is real
It captures everything that I feel
I need you now
I needed you then
And I will always need you

Your love is good...
Your love is real...
It captures everything that I feel...
I need you now...
I needed you then...
And I will always need you...
Always need you... Ohhhh... Yeahh...
