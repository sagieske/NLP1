Song:

Round and round, You're turning me inside out.
You're burning me down, down, down.
You're spilling me to the ground.
(You're killing me)

This ain't no one night stand.
I wanna do it again! 

She's like cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vicadin.
She's my addicion. (my addiction)
She's cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vicadin.
She's my addiction, (my addiction)

Upside down! 
You're taking me underground
Your breaking me down, down, down.
You're tearing me inside out.
You burry me.

This ain't no one night stand.
I gotta do it again and again! 

She's like cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vicadin.
She's my addicion. (my addiction)
She's cocaine, heroin, alcohol, vicadin.
She's my addiction, (my addiction)
You're my addiction! 

She's like cocaine, herion, alcohol, and vicadin.
She's my addcition.
She's like cocaine, herion, alcohol, and vicadin
You're my addiction.
