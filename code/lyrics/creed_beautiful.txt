Song:

She wears a coat of color
Loved by some, feared by others
She's immortalized in young men's eyes

Lust she breeds in the eyes of brothers
Violent sons make bitter mothers
So close your eyes, here's your surprise

The Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She Stripped me

In your mind she's your companion
Vile instincts often candid
Your regret is all that's left

The Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She Stripped me

[Guitar Break]

She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own
I think I'll go there on my own
She told me where I'm going
And it's far away from home
I think I'll go there on my own
I think I'll go there on my own

The Beautiful is empty
Beautiful is free
Beautiful loves no one
Beautiful stripped me
Stripped me
Stripped me
She Stripped me
She Stripped me
Stripped me
