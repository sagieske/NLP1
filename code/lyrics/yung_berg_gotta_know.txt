Song:

Uuuh
Cause I need somebody who can stand by me
For the good times and bad times
She will always be by me baby

He ain't got to know
He ain't
He ain't got to know
He ain't
He ain't got to know about me
He ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know about me

Uuuh (What you feel like

You can let me know the real baby
Don't wanna feel like
You don't wanna live here baby
(I got you, girl, I got you)
Doing everything you said you want
They had a bunch of new clothes

(Hold up!) I know you got a man, I know
But I don't think he can handle you
And then you made things, I know

He ain't do you like me
He ain't love you like me
He hate it doing it from the back like me

Cause I need somebody who can stand by me
For the good times and bad times
She will always be by me baby

He ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know about me
He ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know about me

Wanna feel like
I don't care how you're feeling like baby
Just need you right here baby
Cause I got you girl
(I got you)
Doing that thing you said you want
For show she calls that n***a
We face time on that ball

I know you got a man, I know
But I don't think he can handle you
I know you got plans girl
But listen up
I make plans with you

He ain't do you like me
He ain't love you like me
He hate it doing it from the back like me

Cause I need somebody who can stand by me
For the good times and bad times
She will always be by me baby

He ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know about me
He ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know
He ain't he ain't got to know about me

It's been a long time
But we got to be in this baby
It's been a long time
But we got to be in this baby
It's been a while I know
But I'mma get this girl, come on
