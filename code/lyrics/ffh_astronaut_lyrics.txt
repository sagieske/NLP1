Song:

As I look through the evening sky
I think to myself
How much He must love you and I
The Milky Way makes me look
Like a piece of dust on the road
But the Milky Way is a speck of dust
Compared to my Lord
That's how big He is
That's how big He is
And I don't know that much about astronauts
But I know that Jesus cares an awful lot
He made the stars
He made the moon
Just think of how much more
He loves you
Space may be the final frontier
For a lot of people who show no fear
They step outside and they look around
They take a sample and come back down
Have they ever found the meaning of life out there
I don't think so, no way
I don't think so
