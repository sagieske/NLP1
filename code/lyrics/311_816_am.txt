Song:

Stranger flowers yet
There will never come a day that will ever regret
The hours days years and the minutes
The joy the pain the sunshine and rain in it
The drives on the coast to nowhere
Nothing to say just sit and stare
There's nothing like the comfort of a silence that's comfortable
Not talking small just skip the bull
Then I find myself in servility
Didn't think that was my ability
I go a yard and a mile to make you smile
But then I'm happy see
I got so many ways to make your gaze elliptical
Got a ways to go future's so
Criptical and I'm glad
Just another many things we've had

It's 8: 16 A. M. Will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see
My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me
The day starts carefully
On the sidewalk with the dog
You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry
It's 73 degrees
January easily glides

Stranger flowers still
If you're gonna wanna go another day I will
Like this make it a deal
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a fell of impermanent bliss
Today my love we shall let the world slide
Turn off the ringer and just glide
For we shall never be youger again than
What do you see

It's 8: 16 A. M. Will you wake up to me
The first thing that you see
My eyes open I'm just hopin' you feel the same as me
The day starts carefully
On the sidewalk with the dog
You're right last night I was a hog
Come on I'm sorry
Holiday on the radio
Billie knows that is the way to go

A place where we both can spend out saved time
Not collecting interest
Maybe the same reason we always find ourselved home bound
I've got to do some homework
The leave response we want to leave Wisconsin
For a new life a new trailer with an antenna and a porch
Of course we'll bring the dog
