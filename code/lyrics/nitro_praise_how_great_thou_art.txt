Song:

Oh lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds thy hand have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art

Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art

And when I think, that God His son not sparing
Send him to die, I scarce can take it in.
That on the cross, my burdons gladly baring,
He bled died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art

Then sings my soul
My savior God to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
