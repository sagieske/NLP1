[Unk (talking)]
Yo so that's how it goes down
When I'm beatin down yo block
I here ya shawty
Ay this for all the hatas
Errbody who didn't think I was gonna make it
You know what I'm talkin bout
Errbody who was down wit me
All my friends all my family
From hood to hood
From my hood to yo hood
A-town stand up
Yo it's a brand new day
We gettin new money my n***a
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey

[Chorus:]
Ok now here we go slurpin on 24's
Blowin on ben and dro
Hey, Hey,
I came and stole the show
They thought thet I would blow
And now I get them every
Day, Day
I'm on the radio
I got that killa flow
Now everybody now my
Name, name, name, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse:]
Nobody in they life thought I'd go this far
My momma kept her face up so I persude as a star
Now when I say be real, my hope like now changed
It's money to the bank my lil girl got everythang
And now we movin up, like we seein George
I might of spent some s**t, I used to cut a ford
And yes I rock it all, dedications to my dogs
And all my friends that stayed down with yo boy man this for ya'll
I let the people see how it can be done
They watchin and soapin innerseptions so I run
Now stay up on yo grind, that's what the big man say
I told them is they vice, I'm shinnin everyday
Now they here my name like wait
I know that's dj unk
They fill me in they speakers, I'm bumpin in they trunk
I'm beatin down yo block, keep you bouncin in yo seat
Clap five times to my sound, dj Montay on the beat dj Montay on the beat

[Chorus:]
Hey, Hey
Ok now here we go slurpin on 24's
Blowin on ben and dro
Hey, Hey
I came and stole the show
They thought that I would blow
And now I get them every
Day, day
I'm on the radio
I got that killa flow
Now everybody now my
Name, name, name, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2:]
I'm dj unk be cool, be cool, calm, and steady
These n****s out here flexin, I told them they aint ready
Now what's the compatition, they square us just like frames
I barely here they songs I barely here they names
And I hold my head up high, Blowin kisses to the sky
R.I.P. Grandma Bell, love you grandma aint forgot
N***a now the world's gon see, how it's supposed to go
If ten was at the table five had to go
And that's just how it go, I saved it for the game
We bruoght it to the game, Big go baby do yo thang
Got diamonds on my neck, the neck match the ill, the ill match the watch,
The watch match the gear
Now this will be my year, before we let them burn
Put that in yo blunt and smoke it, you live and you learn
Now yo straight like a perm, I'm so strong as a bell
When my uncle walk come home we throwin 4's in the air throwin 4's everywere

[Chorus:]
Hey, Hey
Ok now here we go slurpin on 24's
Blowin on ben and dro
Hey, Hey
I came and stole the show
They thought that I would blow
And now I get them every
Day, Day
I'm on the radio
I got that killa flow
Now everybody now my
Name, name, name, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3:]
You see I'm on a mission, success is how it happens
Yo boy is Fredrick Doug, I sue wassup whats happenin
Before there's fingers snappin, You see I pay my dues
Every flier that you seen, dj unk on one's and two's
2000 is my crew, that's just a lil bit of my past
You see if you put me on, Big gon find me at last
I'm biddin it's a blast, I met up with the camp
Now gon and bring it back, I got the heart of a champ
These n****s said they vets, they only gettin slimmer
They lookin good for breakfast, I ate them up for dinner
I shoots them in they center, put some holes in yo tummy
I came threw bein hard, n****s froze like the money
The money started comming, the hoe's started shakin
They probably got the profit, the hatas started hatin
Some be congradualatin, I looks them died in they eye
Dj unk southern style, n***a reppers let it ride n***a reppers let it ride

[Chorus:]
Hey, Hey
Ok now here we go slurpin on 24's
Blowin on ben and dro
Hey, Hey
I came and stole the show
They thought that I would blow
And now I get them every
Day, Day
I'm on the radio
I got that killa flow
Now everybody now my
Name, name, name, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, Hey
Ok now here we go slurpin on 24's
Blowin on ben and dro
Hey, Hey
I came and stole the show
They thoght that I would blow
And now I get them every
Day, Day
I'm on the radio
I got that killa flow
Now everybody know my
Name, name, name, hey, hey, hey, hey
