Song:

Big picture slowly fades, walls are closing in,
And there I was cursing the ground, unable to understand.

I won't let the world break me, so I need to change direction.
Nothing special and far from perfect! Light the way for me.

(I won't say I'm sorry, I got what I deserve...)

Feel I was running an endless mile!
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside!
All of this will turn to ash, a change for a peace of mind.

Walking where the dead ships dwell,
These are shores I left behind.
Streets were getting smaller and I had to leave!

Feel I was running an endless mile!
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside!
All of this will turn to ash, a change for a peace of mind.

All I hear is noise, hearts of false hope.
Guess I took it for granted.
I know I went too far, I won't say I'm sorry.
I got what I deserve, I got what I deserve!

Feel I was running an endless mile!
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside!
All of this will turn to ash, a change for a peace of mind!

Feel I was running an endless mile!
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside!
All of this will turn to ash, a change for a peace of mind.
