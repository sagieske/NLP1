Song:

Bury me in f*****g Vegas!

Bury me in Vegas
Bury me in Vegas baby

I want s**, I want cars,
Want the drugs, grab the stars
Leave the past behind
With some drinks in those bars
Bling bling
I wear the biggest rolex baby
Lowride my car with slim shady

... Are. E. S. P. E. C. T"
Girls make me going crazy
Lipstick
High-heels
Do you wanna f**k me?

Take the money
Ride my c***
Bright light vegas-rock
I f****d Jenny from the block

Take me by the hand
Turn off the lights
This star shines bright
Through the darkest night
Take me tonight

Take me by the hand
Let's take a ride everything is possible tonight
Take me tonight

Wohoho!
Wohoho!
Bury me in Vegas baby! (x3)

Wohoho!
Wohoho!
Make your f*****g hands move!
Bury me in Vegas!

I'll take my money back
You f*****g s*** ruined me
F*****g Vegas the place where you're calling me

B***h!
W***e!
F**k you!

Knock knock who is there on the door?

Now crank the music up
'Cause this is party time
Cumshot-glass with-tequila and lime (x2)

Take me by the hand
Turn off the lights
This star shines bright
Through the darkest night
Take me tonight

Take me by the hand
Let's take a ride
Everything is possible tonight
Take me tonight

Wohoho!
Wohoho!
Bury me in vegas baby! (x4)
