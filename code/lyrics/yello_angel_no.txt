Song:

I don't wanna be your angel
I wanna be your witch
I gotta wait 'til the sun is down
I'm getting ready for another flight
Only if you're ready
And you're willing to drown
You can be mine tonight
I'm never ever gonna live reality
In the daylight
I'd never survive
I could never be your angel
Even if I tried

I don't wanna be your angel
I wanna be your witch

I don't wanna be your angel
I wanna be your witch

I don't wanna be your angel
I wanna be your witch
I gotta wait 'til the sun is down
I'm getting ready for another flight
Only if you're ready
And you're willing to drown
You can be mine tonight
I'm never ever gonna live reality
In the daylight
I'd never survive
I could never be your angel
Even if I tried
