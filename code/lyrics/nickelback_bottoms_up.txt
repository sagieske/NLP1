Song:

Hey!
Who's coming with me?
To kick a hole in the sky
I love the whiskey, let's drink that s**t till it's dry
So grab a Gym, B, J. B. Whatever you need
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me

Another round, fill 'er up
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up

(Hey, yeah!)

This is what it's all about
No one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out
Bottoms up
I can handle all of us
So get your bottles up
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out
Another round, fill 'er up
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up
Ohh, bottoms up

So grab your best friend
And make your way to the bar
But keep your distance
We're gonna light it on fire
We're drinking black tooth, 80 proof, straight gasoline
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me

Another round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!

(Hey, yeah!)

This is what it's all about
No one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out
Bottoms up
I can handle all of us
So get your bottles up
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out

Another round, fill 'er up,
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
Ohh, bottoms up...

(Solo)

This is what it's all about
No one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out
I can handle all of us
So get your bottles up
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out

This is what it's all about
No one can slow us down
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out
Bottoms up!
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out

'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!
