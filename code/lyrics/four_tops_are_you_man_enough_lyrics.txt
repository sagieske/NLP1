Song:

Are You Man Enough? -from the movie "Shaft in Africa" starring Richard Roundtree
---------------------------

There's not a street that you can walk.
You got to watch just who you're talkin' to.
They're out to get ya, can't turn your back on a smilin' face.
Next thing ya know, there ain't no trace of you.
And this I betcha... Some people lose, and some folks win.
It's a matter of what they do.

Are you man enough... Big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend.
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough... When the goin's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

There's no pretending it goes away.
With every step that you take... You pay your dues.
And I ain't lyin'.
You got to struggle to see the light.
How someone's lookin' to steal your right to choose.
And don't stop tryin'.
It's like a jungle outside the door,
And it's keepin' you so confused.

Are you man enough... Big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?

Gotta keep your eye on the passers-by.
Better watch your step!
'Cause ya never know where the knife will go,
And they ain't missed yet!
The strong survive, they stay alive,
They always cool,
But that they never teach you in school.

Are you man enough... Big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend.
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough... When the goin' get's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

Are you man enough... Big and bad enough? (Are you big & bad enough?)
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
