Song:

When you're on your own
And you feel lost
When your heart's a mess
Though you've given your best
I'll be here giving it my best shot baby
Your love's got all that I need
Here crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us if we believe
Here giving it my best shot
Baby I find that we can be free
When you're here with me

When your sky is dark
And the earth is shaking your bed
Your hope is at its end
You just need one friend
I'll be here giving it my best shot baby
Your love's got all that I need
Here crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us if we believe
Here giving it my best shot
Baby I find that we can be free
When you're here with me

When you can't find your way
And all around you water's deep and gray
The stars fall from above
And you're barely holding on my love
Giving it my best shot baby
Your love's got all that I need
Here crying from the rooftops
Nothing can stop us if we believe
Here giving it my best shot
Baby I find that we can be free
When you're here with me
