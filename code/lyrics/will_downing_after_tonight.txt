Song:

After tonight I’m gonna show you how to make love
After tonight I’ll be the only one you’re thinking of
After tonight I bet you’ll never be the same, love
After me loving you, after you loving me
After tonight, tonight, tonight

I can satisfy your every single need, love
Do everything your heart and mind’s been thinking of
Listen to every single word you have to say
I wanna know about you in every way

Baby, my mission tonight is to satisfy you
And, baby, we gon’ take this love and make it do what it do

‘Cause after tonight I’m gonna show you how to make love
After tonight I’ll be the only one you’re thinking of
After tonight I bet you’ll never be the same, love
After me loving you, after you loving me
After tonight, after tonight

My one and only desire is to please you
Fall on my knees and beg if I have to, baby
Give me a chance, I bet I’ll make you smile
I’ll make it last, baby, for a long while

Baby, my mission tonight is to satisfy you
And, baby, we gon’ take this love and make it do what it do

After tonight I’m gonna show you how to make love
After tonight I’ll be the only one you’re thinking of
After tonight I bet you’ll never be the same, love
‘Cause after me loving you, after you loving me
After tonight, after tonight

I’m gonna break it down, break it down
Down, down, down
I’m gonna break it down, break it down
Down, break it down

Let me break it down, break it down
Down, down, down
Let me break it down, break it down
Down, break it down

Baby, my mission tonight is to satisfy you
And, baby, we gon’ take this love and make it do what it do

‘Cause after tonight I’m gonna show you how to make love
After tonight I’ll be the only one you’re thinking of
After tonight I bet you’ll never be the same, love
After me loving you, after you loving me
After, after, after tonight

After tonight I’m gonna show you how to make love
After tonight I’ll be the only one you’re thinking of
After tonight I bet you’ll never be the same, love
After me loving you, after you loving me
After tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
