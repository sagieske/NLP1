Song:

I remember the palm trees swaying
Cross the river the sweet music playing, down on the Rio Grande
Out on the levee with the full moon above me
A Mexican lady, lord how she loved me, down on the Rio Grande
Laugh and singing in the warm night air
Loving that woman with the raven hair, we were down on the Rio Grande
Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be down on the Rio Grande

Endless highways and wide-open spaces
Children smile with their sun burned faces, down on the Rio Grande
All the love that my lady was giving
Was the sweetest part of living, down on the Rio Grande
And if these memories could take me there
I'd be loving my woman with the raven hair; I'd be down on the Rio Grande

Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be down on the Rio Grande, down on the Rio Grande
Strolling with my lover hand and hand
Lord I'd give anything to be down on the Rio Grande
Down on the Rio Grande
Down on the Rio Grande
