Song:

Lately you've been on my case
Well I'm sorry to find you in such a dreadful state
You see I'm not the kind of guy to hold ya down
If you got something else to say
I'm available Mondays to Fridays
You know where to find me

I got my head in the clouds
My two feet on the ground
Nothing's gonna move me
So whatcha trying to do, whatcha trying to say
You're acting funny when things start going my way
I got my heart on the line, still you wanna knock me
So what's this gonna prove
It's said how things turned out this way
But tomorrow's another day, another day for you

I can see you're just not happy
We all have our reasons
It could be just one of those days
Those days turn into months, you're left counting reasons
Did you ever think about the times we shared
Someday it'll hit you, you know where to run to
The question is will I be there, oh I'll be there

I got my head in the clouds
My two feet on the ground
Nothing's gonna move me
So whatcha trying to do, whatcha trying to say
You're acting funny when things start going my way
I got my heart on the line, still you wanna knock me
So what's this gonna prove
It's said how things turned out this way
But tomorrow's another day, another day

If I forever never ever never ever see you again
Be too good to be true but our worlds are one and the same
Power launches and parlour games
Some things never change
I don't know what the season will bring
Some things never change
I don't know if it'll ever be the same
Some things never change

I got my head in the clouds
Nothings going to move me
I got my heart on the line
Still you want to hurt me
I got my heart... Head.

Well this time you've gone too far
If I were you, I would walk away
But this time you've gone too far
If I were you, I would walk away
If I'm heading north
Your a** better be running south, walk away
But this time you've gone too far
If I were you I would just walk away
