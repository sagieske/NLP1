Song:

I'm driving down the highway
Cold and dark, dead
(It's deceiving)
It's deceiving
And miles and miles pass by
And I'm alone
My eyes feel like they're bleeding
But I'm just crying

Is this what I ask for?
Is this what I ask for?

I hate myself when I'm away from you
I swear I'm sorry
Please don't hate me too
And I don't know if my heart will make It through
I swear I'm sorry
Please don't hate me too

I don't suppose you heard me
Call your name, girl
If you say louder, 
Then I'll scream louder
The cities in between us block the way
They make it harder
But I'll scream louder

Is this what I ask for?
Is this what I ask for?

I hate myself when I'm away from you
I swear I'm sorry
Please don't hate me too
And I don't know if my heart will make
It through
I swear I'm sorry
Please don't hate me too

(Don't hate me)
Don't fail now
Hold on to hope
Cause I'm yours
I'm coming home to you soon
(I'm coming home)
Cause the road is very worn
And It's begging me to come back
(To You)

I hate myself when I'm away from you
I swear I'm sorry
(I'm sorry)
Please don't hate me too
(I'm coming home)
Don't hate me too
Please don't hate me too
