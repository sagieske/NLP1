Song:

Clone Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Hello Hello
Who wants the same
Hello Hello
Calling your name
Hello Hello
Stole your soul
Hello Hello
Making you whole

When you're here
I don't care
What you say
What you say to me
As long as you say it

Clone Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover
Clone
Hello Hello
You want to know
Hello Hello
Who's taking control

When you're here
I don't care
What you say
What you say to me
As long as you say it to me

Wish there was something I could do
Wish there was something else than you
Wish there was the same but new
Wish that I could be with you
