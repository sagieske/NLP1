[Lil' Jon]
Well get cho' hands up, get cho' hands up
Stop actin like a b***h and get cho' hands up
Well get cho' hands up, get cho' hands up

[Too $hort]
Well pour me some Bombay and fire up that bomb
It's about time somebody checked you, you b***h a** punk
I heard you slapped ya woman cause she told ya the truth
Real n****s, bring out the ho in you
Us pimp n****s get a foul ho, we chin check her
All you do is play the role n***a, you just an actor
Won't let a b***h breathe, if she wanted with your's
You just a weak m**********are, so insecure
How come she can't leave home without gettin' cussed out
Every time you get mad, you say get the f**k out
But I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
Come by the house and get nasty
I spit the real game
I rolled her in my Caddy when she yelled my name
I told her call me daddy
Trick n***a if you tell me you's a playa, you's a lie
Cause you'll never be like Willie Dynamite and Super-Fly
You just a...

[Chyna Whyte]
Bump, bump, bump, bump lettin' off shots
Double glock, glock, ch-ch, n***a pop pop
It don't stop in that Dirty South
Burn up this whole block, that's what this be about
N****s livin lawless, n****s labeled hardest
Gonna see who's life is shortest
Regaurdless this whole world to me is garbage
Tryin' to reap my harvest
I'm starvin' livin a life of ballin'
I'm still tryin' to find my callin'
And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow
I represent the slums, ate the crumbs
Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight
Hustlin' for food type
Who the dopest on the planet b***h, Chyna Whyte
