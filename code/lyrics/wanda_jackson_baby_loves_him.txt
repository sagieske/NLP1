Baby loves him
(Wanda Jackson)
" Â© '56 Combine Music "

Well, baby's a chick with the peroxide hair
You can't say this babe's a square
She likes her music with a solid beat
And when she starts to bop, you better go to your seat
'Cause, ooh, baby's gone
Yeah, she's gone a-all the way-ay, a-all the way
And when Baby fell, well, she really fell
Like I knew she would someday
Baby fell for a cat with the blue suede shoes
Drives a pink Cadillac and never sings the blues
They dance to a jukebox all night long
One glance and you'll say these cats are real gone
But, ooh, baby loves him
Yeah, she loves him a-all the way-ay, a-all the way
And when Baby fell, well, she really fell
Like I knew she would someday
Well, now they're the happiest kids in town
Baby's got his ring and she sports it all around
All the other gals are jealous as can be
But it's plain to see
Ooh, baby loves him
Yeah, she loves him a-all the way-ay, a-all the way
And when baby fell, well, she really fell
Like I knew she would someday
