Song:

Oh aint she sweet,
Well see her walking down that street.
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?

Oh aint she nice,
Well look her over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she nice?

Just cast an eye
In her direction.
Oh me oh my,
Aint that perfection?

Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?

Oh aint she sweet,
Well see her walking down that street.
Well I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?

Oh aint that nice,
Well look it over once or twice.
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she nice?

Just cast an eye
In her direction.
Oh me oh my,
Aint that perfection?

Oh I repeat
Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?

Oh aint she sweet,
Well see her walking down that street.
Well I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?
Well I ask you very confidentially:
Aint she sweet?
