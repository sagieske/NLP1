Romans 6: 18/Colossians 1: 13
To all who are tortured and ravaged by sin
The frail and the wounded about to give in
There's news of release and captivity's end
We've been set free, come and see
Oh sleeper awake, come out of the night
Throw open the door and step into the light
For sin is undone and the wrong is made right
We've been set free, come and see
Chorus
Come and see, the power of sin has been broken
The gates of your prisons stands open, come and see
Arise, believe, for the power at work both to rescue and save
Is the power that raised Jesus Christ from the grave
We've been set free, come and see
I, too, lived in slavery, unmercifully bound
Battered and broken I finally knelt down
And there in obedience freedom was found, I've been set free
And now through the dungeons of darkness and night
I run in the freedom of liberty's light
And shout to the captives, "Oh prisoners take flight
We've been set free, come and see"
Chorus
If the enemy's holding a knife to your chest
Demanding you give up or die
In Christ crucified you've already died
And now you are free
Chorus
