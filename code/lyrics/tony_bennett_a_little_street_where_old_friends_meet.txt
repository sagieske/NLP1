Song:

It's just a little street where old friends meet
I'd love to wander back someday
To you, it may be old and sort of tumbled down
But it means a lot to folks in my hometown

Although I'm rich or poor, I still feel sure
I'm welcome as the flowers in May
It's just a little street where old friends meet
And treat you in the same old way

Although I'm rich or poor, I still feel sure
I'm welcome as the flowers in May
It's just a little street where old friends meet
And treat you in the same old way

It's not fashion street or even easy street
It's just a little street where old friends meet
