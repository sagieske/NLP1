Song:

I don't wanna be your Monday morning
Headed back to work, stuck in traffic
Going slow, nothing on the radio
I don't want to be another chore to check
Off your list of things you gotta to do
And places that you gotta go

Oh, no

I want to be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I want to be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I want to set you free, I want to take you high
I want to be, want to be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

We can rock together, let the good times
Roll forever, fill up our cup
Make a memory, drink it up
I don't want to miss another minute,
Want to live it with you 'neath the blue sky
Fallin' in love

I want to be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I want to be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I want to set you free, I want to take you high
I want to be, want to be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

I want to be your lemonade in the shade
Money in your pocket 'cause you just got paid, babe

I want to be your Friday night sweet ride
Summertime, sunshine, barefoot in the moonlight
I want to be your jackpot hot spot
Wide open road in a candy apple rag top
I want to set you free, I want to take you high
I want to be, want to be your Friday night
Oh, your Friday night

Hey, your Friday night
Your Friday night
Friday night
Friday night
