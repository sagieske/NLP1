Song:

Hey now Buddy don't u worry about it too long
You won't start winning 'til you tell her there's something wrong
You'll feel a lot better if you hold it together
And sing a different song

You could be better on your own
You could be better if you let her go
You could be better on your own
You could be better if you just said no

Hey now honey don't you worry about it too long
He wont start singing 'til you tell just were your coming from
You'll feel a lot better if you hold it together
And hope he sings along

You could be better on your own
You could be better if you let him go
You could be better on your own
You could be better if you just said no

You could be better on your own now
You gotta love yourself now
You gotta love yourself yeah

You could be better on your own
You could be better if you let her go
You could be better on your own
You could be better if you just said no

You could be better on your own
You could be better if you let her go
You could be better on your own
You could be better if you just said no

You could be better on your own
