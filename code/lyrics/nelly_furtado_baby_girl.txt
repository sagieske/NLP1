Song:

I've seen a man cry, I've seen a man die inside
I've seen him say to me that he is only mine
That he gotta do what is best for him
Never let me in, not even begin
To tell me I'm the one under his moon and sun
That I am the thing that revolves around him
But while on top of him I know what's best for him
I'll show him how to win and let me in 'cause

I don't wanna be your baby girl
I don't wanna be your little pearl
I just wanna be what's best for me
To be one-da-dum with my own star under my own sun

We're all sorry now, I didn't mean to wow
Make you cry like that, it's just a little spat
Still I want you to know, though I love you so
It's mostly me dreaming, forcing, believing
That you're an ideal, hell I never steal
But I stole you from, from another one
So take yourself and wrap around my little finger
'cause that's how it should swing

I don't wanna be your baby girl
I don't wanna be your little pearl
I just wanna be what's best for me
To be one-da-dum with my own star under my own sun

Why can't he see, why can't he see what's inside of me, yeah... Don't you, don't you call me coochie-coo a little girl, now... Don't you gaga goo no coochie-coo girl now I'm so much more, can't you see? Can't you see?
Look who's writing now a token of their love
Can't you see love that it's just because
I wanted a cheap way to get inside your head
And not a cheap way to get inside your bed
Oh you're running now, with that silly one
It's all over now, this woman's just begun
Maybe we'll see about the will and the way
Butterflies return some day

I don't wanna be your baby girl
I don't wanna be your little pearl
I just wanna be what's best for me
To be one-da-dum with my own star under my own sun
