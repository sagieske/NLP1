Song:

[Chorus]
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone

One day you gonn wake up thinking
How you ain’t noticed
Now you see me, now you don’t, hocus pocus
Had your chance, let it pass, now you out of focus
All you got up in your hand is a bunch of jokers
Cause they ain’t me, baby believe me
I’m just what you needed
And I know it’s gotta sting baby
You done left the king
Don’t you hate to see me win?

[Chorus]
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone

One day you gonn wake up thinking
How you ain’t noticed
Now you see me, now you don’t, hocus pocus
Had your chance, let it pass, now you out of focus
All you got up in your hand is a bunch of jokers
Cause they ain’t me, baby believe me
I’m just what you needed
And I know it’s gotta sting baby
You done left the king
Don’t you hate to see me win?

[Chorus] x 2
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone
I bet you miss me now, I bet you miss me now
You could have had it all
But now it’s all gone.
