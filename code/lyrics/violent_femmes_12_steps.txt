Song:

I think I'm powerless over this.
Only a power greater than me
Could store my synergy.

I took my will into no will but thy will.
Made a moral inventory of my moral story.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

I was wrong, I say to myself.
And I say to everybody else.
My character needs a caretaker.
Under God.
Who would remove my shortcomings and my highgoings.
I made a list of everyone I dissed and pissed on.
And I will make amends to correct this.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

T-W-E-L-V-E S-T-E-P-S

I will do it directly unless this causes injury.
I will admit to be full of shit as soon as I'm aware of it.
Seek through prayer and meditation to keep God in communication.
Now my spirit is week, I say wake up in love and go to sleep in hate.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

I am getting powerless over this.
I have become powerless over this.
I have become powerless over this.
