Song:

There's another world inside of me
That you may never see,
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide.
Well, somewhere in this darkness,
There's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away,
Maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind,

Chorus

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
And love me when I'm gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I'll never let you down,
Even if I could,
Give up everything,
If only for your good,

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
You won't always be there,
So love me when I'm gone.
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone...

Refrain

When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin,
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends.
Now roaming through this darkness,
I'm alive but I'm alone,
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone.

Chorus

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
And love me when I'm gone.

Everything I am,
And everything in me,
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be.
I'll never let you down,
Even if I could,
Give up everything,
If only for your good,

So hold me when I'm here,
Right me when I'm wrong,
Hold me when I'm scared,
You won't always be there,
So love me when I'm gone.

Maybe I'm just blind.

Chorus
