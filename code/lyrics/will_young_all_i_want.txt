Song:

So slow, I can't see how you live in fear of life

[Chorus]
Baby what a day, baby what a day under these skies, it ain't over
All I want is to get you on your own somehow
If you're one of those then you're one of those, make up your mind
'cause it's working
All I know is I'll get you on your own somehow
See now I choose your smile, is cheer uncool in life?

[Chorus]

Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need
Say what you got and you say what you need

See how, I can, you comfort me

[Chorus]
