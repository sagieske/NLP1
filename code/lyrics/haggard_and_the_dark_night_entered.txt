Song:

And Michael Nostradamus began to wander
Through Europe for the next sixyears, where
He first became aware the awakening of
His prophetic powers

So god has found him weeping
And weath flickered deep withis his eyes
For thy shalt suffer
As long ago...

Sadness comes from deep inside
There are so many shades of winter
His breath warms up the wintry air
Punishment to all the sinners

Demenia slowly unlightnes the mind...

So god has found him weeping
And wrath flickered deep withis his eyes
For thy shalt suffer
As long ago...

Your wish shalt be denied...
So do you hear the echoes of the ones that'll slowly die?
Prophecy fulfilled
And torture comes at midnight
A dark sign's burning brighter than the light

So do you hear the echoes...?

Out beneath the nightly sky
Squat down on the ground
His breath warms up the wintry air
The truth hurts, that he found

He might be the chisen one
The one, allowed to see
God's eye for the human race
That ends in misery

Nobody knows...
That it is real, nobody knows... That it is real!
