Song:

So just shut up and be mine
Don't wait a little more
It comes with no voice, It's a love that goes
I'm afraid that it will disappear
So just shut up and be mine
Come here in front of me
Don't hesitate, take my hand at this moment
We'll make it through anything, you're the one I bet
So just shut up than be mine
Don't wait a little more
It comes with no voice, It's a love that goes
I'm afraid that it will disappear
