Song:

The way I feel
Whenever I think about you
May be just a fantasy
But when you're near
The look in your eyes can tell me
May be just my destiny
And I can't hide it anymore
The way you make me feel inside
The reason why I'm here tonight
Is just to tell you girl
[Chorus:]
If you need me to touch and to hold you
Baby call my name
If you want me to say that I love you
Baby call my name
(Repeat)
You tell me now
That you talk, but I never listen
May be just a mystery
I hear them say
That the distance can bring us closer
May be just reality
And I can't hide it anymore
The way you make me feel inside
The reason why I'm here tonight
Is just to tell you girl
[Chorus:]
If you need me to touch and to hold you
Baby call my name
If you want me to say that I love you
Baby call my name
(Repeat
