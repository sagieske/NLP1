Mai-ha-hi
Mai-ha-hu
Mai-ha-ha
Mai-ha-ha-ha (x2)

Hallo, Hey
It's me, an outlaw
And please, my love, accept the happiness
Hallo, Hallo, it's me, Picasso
I've beeped you and I am tough
But know I don't ask you anything

You want to leave but don't take me, don't take me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Your face and the love from the Linden tree
Remind me of your eyes (x2)

I call you, to tell you
What I feel now
Hallo, my love, it's me, the happiness
Hallo, Hallo, it's me again, Picasso
I've beeped you and I am tough
But know I don't ask you anything

You want to leave but don't take me, don't take me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Your face and the love from the Linden tree
Remind me of your eyes (x2)

Mai-ha-hi
Mai-ha-hu
Mai-ha-ha
Mai-ha-ha-ha (x2)

You want to leave but don't take me, don't take me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Don't (take) me, don't (take) me, don't (take) me with you
Your face and the love from the Linden tree
Remind me of your eyes (x2)
