Song:

Sweet child in time you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and the bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, taking toll
If you've been bad, lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

I wanna hear you scream

Sweet child in time you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between, good and the bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, taking toll
If you've been bad, lord I bet you have
And you've not been hit by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

I gotta hear you scream

Oh, god, oh, no don't, oh, ain't gonna do it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no
