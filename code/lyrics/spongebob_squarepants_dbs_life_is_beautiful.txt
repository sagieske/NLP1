Song:

Every morning, I feel the breeze
The sun washes over me..
The sound of water, the crashing sea
Is it only me..that feels alive
Its all ahead on me

'Cause it feels so right..
Jus open your eyes and see that..

Chorus: Life is beautiful [so beautiful]
So beautiful to me
Life can take you anywhere
You don't know where it leads you
But you know you're not alone
Just open your eyes and see that..
