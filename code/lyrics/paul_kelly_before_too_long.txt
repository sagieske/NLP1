Song:

Before too long
The one that you're loving
Will wish that he'd never met you
Before too long
He who is nothing
Will suddenly come into view
So let the time keep rolling on
It's on my side
Lonely nights will soon be gone
High is the tide
Before too long
We'll be together
And no-one will tear us apart
Before too long
The words will be spoken
I know all the action by heart
As the night time follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Shut the shade do no fear anymore
Here I come creeping round your back door
Before too long
I'll be repeating
What's happened before in my mind
Before too long
Over and over
Just like a hammer inside
As the nighttime follows day
I'm closing in
Every dog will have his day
Any dog can win
Before too long
Before too long
