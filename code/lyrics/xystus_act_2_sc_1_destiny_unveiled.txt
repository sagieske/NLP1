Song:

[Diegu:]
I've seen your face,
Inside my dreams
You're haunting me

[Lady Sophia:]
Your path in life has led you here:
To where you stand
I am the presence in your head,
Lighting the way

[Diegu:]
I recall your voice,
It soothed me all these years
Tell me what you are
Please tell me
Why I'm here - with you

[Lady Sophia:]
I am all of that
Which isn't shaped by it's past
Now all you need, is what I'll be
Sophia - your friend

[Diegu:]
Many years ago...
I died of a disease
Someone has brought me back to life
Do I owe you my life?

[Lady Sophia:]
Look into my eyes
With tears they overflow
And you're my only hope

[Diegu:]
I see her fall onto her knees
My destiny's unveiled:
"The one who'll save us all"

[Lady Sophia:]
As the weight drops down
And his face turns white
He realizes:

[Diegu:]
I am all there is
And all this time...
How can I be he who'll save us all?
Why should I be the one?
This cannot be... No - this cannot be!

[Lady Sophia:]
Diegu - remember your death
You died... I brought you back to life
I ask you: please fulfill this task
Your path in life has led you here:
To where you stand
Now that your destiny's unveiled
Do what you can...

[Diegu:]
No matter what I say
This task will lead my way
Your world won't cease to be
This burden is fit for me -
So it seems...

[Lady Sophia:]
Look into my eyes
With tears they overflow
And you're my only hope

[Diegu:]
I see her fall onto her knees
My destiny's unveiled:
"The one who'll save us all"

[Lady Sophia:]
As the weight drops down
And his face turns white
He realizes:

[Diegu:]
I am all there is

[Lady Sophia:]
Oh... My Diegu, you I trust in
Oh... My Diegu, don't fail me
