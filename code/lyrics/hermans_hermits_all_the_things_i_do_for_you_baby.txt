Song:

1) I leave the house every morning at eight
And I work pretty hard for the money I made
But it's clear to see - You don't appreciate
All the things, that I did for You, baby

2) Well, You want some of these, or You want some of those
The more money I make, the faster it goes
And You don't say - thanks for those new pretty clothes
And all the things I do for You, baby

------ Lead Guitar ------

Chorus: Why can't You see
Just what You're doing to me
Baby, it's true -
All what I'm doing, I'm doing for You

3) Maybe You think 'cos I work with my hands
That I'm not as smart as some of the men
But I pray every night, that You'll understand -
All the things I do for You, baby

------ Lead Guitar ------

Chorus: Why can't You see
Just what You're doing to me
Baby, it's true -
All what I'm doing, I'm doing for You

4) When I'm in need of somebody to hold
One caress when I'm feeling cold
You can't afford to tell me no
With all the things I do for You, baby
With all the things I do for You, baby
