Song:

Have we lost the spark or a guide?
What's the latest on the screen?
Can't be too late to turn around
I need all the help from you
I need to find something to blame for a long lost time

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

Is it dark or is it bright?
What's the latest on the screen?
Please tell me my name,
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something, I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go?
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today, there are only a few
The sign of times my friend

Avoid infinity?
Are you for real?
Just scratch the surface, and you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today, there are only a few
The sign of times my friend

(instrumental)

Just scratch the surface, and you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today, there are only a few
The sign of times my friend.

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone?
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today, there are only a few

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today, there are only a few
