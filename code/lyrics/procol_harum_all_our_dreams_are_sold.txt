Song:

(g. Brooker / K. Reid / are. Trower)

Rings upon your fingers
Bells upon your toes
Ev'ry day's a game of chance
Ev'ry body knows
In the king's apartment
Heavy lies the crown
There must be a thousand ways
To bring that castle down

Wave the mighty dollar
Make us live again
Lead and we will follow
Faithful to the end
Wave the mighty dollar
Pave the streets with gold
Lead us by the collar
All our dreams are sold

Rings upon your finger
Stardust in your hair
Jumping through that wall of fire
All for the market share
In the king's apartment
Desperate human greed
Try to find a diff'rent way
Satisfy that need

Wave the mighty dollar
Make us live again
Lead and we will follow
Faithful to the end
Wave the mighty dollar
Pave the streets with gold
Lead us by the collar
All our dreams are sold
