Song:

Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang
When we?
You love the way you throw now
Throw now, throw now
The way you throw now

Roll up in your love like a drum box
Doing it hard away
Hold on baby, like I'm gonna die
Laying in this spell like a pet shop
Love the way you give it to me grid lock
And I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what anybody thinks buy
When I'm with you I don't think about
We go on and on and on
To this all night long, night long, night long
In my zone, my zone, my zone, my zone
We just let it bang!

Underneath the covers, not colors, just lovers
Throw it all, throw it all,
Baby just hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Let the air throw down, throw down, throw down
We just let it bang, we just let it bang
Throw it all, throw it all,
Baby just hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Let the air throw down, throw down, throw down
We just let it bang, we just let it bang

It seems like we're now getting initiated
'Cause the thing is all initiated
I'm your body like day light
I know your body like good night
Go ahead, sweat it all, sweat it all
Go ahead, sweat it all

We go on and on and on
To this all night long, night long, night long
In my zone, my zone, my zone, my zone
We just let it bang

Underneath the covers, not colors, just lovers
Throw it all, throw it all,
Baby just hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Let the air throw down, throw down, throw down
We just let it bang, we just let it bang
Throw it all, throw it all,
Baby just hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Let the air throw down, throw down, throw down
We just let it bang, we just let it bang

Baby I got love you on my mind
And I tell you all the mind
You've been gone I need retribution
And your love is my resolution
I wanna feel you in my spirit
I wish everybody could feel this
Everybody but god should feel this, feel this

Throw it all, throw it all,
Baby just hold it up, hold it up, hold it up
Let the air throw down, throw down, throw down
We just let it bang, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
Bang
