Song:

1) What would you say if I called your name
Sailing in space spinning in clouds far above the ground
Searching the sky it's a mystery
Passing through colors, colors and light
And the world it welcomes me in with arms and eyes

Chorus -
Help me cause I'm falling
And I'm feeling like I'm never gonna hit the ground

2) Dream lit sky flows into the night
Clouds rush through, through my mind and the world is spinning in time
What would you say if we felt the sky
Flow through our hair and the clouds float by
Dreamers sifting their souls through heavens eyes

Chorus
