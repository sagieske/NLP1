Song:

I went to a party the other night
They said it' s gonna be right there
But when we were in the party
I was disappointed yeah
All we could hear there was their crackadoo
All we could hear there was their
Shoobee doobee yeah
And the music they played there
Was not good for a rasta man yeah
It was not good for a Jah man

Chorus: (x3)
I' m going back to my roots yeah yeah
Reggae music is all that I need

All we could hear there was their crackadoo
All we could hear there was their
Shoobee doobee yeah
And the music they played there
Was not good for a rasta man
It was not good for a Jah man

Chorus: (x2)

Reggae is mine reggae is mine yeah yeah
Reggae is mine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(fade)

Chorus till fade
