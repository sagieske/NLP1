Song:

Its late enough to go drivin
And see what's mine
That's a study of dying
How to do it right
Youre a holy roller
Get your bed in the loose
If you're hanging around
I'm holdin the noose

Come a little bit closer
And get on tight
In a hurse rollin over
Just a track in the line
F**k it

Come on, lets go drivin
Come on, lets take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right
