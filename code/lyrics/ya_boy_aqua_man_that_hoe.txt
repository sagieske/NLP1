Ya Boy
Eh you know like when you be in the club
And you see that b***h like, like

Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
Get her wet (crank dat new Ya Boy) [x4]

New Ya Boy off in this ho
B***h I'm leanin' off that 'dro
Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
Get her wet (crank dat new Ya Boy) [x4]

Girl, Ya Boy off in this thing
Shot it like a mutherfuckin' pinky ring
Me and those guys are not the same
Look my brain just hydroplane
Just get it off in a whole 'nother lane
Just like be in that brand new Range
All red fit, red candy paint
Gun make you jump around, house of pain
Ma, got your clothes on, take them off
Don't want to f**k, just want that mouth
Too much teeth, ooh watch that, ouch
B***h get off me, go sleep on the couch
The Game had a claim, it's bmg
Shout out the term ap and bd
Flow's so real see it in 3D
Realest n***a ever to grace a cd

New Ya Boy off in this ho
B***h I'm leanin' off that 'dro
Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
Get her wet (crank dat new Ya Boy) [x4]
I said
New Ya Boy off in this ho
B***h I'm leanin' off that 'dro
Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
Get her wet (crank dat new Ya Boy) [x4]

Shoot up n****s, I get her wet
Plus I got a flow she can't forget
I give it to her, her and then her next
Rough s** damn near break her neck
Got her hooked on the d**k when she wrote my check
My dicks bigger than yours I bet
This why be I so project
Shake a b***h up like Etch-a-Sketch
Do a b***h now like girl who next
And Aquaman that hoe, she wet
I get green call me Kermit
Never come out the game like, uh her met
Yes, yes, I am the best
If you want to test don't need that vest
Have a red beam all over that chest
Corner team all over that mess like

New Ya Boy off in this ho
B***h I'm leanin' off that 'dro
Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
Get her wet (crank dat new Ya Boy) [x4]
I said
New Ya Boy off in this ho
B***h I'm leanin' off that 'dro
Get that girl up out her clothes and
Aquaman that ho
