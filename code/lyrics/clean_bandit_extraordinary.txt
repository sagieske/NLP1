Song:

[Verse:]
You can see there's something in the way
I've tried to show you, my door is open
I don't know how much more I can take
Since you've chosen to leave me frozen
Am I the only one who sees what you've become?
Will you drift away?
We're running out of time, two words can make it right
Could I make you stay?

People making choices, they can't fake
Sacrifice it all and baby say

[Chorus:]
Something extraordinary, something real
To fill my days and nights with something that I can feel
I'm not gonna compromise, surely you can simplify?
Say you feel the same?

[Verse 2:]
You've wandered down a path I can't explain
Have you seen her? The grass is greener
To let me pass you by would be a shame
If she's your only, then why are you only?
Cause I'm the only one who knows the things you've done
I'm so good for you
We're running out of time, two words can make it right
Could I make you do?

[Chorus:]
Something extraordinary, something real
To fill my days and nights with something that I can feel
I'm not gonna compromise, surely you can simplify?
Say you feel the same?

[Bridge:]
Just don't say it'll be alright
You're not holding yourself in your arms tonight
Don't say it will all be fine
In only a moment you'll say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Something extraordinary, something real
To fill my days and nights with something that I can feel

[Bridge:]
