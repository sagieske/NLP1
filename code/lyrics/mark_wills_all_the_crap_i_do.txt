Song:

All the crap I do, I don't know why
My demons fight my angels and beat 'em every time
I'm just a man, the same old stupid fool
Still trying to make sense of all the crap I do

When you need a door I'm a wall
I never say I'm sorry fast enough when it's my fault
I'm too damn proud, stubborn as a mule
'Cause I've tried a thousand times to quit the crap I do

Broken promise should be my middle name
But baby if you only knew
How much I wish I could find a way to change
And make it easier on you
Lord, I'd love to make it easier on you

'Cause all the crap I do makes me hard to love
But every time I let you down, girl you don't give up
You give me your heart when you should give me the boot
And you keep on loving on through all the crap I do

Broken promise should be my middle name
'Cause baby if you only knew
How much I wish I could find a way to change
And make it easier on you
Lord, I'd love to make it easier on you

'Cause all the crap I do that makes you cry
Through all the worry and the lonely and sleepless nights
I know it ain't much but this song's for you
'Cause you keep on loving on through all the crap I do
Yeah, you keep on loving on through all the crap I do
