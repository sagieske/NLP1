Song:

They say that in war
That truth
Be the first casualty
So I dig in selector
I the resurrector
Fly my s**t
Sever your neck
Wider than ever
With my tongue
Dipped in funk arsenic
Burn this illusion
This lie
This straight arson s**t
Your arsenal stripped
Power ain't full jackets
And clips
It's my ability
To define phenomenon
Raw Crenshaw '84
Boogie down before
L. A.
When the war break off
Where you be take off
Stand in full face off
With the M1 millimeter
Let the rhythm
Of the chamber hit 'em
Let the rich play
Catch with 'em
Better yet make 'em eat
'Em and s**t 'em
Till they
So full of holes
That they drown
In their own
I'm like a nail stuck
In the wrist
Of they Christmas
Don't need radio
To leave their family
A witness

Muhammad
And Christ would life
Would lay
Your body down
To a tune
So wild international
In the desert
Full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome
With my verse
With my body rock

In this era
Where djs behave
Be paid to be slaves
We raid airwaves
To be sane
And what's raining
From the station
Cash fascination
Like living dead
Fed agents
Distract us fast
From a disaster's
Wrath for sure
Air war was flooded
Like the 9th ward
On the am, on the am
Turn and face them
Hatred and mayhem
Slay them, dangerous
I take razor steps
It's the swing
From the bling
To the bang on the left
It's the murderous return
Boom back full strap
Your six
That got clipped
You can't clap back
With minimal lift
And criminal flow
I'm killing them soft
And billing them for
Everything stole
And once again
I'm that nail
In the wrist
Of they Christmas
Watch me
Make their family
A witness

Muhammad
And Christ would life
Would lay
Your body down
To a tune
So wild international
In the desert
Full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome
With my verse
With my body rock

Muhammad
And Christ would life
Would lay
Your body down
To a tune
So wild international
In the desert
Full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome
With my verse
With my body rock

International
International

Muhammad
And Christ would life
Would lay
Your body down
To a tune
So wild international
In the desert
Full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome
With my verse
With my body rock

Muhammad
And Christ would life
Would lay
Your body down
To a tune
So wild international
In the desert
Full of bullets
Let your body rot
With my chrome
With my verse
With my body rock
