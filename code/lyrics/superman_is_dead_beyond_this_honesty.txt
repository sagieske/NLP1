Song:

When I found the love it's seem so hard,
To make it close here in my heart
Break the single day out of my time,
But then the good things never come
Oh feel my heart,
It's gonna blow by one two three
But I got nothing much to lose
Send back the dime,
Won't ease the pain cause I got mine
Yea I got my own misery

So I'll say what I say,
And do what I do, and I will be true,
Beyond this honesty

Oh, I thought the angel will be you
Oh, now you spit fire on my face
Oh, you start to talk like you're god
Oh, you put the stupid music on
(Oh what the f**k!)

All the joke that used to make me laugh,
Now it's just dumb you said it too much
All the beauty came out from your face,
It doesn't scratch my eyes again

Hi what's your name,
Can I kiss your lips, baby I love you
Wish I didn't speak those words to you
Now I realize that you try so hard
Always put me down,
Hey baby this man had enough

So just say what you say,
And do what you do, It won't be for long
Beyond this honesty

Oh, she bring me down about my style
Oh, why don't you burn like a Barbie doll
Oh, she likes the macho kind a guy
Oh, no wonder she act like one too
(Oh what the f**k!)
