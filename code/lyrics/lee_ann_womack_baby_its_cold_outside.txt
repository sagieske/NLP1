Song:

I really can't stay (baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go 'way (baby, it's cold outside)
The evening has been (I've been hopin' that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hand, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (hey beautiful, what's your hurry)
And father will be pacing the floor (listen to that fireplace roar)
So really, I'd better scurry (beautiful, please don't hurry)
Well, maybe just a half a drink more (put some music on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink (no cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I oughtta say no, no, no sir (you mind if I move in closer)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (and what's the sense in hurting my pride)
I really can't stay (oh baby, don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go (it's cold outside)
The answer is no (baby, it's cold outside)
The welcome has been (so lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at that storm)

My sister will be suspicious (your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (I ain't worried about you brother)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (that ol' biddy, she ain't gonna bother me)
Well maybe just a cigarette more (you don't need no cigarette, it's smokin' plenty up in here)

I've got to get home (baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me a comb (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
Oh, but don't you see (how can you do this thing to me)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (well, think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (get over that hold out)
Oh, but baby it's cold outside
