Song:

She’s my black pearl
She’s my Black pearl

I don’t need a map my heart points me to you
Even if the road ahead is rough I can’t do this where I stand
There wasn’t a moment we were apart or when I forgot about you
If only I can see you at the end of the horizon

I raise the masts and I’m carried by the wind oh
Put the water’s roughening surface to sleep

Flower that bloomed in the dark, the moon above the sea
A place like a secret, my beautiful black pearl
Flower that bloomed in the dark, the moon above the sea
A place like a secret, my beautiful black pearl

Question of existence, apart from reality
Am I wandering in a dream and what’s beyond it

My goddess, oh, who looks as though she lives inside a myth
I fight past the time to find you
I’ve never believed in things that are forever
If I may reach you whom I’ve been wanting so desperately

I raise the masts and I’m carried by the wind oh
Put the water’s roughening surface to sleep

Flower that bloomed in the dark, the moon above the sea
A place like a secret, my beautiful black pearl
Flower that bloomed in the dark, the moon above the sea
A place like a secret, my beautiful black pearl

Even at the dizzying moment as the storm rages
Don’t turn the boat around, don’t stop sailing
If I knew I’d go back cowering at this level of peril I wouldn’t have started in the first place
I face the sea that stole you away to play games with m

Put the water’s roughening surface to sleep x3
She’s my black pearl oh- She is my black pearl
I’m the five oceans that are in the sky with the sun
Towards her shining brilliantly

My beautiful black pearl that reflects dimly above the high tides in the thick mist
(Ho- oh- my beautiful black pearl yeah)
My beautiful black pearl that can be faintly heard above the melancholy tune in the deep silence
(Ho- hey she’s my beautiful beautiful black pearl)
