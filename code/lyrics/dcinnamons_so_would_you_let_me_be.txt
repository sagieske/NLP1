Song:

We've get along together
I should have known
You're the best that I can love
Till now it's hard for me to face it
Why didn't we meet each other soon

I left them all behind you, only for you
Would you believe me
I put my trust on you
But deep inside I realize
That I can't, no I can't

They were all my brother
My cry and happiness

*
So would you let me be myself
Reach all my my dreams and hopes
I know you've known me better
I know you love me, you do

Your eyes says more than anything
That really means to me
So darling would you now
Would you set me free
