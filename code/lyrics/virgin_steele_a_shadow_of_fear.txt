Song:

[The godhead:]
Black Cypress falling, cold winter snow
What are you asking, what should you know? ??
Gods of Deliverance bleeding in shame
Don't pierce the Heavens lest you remain Divine. ..
Divine. ..

[Endyamon:]
Rise with the challenge, fortune and fame
All that lies bleeding, tortured and chained Gods of Deliverance,
Black Stars align All that you live for dies on the vine
[The gods:]
Rise on the Wind at the top of the
Gate We delight in your torment, fortune and Fate for we know. ..
[Humanity:]
We wander the Desert, the ice and the snow
Remember the Future is not what you're sold
The Gods of Deliverance, the Black Stars align
The only Survivors are whipped in the spine for we know. ..
Yes we know. ..
[Endyamon:]
Rise with the Goddess, fortune is dead
All that you hope for bleeding instead
Gods of Deliverance searching in vain
Every last hour marks off your reign
[The gods:]
Rise like the Wind at the top of the
World We delight in your torture, fortune and Fate for we know. ..
[Humanity:]
We wander the Desert, the ice and the snow
Remember the Future is not what we're told
The Gods of Deliverance, the Black Stars align
The only Survivors our World is unkind for we know. ..
Victims of the World! !!
[Endyamon / We wander the Desert, the ice and the snow humanity:]
Remember the Future is not what we're told
The Gods of Deliverance, the Black Stars align
The only Survivors are killed in their prime for we know. ..
We already know. ..
We already know. ..
Already know. ..
[Endyamon to Black Cypress falling, cold winter snow emalaith:]
All that you hope for hidden and sold Cries on the Tempest,
I can't feel your eyes. ..
