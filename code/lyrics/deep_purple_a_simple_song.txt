Song:

Time, it does not matter
But time is all we have
To think about, think about

Road, it has no end
Crossroads every turn
So it goes, so it goes

Once you sang
A simple song
Got confused
Went on too long

Why does the promise fade
You lie on the bed you make

Stranger than fiction
Further from the truth
Beyond imagination
Those seeds have taken root"

Wild as a dream could be

From black and white
To blue and red
Golden circles
Flow above your head

Once you sang
A simple song
You got confused
And now itâ€™s gone

Once you sang
A simple song
It all went wrong

Time, it does not matter
Time is all we have
