Song:

I open my eyes, only to see
Just how sad this world could be
That I often cry alone... Ohh

I look at the sky, longing to see
There's a chance out there for me
For my heart to be set free

[Refrain]
My friends had say that it's ok
When rainbow's fade in clouds of gray
But in my heart I know someday
True happiness will come my way

[Chorus:]
I never knew love till I found you
There's magic in your smile
Never knew love till I saw you lookin' in my eyes
And suddenly our sadness disappears
True love has fin'lly shown it's smilin' eyes on me

I'm searching the skies hopin' to see
If there's someone out there for me
Who will set my poor heart free

[Repeat refrain]

[Repeat chorus]

I once believe that love was just a fairytale
But each time you hold me
Those fairytales come true... On you

[Repeat chorus]
