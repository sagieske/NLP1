Song:

Can't fight this feeling
Morning rain is all the same
You know, you know,
Falling out of the sealing
Fall, fall, fall,
Falling in and out of love
You know, you know,
When you can't fight the feeling
Always the same morning rain
You know, you know,
Falling out of the sealing
They all fall out your heart
Someone's always on the run
Everybody's on the run
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Everybody's on the run x4

Can't fight the feeling
Always the same morning rain
You know, you know,
Coming out of the sealing
All inside your heart
Everybody's on the run x 2
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Everybody's on the run
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
Everybody's on the run x 4

Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love
Hang in there love
You gotta hold on
You gotta be strong enough for love
Everybody's on the run x 4
