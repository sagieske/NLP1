Song:

Always looking over your shoulder
As if the past would tell you who you are.
Do you think the answer's farther
Than your wishing star?
You don't have to feel this way.

What a shame to be walking along
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
You've been stuck in this game.
You've been down for so long,
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Baby come on.

So scared to change what you believe in.
You've always seen the world so gray.
Sometimes you get a different feeling,
When you look at things in the light of the day.
When the world don't seem so strange.

What a shame to be walking along
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
You've been stuck in this game.
You've been down for so long,
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Baby come on.

You gotta believe me.
Baby come on.
Don't look away.
Baby come on.
It could be easy.
Cause when I look at you the way I do I know you'll be ok.

What a shame to be walking along
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
You've been stuck in this game.
You've been down for so long,
Thinking nothing is right, when nothing is wrong.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
And it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Baby come on.
