Song:

As I stand here this evening,
Looking out over the metropolis of Las Angeles, California,
I can't help but think about the young lady that I met here.

And so I wrote a song tonight,
And I call it My California Girl.

California girl,
You're living in a different world.
Let the sunshine in,
Right here where my love begins.

No, I won't ever hurt you.
No, I won't make you cry.
California girl,
I'm gonna love ya,
'Til the day I die, yeah.

Everybody help me sing this song one time, yeah.

California girl,
You're living by the sand and sea.
And it means everything little thing now,
Now that you belong to me.

And ohh, I'm gonna make you happy.
Ohhh, I'm gonna see you smile, yeah.
My California, California, California,
I'm gonna love ya, baby,
'Till the day I die, yeah.

California girl,
Oh, you're livin' in a different world,
Yes you are.
Woah, and it means every little thing darling,
Now that you are my girl, yeah, now.

No, I won't never hurt you.
Baby, I won't see you cry, no.
My California, California, California,
I'm gonna love ya, baby,
'Til the day I die, yeah.

Everybody help me sing this song,
One more time...

California girl,
California girl,
Oh, I'm gonna love ya, baby,
Yes I am,
'Til the day the day the day the day I die.

Ya see, I'm not ashamed tonight,
To say these words to the young lady,
That I met in the metropolis of Las Angeles, California.

Ha,

And as I look out over the sky tonight,
Through the fog and the through the smog,
I can't help but,
Think about that young girl.

Woah, ohhh, oh baby...
Everybody...
