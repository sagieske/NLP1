Song:

John the Wood went out one day
To view the scene from a different angle
He stood and watched a child at play
A-tinkling on an old triangle
Dave the Drum who was passing by
Bought the toy with a coin he'd picked up
You should have seen the gleam in his eye
As he saw a? Tune he's gleaned up? Shined up
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Out in the rain if you want a cup of tea
Dodge the puddles in the yard
The lord of the land's coming round to complain
It's hard
The peacock flew to a very high tree
He didn't like grass or concrete fairies
Put me where the action is
I'd rather be with the next-door hairies
Simon spied the bathroom door
In his hand's a herb shampoo
Waiting for the waters raw
So little time, so much to do
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Stand in a line, take a book along
There's time for a game of cards
Now it's your turn and the water's all gone
It's cold
The next to appear was the. ..
He needs a rest or at least he says so
You probably think that he's flipped his lid
Cause he wears high heels and a snow-white trousseau
Five foot three yet he stands so tall
And on the ground his feet are never
Friends may come and friends may go
But the fiddle bill goes on for ever
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
The music room would make you grin
It's cold as a freezing pit
There's a hole in the wall where a lorry came in
Let's split
I quite like a breast of chicken
And I'm crazy about aspic and roast quails
But the sight to make my pulse rate quicken
Is a dozen nice fat snails
On the other hand, there's Pegg on the bass
Whose tastes in food are very much wider
You'll see a smile light up his face
At a couple of kippers and a glass of cider
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Stand on a chair if you want to watch the box
The fleas can jump a mile
Peer through the haze watching Top Of The Pops
And smile
