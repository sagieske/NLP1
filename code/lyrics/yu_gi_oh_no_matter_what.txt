Song:

(first verse)
Yeah
Yeah
How did it come to this
After all we been through
Two of a pair now on opposite sides
From the very start with honor we dueled
We watched each other's back
And we battled with pride
We're closer than brothers
Now we're have to fight each other
And we trust our fate
To the heart of the cards
[Chorus:]
No matter what
Let the game begin
No matter what
May the best man win
No matter what
We're in this together
No matter what
We'll be friends forever
No matter what
(second verse)
Yeah
Yeah
It's been you and me
Hanging out playing games
Didn't ever think it would get this hard
Times running out
And so much at stake
Everything riding on the turn of a card
We'll show them what we're made of
As we fight for the ones we love
And we'll be friends to the very end
[Chorus:]
No matter what
Let the game begin
No matter what
May the best man win
No matter what
We're in this together
No matter what
We'll be friends forever
No matter what
(third verse)
Yeah
I don't wanna give up
But I will never give in
Don't wanna duel with my very best friend
We're an equal match
And we win every play
With so much at stake
I just can't walk away
Though I need a victory
You always meant the world to me
And that's one thing that will never change
[Chorus:]
No matter what
Let the game begin
No matter what
May the best man win
No matter what
We're in this together
No matter what
We'll be friends forever, yeah
No matter what
Let the game begin
No matter what
May the best man win
No matter what
We're in this together
No matter what
We'll be friends forever
No matter what
