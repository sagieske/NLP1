Song:

Look, it's happened once again
It happens ev'ry now and then
Feeling the hurt and hatin' all the men
Ready to stop it all

That's when I need a friendly face
To see me through these lonely days
Just to put some sunshine in my place
Don't take too long, I need you

Here I am
I haven't gone that far away,
And since I am
The kind of friend you know
Would stay with you through all the pain
Never to leave you in the rain
Ready to listen to what you've been through
Your woes and blues and share each other's...

Points of view
We've been there once before
And kept our points of view
It doesn't really matter if they're never quite the same
We have our rules in diff'rent ways,
We play the games of diff'rent folks with diff'rent strokes
And keep our points of view.

See, the world seems bright again
It only darkens now and then
Most of the time there's just no telling when
Look up and see you've got me.

Here we are
We may have gone our diff'rent ways
But since we are
The kind of friends who'll always stay
No matter what the pain,
Learnin' to love that cap o' rain
Ready to say we're here to stay in ev'ry way
Although we've got our diff'rent

Points of view
We've been there once before
And kept our points of view
It doesn't really matter if they're never quite the same
We have our rules in diff'rent ways,
We play the games of diff'rent folks with diff'rent strokes
And never really change our

Points of view
We've been there once before
And kept our points of view
It doesn't really matter if they're never quite the same
We have our rules in diff'rent ways,
We play the games of diff'rent folks with diff'rent strokes
And keep our points of view.
