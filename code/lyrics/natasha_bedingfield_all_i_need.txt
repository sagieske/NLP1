Song:

Yeah
Hey, hey hey
I'm a dreamer, I'm a gypsy
I'm a river passing bye
Got to run to keep up with me
I'm the sailor in the sky
And if I keep my heart open
If I wear it on my sleeve
No matter what life throwing
Nothing's ever gonna get to me
Hey, hey, hey...

All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got...

Let it row, row, row, right off my back
Let it flow, flow, flow, that's where I'm at... X2

I'm working up to something
Don't drag me down with you
We're all looking for that one thing
It's gonna pull us through
And I don't keep my heart open
Even if it starts to bleed
And all the daggers that you're throwing
It's gonna bounce right off of me
Hey, hey, hey...

All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got...

Let it row, row, row, right off my back
Let it flow, flow, flow, that's where I'm at... X2

Oh yeah I release, and I set free
Giving fear inside my steer*
And I give in, and I let out
Overthrowing any doubt
This is my sanctuary...

All I need is what I've got
My soul is free and I've got more than enough
I believe in love and I'll never stop
That's why all I need is what I've got... X2

Let it row, row, row, right off my back
Let it flow, flow, flow, that's where I'm at... X2
