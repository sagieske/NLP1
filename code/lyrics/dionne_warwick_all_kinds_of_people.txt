Song:

Tall kind of people should get together
With small kind of people should get together
And talk to each other
All kinds of people should reach out and help one another

Old kind of people should try to listen
To young kind of people
Should try to listen and comfort each other
All kinds of people should reach out and help one another

Light kind of people should feel compassion
For dark kind of people should feel compassion
And care for each other
All kinds of people should reach out and help one another

Light kind of people should feel compassion
For dark kind of people should feel compassion
And care for each other
All kinds of people should reach out and help one another
Hey, hey, help, one another, yeah

Reach out, ohh, reach out
Hey, reach out
Oh, reach out and help one another

Reach out, ohh, reach out
Hey, reach out
Reach out and help one another

Reach out, ohh, honey, reach out
Ohh, reach out
Hey, reach out and help one another

Reach out, reach out
Reach out
Reach out and help one another
