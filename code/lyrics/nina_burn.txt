Song:

Do you wanna be a poet and write
Do you wanna be an actor up in light
Do you wanna be soldier and fight for love
Do you wanna travel the world
Do you wanna be a diver for pearls
Or climb a mountain, touch the clouds above

Be anyone you want to be
Bring to life your fantasies
But I want something in return

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby!
Like a candle in my night
Oh burn, burn for me
Burn for me!

Are you gonna be a gambler and deal
Are you gonna be doctor and heal
Or go to heaven and touch God's face
Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps
Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps
Or an angel under grace

I'll lay down on your bed of coals
Offer out my heart and soul
But in return

I want you to burn
Burn for me baby!
Like a candle in my life
Oh burn, burn for me,
Burn for me!

Oh
I want you to burn, baby
Oh

Laugh for me, cry for me
Pray for me, lie for me
Live for me, die for me

I want you to burn
Burn for me, baby!
Like a candle in my life
Oh burn, burn for me, baby
Burn for me

I want you to burn
I want you to burn... For me baby!
Oh yeah
Burn for me... (burn for me)

I ant you to burn
Burn for me, baby
Like a candle in my night
Oh burn, burn for me
Burn for me

Oh... Burn for me...
