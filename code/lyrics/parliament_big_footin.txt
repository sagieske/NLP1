Song:

I know what you can do
Let us lay some funk on you
Funk on me?
Funk on you

Music for the young and old
Music good to your ear hole
Hey, hey, oh, Lord

Big foot music
I'm gonna be good to you
Big foot music
Good to your mama too

Big foot music
Music that will blow your mind
Big foot music
Music is right on time

I know what you can do
Let us lay some funk on you
Funk on me?
Funk on you

Big foot music
Music make you stomp your feet
Big foot music
Say, just clap your hands to the beat

Big foot music
Music gettin' in your bone
Big foot music
Music turns you on

I know what you can do
Let us lay some funk on you
Funk on me?
Funk on you

Lord, yes, ooh, Lord

Big foot music
Hey, good to you
Big foot music
Good to your mama too

Big foot music
Hey, music will blow your mind, Lord
Big foot music
