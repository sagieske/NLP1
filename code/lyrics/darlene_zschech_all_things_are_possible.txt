Song:

Almighty God my Redeemer, my hiding place, my strong refuge
No other name like Jesus, no power can stand against you
My feet are planted on this rock and I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from you alone, my Rock and my Salvation
Your praise is always on my lips, your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord

You fill my life with greater joy, as I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord

My feet are planted on this rock and I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from you alone, my Rock and my Salvation
Your praise is always on my lips, your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will be bless you Lord

You fill my life with greater joy, as I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord

When I am weak you make me strong,
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich for in the power of your name
All things are possible, all things are possible

Your praise is always on my lips, your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will be bless you Lord

You fill my life with greater joy, as I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord

When I am weak you make me strong,
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich for in the power of your name
All things are possible, all things are possible (... Till fade)
