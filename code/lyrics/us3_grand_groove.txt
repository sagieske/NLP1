Song:

Since before my adolescence remembrance of you commence
Will never forget how you taught a scrub to catch and connect
With pitchin', we'd sit and watch the Mets and Yankees
As bad as I was, can't remember if ya spanked me

While babysittin' this nigga, you became a father figure
Mowed the lawn with ya whenever, bourbon was your liquor
Who'd figure the strongest man I knew could have a bad ticker
And the last time we'd see each other was Christmas '95

Without ever havin' a chance to say goodbye
You left the summer of '96, the 1st of July
Now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaim the name, Nelson forever reigns

Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you

You moved from Queens to Tennessee when in my mid-teens
Later Atlanta, adopted Eileen when she was umpteen
Provided cream for your fam for years, retired
Now I understand what it is to be a man upon this planet

Took for granted the times you'd trip to NY on vacation
Thinkin' you'd be around for ever, probably neglected you
Unconsciously, the thought of me MCing made ya bug
Vividly at times imaging our last hug is bugged

Don't seem to realize you ain't comin' back, a routine check
How, while getting' dressed, did stress give you a heart attack?
Now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaim the name, Nelson forever reigns

Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you

We laughed for hours when you fell from off that bicycle
'Til tears trickled down my face, memories never erased
Laced with wisdom reflect up on my upbringing
Remember, you never missed a day
My school had me singing "Forever in my heart"

Never forget how much I love you
Thinkin' of you I miss the times together where it's better
You now reside in peace, released from all the pressure and pain
Your grandson proclaims the name, Nelson forever reigns

Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you
Grand Groove, king of my crew
Grand Groove, I dedicate this to you
