AN AMERICAN FAMILY
Writer Bob Corbin

Worked all his life in the railyards
Summer heat winter cold
He sits by the fire, this year he'll retire
Though he doesn't really feel all that old
She comes in from the kitchen
And sits on the arm of his chair
He looks up and says "hey lady I love you"
And runs his fingers through her hair
And there's a picture on the wall of Jesus in the garden
It's been there since they got the house in '53
Hey they ain't no big deal, ain't gonna go down in history
It's just a little story of an American family
She waited for him in World War 11
He fought the European campaign
Their sin John spent two years in "Nam
But that war wasn't the same
Billy's out in L.A.
He's a lawyer now
They worry he;s so far away
Jeannie got married
And lives there in town
They're comin' over with the kids today
And there's a picture on the wall of Jesus in the garden
It's been there since they got the house in '53
Hey they ain't no big deal, ain't gonna go down in history
It's just a little story of an American family
