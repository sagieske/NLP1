Song:

If you ever change your mind
About leavin', leavin' me behind
Oh yeah, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I've only hurt myself
Oh, now bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

I gave you jewelery and money too
But that's not all I gave to you
Oh, if you bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me girl, yeah, yeah

You know I'll always be your slave
Till I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh, honey bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, you know I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out day and night
I’ll forgive you darlin’, but you better bring it on home
Bring it on home to me, yeah
Bring it on home to me, yeah
Bring it on home to me, yeah

Bring it on home to me
Bring it on home to me, yeah
Bring it, bring it home to me
Bring it on home to me

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home
