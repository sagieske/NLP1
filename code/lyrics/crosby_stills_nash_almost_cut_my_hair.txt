Song:

Almost cut my hair
It happened just the other day
It's gettin kinda long
I coulda said it wasn't my way
But I didn't and I wonder why
I feel like letting my freak flag fly
Cause I feel like I owe it to someone

Must be because I had the flu for Christmas
And I'm not feeling up to par
It increases my paranoia
Like looking at my mirror and seeing a scar
But I'm not giving in an inch to fear
Cause I missed myself this year
I feel like I owe it to someone

When I finally get myself together
I'm going to get down in that sunny southern weather
And I find a place inside a laugh [?]
Separate the hooey from the chair [?]
I feel like I owe it
To someone
