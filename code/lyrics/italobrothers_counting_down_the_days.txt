Song:

Monday morning, it's cold outside
I'm sitting here all alone
Pack my bags and leave this town
'Cause if I stay I'll stay down

It's a long long way to reach for you
You appear in my dreams
And I pray that you exist
You're a creature I can't resist

I'm counting down the days
Until we meet again
Longing for you, every day

I'm counting down the days
I catch the star for you
Wanna hold your hand

I'm counting down the days
Until we meet again
Longing for you, every day

I'm counting down the days
I catch the star for you
Wanna hold your hand
Let me be your man

I'm counting down the days

Sunday evening, it's cold outside
I'm here on my own
Close my eyes to be with you
You turn up so true

There's a long long way to carry on
I'm waiting to the end
I know we need some day
When my love takes you away

I'm counting down the days
Until we meet again
Longing for you, every day

I'm counting down the days
I catch the star for you
Wanna hold your hand

I'm counting down the days
Until we meet again
Longing for you, every day

I'm counting down the days
I catch the star for you
Wanna hold your hand
Let me be your man

Let me be your man
