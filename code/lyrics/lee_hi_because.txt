Song:

Why is this my fault?
It’s all your fault.
How is this for me?
It’s for you.
Stop beating around the bush – it’s so like you

If it’s really for me,
If it’s really my fault
Then stop calling me,
I won’t pick up
I hope you’re unhappy – I’m sorry,
That’s a lie, a boy

You can forget me,
You can forget all of me,
You can be happy now
Just know one thing – I lived because of you

What do you want?
What more can I say?
How is this not over yet,
What do you want me to do?
Stop pushing it all together,
I said that I didn’t like to cry

If we’re gonna end this anyway,
If it’s is already over
Stop getting angry,
I won’t listen
I hope you’re unhappy – I’m sorry,
That’s a lie, a boy

You can forget me,
You can forget all of me,
You can be happy now
Let’s just clear up one thing before you leave – I only knew you

You can forget me,
You can forget all of me,
You can be happy now
Just know one thing – I lived because of you

Because of you Because of you
I laughed, I cried, those fiery days

You can forget all of me,
You can be happy now
We fought too much,
I can’t do this anymore

You can forget me,
You can forget all of me,
You can be happy now
Just know one thing – I lived because of you.
