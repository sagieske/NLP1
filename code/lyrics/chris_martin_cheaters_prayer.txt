(Intro)
... See Martin yah, woaai
Lawd hammercy
Woaai(2) hey(2)
It's not the first nor the last, so, so much pretty girl a pass and
Holding out is such a task, that's why me a seh this from mi heart

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, cause as far as I can see, 
She loves only me, 
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, but Lord if you can't stop me
From cheating, just don't let me get caught
No, no, no, don't let me get caught
Nooo, don't let me get caught(no no noo)
Said I hope I don't get caught

(Verse 1)
So listen to me now, it's such a sticky situation
Me promise my girl fi only look inna her direction
But everywhere me turn me see a next one(gosh) and me body get weak and a
Ball fi attention
I only wanna give the girls what they want, my lady says I'm wrong but she
Would understand 
I don't want to lie but I don't want to cry
Yo I'm so very weak inside

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, cause as far as I can see, 
She loves only me, 
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend(please don't met me cheat), 
But Lord if you can't stop me from cheating(if you), just don't let me get
Caught
No, noo, don't let me get caught
No, no, no, no don't let me get caught(none a tall)
Said I hope I don't get caught(please nuh mek she catch me Lord)

(Verse 2)
Yo, a nuh like me nuh try, I love my baby, but the girls them still deh pan
Me mind
It's unfair I can't deny, cause I couldn't dare to think about my lady and
Another guy(yuh mad)
And yo it hard, yo it hard, yo it hard to have one girl, it kinda rough fi
Play the part
She woulda lef me if she knew what's in my thoughts
I hope I never pay that cost.

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend(please nuh mek me cheat), 
Cause as far as I can see, she loves only me, 
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend(oh no), but Lord if you can't
Stop me from cheating(if you can stop me Lord), just don't let me get
Caught
Neva ever, don't let me get caught
Neva ever don't let me get caught(nuh mek she catch me)
Said I hope I don't get caught(hope I don't)

(Verse 3)
So listen to me now, she seh bun she never mek fi it
Fi get and can't give a straight craziness
Suh when me sidung and me meddy it, just can't mek she know seh she getting
It(yuh mad) (no)
One girl to a man, so we setting it
But fi we have one girl we keep forgetting it
Never get caught yet, we think we making it
I hope we don't end up regretting it

(Chorus)
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, cause as far as I can see, 
She loves only me, 
Oh Lord, don't let me cheat on my girlfriend, but Lord if you can't stop me
From cheating, just don't let me get caught...
