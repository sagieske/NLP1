Song:

She loves the way it feels, driving snowmobiles
And laughing at her dates when they don't know how to skate
She knows her hockey games and the players of the world
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An Real Canadian Girl

She's from the Miramichi by the old Atlantic Sea
But like the rolling tides she travels far and wide
So fond of the great outdoors with a glowing heart a twirl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An Real Canadian Girl

She's a real Canadian Girl, a real Canadian Girl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An real Canadian Girl

She'll brave the Yukon nights and dance to the northern lights
Then she's off to ski in the mountains of bc
In the summer she'll play ball
In the winter time she'll curl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An Real Canadian Girl

From the river of Saint John to the old Saskatchewan
Up along the Caribou she'll paddle her canoe
She loves the bears and birds and every little squirrel
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An Real Canadian Girl

She's a Real Canadian Girl, a real Canadian Girl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An a Real Canadian Girl

Now when you see her play she'll take yer breath away
Bathing in the sun or swimming just for fun
And if some lucky guy should land this presious pearl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An a Real Canadian Girl

She loves the way it feels driving snowmobiles
And laughing at her dates when they don't know how to skate
She knows her hockey games and the players of the world
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An a Real Canadian Girl

She's a real Canadian Girl, a real Canadian Girl
She's an all Acandian, northern lady
An a Real Canadian Girl
