Song:

Wrapping paper everywhere
Stacked up dishes, but who cares
They can wait until tomorrow now
It's you and me, and this old couch

The Christmas tree in our living room
Fills the room with pine perfume
And colored lights dancing on the walls
While Nat King Cole sings "Deck The Halls"

Don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go

Max got his bike
I swear, that kid
He's got it parked right by his bed
Jenny sure loves her puppy too
I'm not sure just who walked who

Thanks for my robe, no that's ok
It looks better on you anyway
What is it about this time of year
That makes our troubles disappear

'Cause don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go

We can't avoid it
No way around it
Before too long we'll be
Either back to work back to school
Or just back to reality

Don't you get the sense tonight
That for now the world is right
And as another Christmas ends
My mind drifts and once again
I'm thinking like a six year old
Only 364 days to go

Be here before you know it
