Song:

Sing me songs like
You wrote while I slept
Tear up the photographs
Of me that you kept

I will never give up hope of your return
That I will ever learn

I can always have you round
This true love and
I can never hold you down
This pure love and
I would go round telling
Everyone that you were mine
But I don't mind
I don't mind

Drive me round town
To find out who I am
Follow the trip now
To where it began
I am hungry for you
I'm restless for this time again

I can always have you round
This true love and
I can never hold you down
This pure love and
I would go round telling
Everyone that you were mine
But I don't mind
I don't mind

So here I stand my feet are firmly rooted to the ground
I'm still waiting for the moment that you turn around
Oh turn around
Won't you turn around... And stay

I can always have you round
This true love and
I can never hold you down
This pure love and
I would go round telling
Everyone that you were mine
But I don't mind
I don't mind
