Song:

After all this time

We used to think our love would be a fantasy
But things don't always turn out loud
There supposed to be
Hearts can break
And I won't surrender with so much at stake.

After all this time
Did you think I let you slip away from me
Girl, we've come too far
Just to turn our love into a memory.

Did you think that I can push you aside
All that we've been through
Me and you, never give a try
After all this time.

Easy to turn and walk away
When love goes wrong
Harder to stay and work it out
But if the love is strong
We must choose to hold on to something
We don't wanna lose.

After all this time...
