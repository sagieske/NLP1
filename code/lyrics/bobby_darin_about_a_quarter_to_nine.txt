Song:

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine
I mean this evenin' 'bout a quarter to nine
My lovin’ arms are gonna tenderly twine
All around you, around a quarter to nine

I know I won’t be late 'cause at half past eight
I'm gonna hurry there, I’ll be waitin’ where the lane begins
Waitin’ for you on needles and pins
And then this world is gonna be mine
This evenin' 'bout a quarter to nine
Get it, ah ah, oh oh

The stars are gonna twinkle and shine
This evenin' around a quarter to nine
Both these lovin’ arms are gonna tenderly twine
There around you around a quarter to nine

I know I won’t be late 'cause at half past eight
You know I'm gonna be there, I’ll be waitin’ right where the lane begins
I'll be waitin’ for you on needles and pins
And then, then you're gonna be mine
This very evenin' around a quarter to nine
