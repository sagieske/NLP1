[Malik Yusef:]
In your high honor
All over my skin that's art splattered
And everything happened this part mattered
I tattooed your name on my tongue
Then my heart shattered
But for effort I get an "AYY GIRL"
So tonight be the vip guests of jyj Malik Yusef and Kanye West

[Kanye West:]
Living life like there's no damn rules
Tonight I'm finna hop up in that hotel pool
Grab your hand white dress your gone hop in too
Get everything that being at the top includes
What's your friend's attitude, why she so damn rude? Huh?
Tell her smile for a change
If a baller come around, she gone smile for the change
I know the type, I know the life
I know your living your life for the night, another night
Ask the city what they got for us
That mean it wasn't any poppin' if it not for us
Then isn't isn't this all that I said it'd be
I want the best for you, but want better for me, ugh
I paid the price of fame, icy chain
Stack my money tall, hide in vain

Let's do it, flashing light
Have the time of your life
Living it up for tonight
Yeah she living it up for tonight

[All]Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
Just run through me
What have you done to me
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
I'm losing my cool
Playing me for a fool

[All]Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night
Another night
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night
Another night

[Junsu]We were so high, we touch the sky
You broke my heart, tore me apart
[Jaejoong]I never lost like this, now it's you who'll miss
Like I did give, cause for the night you told me

[Yuchun]I'm not the type
Flashing lights
Have the time of your life
Livin' it up for tonight
Yeah she livin' it up for tonight

[All]Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
Just run through me
What have you done to me
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
I'm losing my cool
Playing me for a fool

Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night

Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night

[Junsu]You came and shut it down
Suddenly you run this town
Wanted to be with you
All I had was me and you

[Jaejoong]Now everything is changed
You act differently
You do me wrong
I knew all along

[Yoochun]So cold in the rain
Gave my heart in vain
([All]I'm still in love with you I can't get over you)
[Junsu]You got me insane
Get out of my brain
([All]I'm still in love with you I can't get over you)
[Jaejoong/Junsu]C'mon, get out~

[All]Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
Just run through me
What have you done to me
Ayy girl, I tried to make you my baby
Ayy girl, instead you make me go crazy
I'm losing my cool
Playing me for a fool

Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night

Ayyyyyy, ayy, ayy girl
I know your type, I know the life
I know you living your life for the night

Another Night...
