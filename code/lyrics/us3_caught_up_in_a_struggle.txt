Song:

Move with precision, decisions to make, fakes to shake
Talk a good game but yo, your stash ain't no wins
I'm in the biz of makin' it big and express myself
Through jams that they even bop to in Japan, my man

Change for a dollar so I can make this call
Get my money correct cause I been broke too long
Gotta keep it legit, can't be locked for years
Find me a 9 to 5, blood sweat and tears

But can it work boss man smack the jerk for tryin' to jerk me
Thinkin' I can't see inconsistency in my currency
Now I'm back out on the street
Walking these dogs for ends meet, life's not sweet

But I still rock rhymes to beats
Put it together maybe we can make an explosion
But it takes time, record labels mess up your mind
You could press rewind and catch a dose one more time

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Gimme mine and I'll spark the chart like flint
Money spent back to start, who wants parts of this
Crisp on compact disk but don't you diss the vinyl mix
I got the hook up at the crib

That's my escape from this world today, watch 'em blow up
Then deflate like a souffle, I see it every day, all day
I'm out for the gold, forget the silver and the bronze
Gotta make dough, send home to wifey and moms

Invest in real estate, computers and all this
Plan's flawless, bumpy roads, I'm ready
So all you fakers get jetty or get chopped up like confetti
I'm on a mission for this permanent position

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

On the bricks, scuffed up kicks, not a hint of dough
Lost my job, now I'm livin' like a slob
Re-plan regroup, gotta hook up with my make money troops
Two scoops of loops, studio, time to blow

Hip-hop scene flooded, everybody gettin' blunted
A& R's frontin', guess I gotta prove somethin'
Over percussion, Shabaam Sahdeeq rushin' like the Kremlin
Got mc's tremblin' in their lab, take a stab at me

Superior with word play
Stress overtakes the fakes everyday all day
Rugged like Broadway, no time for horseplay
In the struggle don't you lower your level

Gotta take charge like credit, need to start talkin' aesthetic
Cause when you lose your chance you will regret it, get it
Lyrics embedded in your head like memories
Remember these Us3 melodies

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that

Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, man
Caught up in a struggle
You got me caught up in a struggle like that, like that
