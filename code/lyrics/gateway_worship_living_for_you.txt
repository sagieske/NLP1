Song:

This is the day, the hour, the time I give it all away to
You
I wanna say I'll go Your way, living my life for
Something real
I can't survive, I can't go on if I'm with- out You by my
Side
I wanna spend eternity with You
You've turned my world upside down
My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for
You
I'll let my light shine for You
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for You

You've turned my world upside down
My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for
You
I'll let my light shine for You
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for
You've turned my world upside down
My life is spinning 'round You now, all of me, all for
You
I'll let my light shine for You
Nothing's gonna stop me now, I'm living for You
