Glinda! Is it true - you were her friend?

GLINDA:
Well - it depends what you mean by "friend". I did know her. That is, our paths did cross. At school...

STUDENTS:
O HALLOWED HALLS AND VINE-DRAPED WALLS
THE PROUDLIEST SIGHT THERE IS
WHEN GREY ANDSERE OUR HAIR HATH TURNED
WE SHALL STILL REVERE THE LESSONS LEARNED
IN OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD SHIZ
OUR DAYS AT DEAR OLD...

GALINDA:
OH-OH-OH-OH-OLD...

STUDENTS AND GALINDA:
DEAR OLD SHIZ-ZZZZ
