Song:

I guess some kids are just born with tragedy in their blood,
I try to wash this away,
I wanna cleanse your veins,

I can help you see the light out of your despair,
You tie the rope, I'll kick the f*****g chair,

I feel the malice in my veins,
My heart swells with hatred in your name,
And when you've got nothing to turn black and blue,
You've still got Hell to look forward to,

You've still got Hell,
You've still got Hell,
When you've still got Hell,

I will dance on your grave,
I will dance on your f*****g grave,
I will dance on your grave,
I will dance on your grave,

Oh, when you're blessed with a grave to call your own,
In my mind you'll be six feet closer to your home,
Your eulogy will be music,
Your eulogy will be music to my ears,

Oh, yeah,

I can help you to see light out of your despair,
You tie the rope, I'll kick the f*****g chair,

I feel the malice in my veins,
And my heart swells with hatred in your name,
And when you've got nothing to be black and blue,
You've still got Hell,
You've still got Hell to look forward to,

Black and blue,
Black and blue,

I have never really f*****g cared,
Tie the rope, I'll kick the f*****g air
I have never really f*****g cared,
Tie the rope, I'll kick the f*****g chair,
Let's go
