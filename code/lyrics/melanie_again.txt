Song:

Nothing for me to do
But be alone
Tonight
Maybe I'll sit and write
'Cause if I don't
The ones I met won't
Be my friends for life
Where did I put my paper and pen
Well, I'm looking around
Again
My room is a mess
I can't find the address
Of the ones I like best
Again
Nothing for me to do
But be alone
Again
Where did I put my friend
I lost the address
Of the place I like best
And I'm looking around
Again
Nothing for me to do
Well, I'm looking around
Again
Where did I put my friend
I lost the address
Of the place I like best
And I'm looking around
Again
Nothing for me to do
But be alone
Tonight
Maybe I'll sit and write
'Cause if I don't
The ones I met won't
Be my friends for life
