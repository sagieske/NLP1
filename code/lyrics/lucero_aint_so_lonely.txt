Song:

She smiles oh so sweetly and I ain't so lonely
She acts like she don't need me and I ain't so lonely

We drive down to the corner drugstore and I ain't so lonely
Coca-cola and pills take a few more and I ain't so lonely

It's been a while since I was nineteen
It's been a while since I've seen myself act like such a fool
How long must this go on tonight

By myself on the long drive home I ain't so lonely
Cause I like hearing the sad songs and I ain't so lonely
