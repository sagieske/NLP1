Song:

Here we stand today
Like we always dreamed
Starting out our life together
The light is in your eyes
The love is in our hearts
I can't believe you're really mine forever

Been rehearsing for this moment all my life
So don't act surprised
If the feeling starts to carry me away

On this day
I promise forever
On this day
I surrender my heart
Here I stand, take my hand
And I will honor every word that I say
On this day

Not so long ago
This earth was just a field
Of cold and lonely space, without you
Now everything's alive
Now everything's revealed
And the story of my life
Is all about YOU

For if you feel the cool winds
Blowing through your nights
I will shelter you
And forever here to chase your fears away

On this day
I promise forever
On this day
I surrender my heart
Here I stand, take my hand
And I will honor every word I say
On this day

(Instrumental)

I've been rehearsing for this moment all my life
So don't act surprised
If the feeling starts to carry me away

On this day
I promise forever
On this day
I surrender my heart
Here we stand like I planned
Please say you'll always look at me this way
Like on this day...
