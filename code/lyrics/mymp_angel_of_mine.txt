Song:

Ooh, Angel, ooh, ooh

Oh when I first saw ya, I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought I'd never find
Angel of mine

I look at you, looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Gonna love you till the end of time
Angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life, sent from above
Never did I dream such a perfect love
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel of mine

Ooh, angel, yeah, mmm

Nothing means more to me the more we share
The world in this whole world can ever compare
Last night awake your moves are still on my mind
Angel, angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
You came into my life, sent from above
Never did I dream such a perfect love
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel of mine (of mine)

Ooh angel of, angel (angel)
I never knew I could feel each moment, as everyone new
Every breath I take, or vow that I make
I wanna share it with you
When I first saw ya I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought I'd never find
Angel of mine

You came into my life, sent from above (up above baby baby baby)
Never did I dream such a perfect love (a perfect love)
And I'll adore you till the end of time
Angel of mine

What you mean to me you'll never know
Deep inside I need to show
I look at you, looking at me
Now I know why they say the best things are free
Gonna love you till the end of time
Angel of mine
