Song:

Ain't none ever seen the face of his foe no
He ain't made of flesh & bone
He's the one who sits up close beside you
An when he's there you are alone

Every man is evil yes an every man is a liar
An unashamed with the wicked tongues sing
In the black soul choir

Yes an no man ever seen the face of my lord no
Not since he left his skin
He's the one you keep cold on the outside girl
He's at your door let him in

O I will forgive your wrongs
Yes I am abel
An for my own I feel great shame
I would offer up a brick to the back of your head boy
If I were cain
