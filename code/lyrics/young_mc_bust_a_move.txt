"Bust it
This here's a tale for all the fellas,
Try to do what those ladies tell us,
Get shot down cuz you're over zealous.
Play hard to get females get jealous.
Ok, smarty, go to a party.
Girls are scantilly clad and showin' body,
A chick walks by, ya wish ya could s** her,
But she's in another world like you was poindexter.
Next day's function, high class luncheon.
Food is served, and you're stone cold munchin'.
Music comes on, people start to dance,
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants.
A girl starts walkin', guys start gawkin',
Sits down next to you and starts talkin'.
Says she wanna dance cuz she likes to groove,
So come on, fatso, and just bust a move.
You're on a mission,
And you're wishin' someone could cure your lonely condition.
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places,
No fine girls, just ugly faces.
From frustration, first inclination,
Is to become a monk and leave the situation.
But ever dark tunnel has a light, I hope,
So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope.
New movie's showin', so you're goin',
Could care less about the five you're blowin'.
Theatre gets dark just to start the show,
Then you spot a fine woman sittin' in your row.
She's dressed in yellow, she says hello,
Come sit next to me ya fine fellow.
You run over there without a second to lose,
And what comes next, hey, bust a move.
In the city, ladies look pretty,
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty.
Tell a funny joke just to get some play,
Then you try to make a move and she says no way.
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin',
They want a man who brings home the bacon.
Got no money and got no car,
Then you got no woman and there you are.
Some girls are sophistic, materialistic,
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic.
They're lyin' on the beach, perpetratin' a tan
So that a brother with the money can be their man
So, on the beach start strollin', real high rollin',
Everything you have is yours and not stolen.
A girl runs up with something to prove,
So don't just stand there, bust a move
Just bust a move
Break it down for me fellas
Your best friend, Harry, has a brother Larry...
In five days from now he's gonna marry.
He's hopin' you can make it there, if you can,
Cuz in the ceremony you'll be the best man.
You say neato, check your libido,
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo.
The bride walks down, just to start the wedding...
And there's one more girl you won't be getting.
So you start thinkin', then ya start blinkin',
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now you're feeling really fine cuz the girl is stacked.
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin',
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'.
Says she wanna dance to a different groove,
Now you know what to do, g, bust a move.
Just bust a move
Move it boy. "
