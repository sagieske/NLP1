Song:

No, I won't call you baby.
I won't buy you daisies, cause that don't work.
And I know, how to get you crazy,
How to make you want me, so bad it hurts.

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But that's not, not, not your type.
So I'm gonna be bad for you tonight, tonight, tonight.

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (turns you on)
No mister right if you want mister wrong (mister wrong)
I'll tell you lies (tell you lies), if you don't like the truth
I don't wanna be bad (I don't wanna be bad),
I just wanna be bad enough for you.
Well I just wanna be bad enough for you,
Well I just wanna be bad enough...

Hey (Hey, hey)

Thanks for the number (Thanks for the number).
I'm not gonna call you (Not gonna call you),
Cause that won't work (Cause that won't work).
You like to play (Play, hey)
Hide and go get her (Hide and go get her)
Cause you like me better (You like me better),
When I play the jerk (When I play the jerk).

I wanna be good, good, good to you
But that's not, not, not your type.
So I'm gonna be bad for you tonight, tonight, tonight.

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (Turns you on)
No mister right if you want mister wrong (mister wrong)
I'll tell you lies (tell you lies), if you don't like the truth.
I don't wanna be bad (I don't wanna be bad)
I just wanna be bad enough for you.
Well I just wanna be bad enough for you,
Well I just wanna be bad enough...

You love to hate me when I'm chasing you (Woah-oh)
But I hate to say this, I'm stuck on lovin' you.
So I pretend that I don't care, I'll stand you up to keep you here.
I'll make you hate me, just enough to make you want me.

I'll misbehave if it turns you on (Turns you on)
No mister right if you want mister wrong (mister wrong)
I'll tell you lies (tell you lies), if you don't like the truth.
I don't wanna be bad (I don't wanna be bad)
I don't wanna be bad (I don't wanna be bad)
I don't wanna be bad (I don't wanna be bad)
I just wanna be bad enough for you.
Well I just wanna be bad enough for you,
Well I just wanna be bad enough for you.
