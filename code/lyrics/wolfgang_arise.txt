Song:

(Vocals - basti)
I am the night
I am the day
I am the light gone astray
The fear that's in your bones
That is I, I am the taker of souls
Shout, my name at the heavens
And be cast to fire
Hold my hand
As we roam with the pack
'Cause is evil is our lair
'Cause is evil is our lair
Sentinels of pain
On their mission once again
He end, them out to roam
Half dog men and their knives
Haunting your lives
Pray, it's good to pray
In our masses we shall say
He is no more and will be dead
Though he is laughing
Beside you instead
I am the king
I need no queens nor friends
You bow before me because
Blood is my feast
And fear is my staff
And I will come to take you and yours away
Listen! To me my child
I'll feed your body
Free your mind
Come closer if you dare
To this manner of beast
'Cause is evil is our lair
'Cause is evil is our lair
'Cause is evil is our lair
'Cause is evil is our lair
