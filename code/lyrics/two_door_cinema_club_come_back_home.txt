Song:

Another Saturday
Another careless move
Tells the world
That you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up
And someone calls your name
But I can tell
You don't know how to play this game

I know this isn't it
You'll hit your target some day

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way

So tell me what you need
And I'll accommodate
But if too long goes by
You just might be too late
An opportunity
You can't afford to waste
So have the lines in your head first
For heaven's sake

You hear the day beckoning
Know what it's all in your head

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength

So now you're on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way
