Song:

I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind when I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us

Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

We look for love, no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is and it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait, not for those who wait too late
We've got to go for all we know

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us

Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And, darling, when the morning comes and I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us

Just the two of us
Building big castles way on high
Just the two of us
You and I

Let's get it together, baby
