Song:

Lucifer, I summon thee to my black mass, 
I call upon you to complete my evil task.
My heart is black and my soul is dead, 
Hear my words of hate give me strength.

Hear me Lucifer, 
Black Mass, Black Mass, 
Take me Higher, Higher, 
Black Mass, Black Mass.

Faceless Ones summon me to crypts below, 
Now I join them I have given him my soul.
Down, down further into drugs and hate, 
Black, black masses I am doomed this is my fate.
