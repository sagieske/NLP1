Lyrics: D. Schoufs/D. Schoovaerts
I gave up all my friends
My girls from out of town
Bought her what she wanted
Yet she let me down
When she saw me crying
She said I had no heart
When my heart was bleeding
She turned around and laughed
Girls don't cry for Louie
Louie wouldn't cry for you
When you walk the streets for Louie
You better do what Louie tells you to
I met Louie on a hazy morning
When the bars where closing down
He said honey I really like your prancing
You and I we'll burn this town
This woman, sir, mislead me
Hurt me in my pride
Who are you to judge me?
Who are you to take her side?
She cheated on me mister
Told me nothing but lies
I just had to teach her
Not to overstep the line
Girls don't cry for Louie
He wouldn't waste a tear on you
When you walk the streets for Louie
You ain't walking down no avenue
I met Louie on an early morning
In a sleazy part of town
I was tipsy and feeling kind'a lonely
Louie offered me his arm
He said: you and I we'll burn this town
He said: you and I we'll burn this town
