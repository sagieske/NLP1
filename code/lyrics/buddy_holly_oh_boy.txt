Song:

All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know
What you been a missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me

All of my life
I been a - waitin'
Tonight there'll be
No hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me

Stars appear
And the shadows are fallin'
You can hear
My heart callin'
A little bit of lovin'
Makes everything right
And I'm gonna see
My baby tonight

All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know
What you been a missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me

(solo)

All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know
What you been a missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me

All of my life
I been a - waitin'
Tonight there'll be
No hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me

Stars appear
And the shadows are fallin'
You can hear
My heart callin'
A little bit of lovin'
Makes everything right
And I'm gonna see
My baby tonight

All of my love
All of my kissin'
You don't know
What you been a missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world can see
That you were meant for me
