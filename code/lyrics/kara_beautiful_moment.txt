Song:

Standing here right now
How can I contain what I'm feeling?
In the quiet of my heart
This is what Your love is revealing
Chorus
When I think about the life You gave for me
So I could be with You eternally
I think about the cross that rescued me
In a beautiful moment
I wanna give my life right back to You
So You are glorified in all I do
Every thought I have just brings me to
This beautiful moment
Oh, oh
I can see the sun
You saved me from the dark that surrounds me
Because of what You've done
Finally forgiveness has found me
I think about the life You gave for me
So I could be with You eternally
I think about the cross that rescued me
In a beautiful moment
I wanna give my life right back to You
So You are glorified in all I do
Every thought I have just brings me to
This beautiful moment
Nothing I can give could compare
Nothing
Oh, nothing
I will give You all that I have
I think about the life You gave for me
So I could be with You eternally
I think about the cross that rescued me
In a beautiful moment
I wanna give my life right back to You
So You are glorified in all I do
Every thought I have just brings me to
This beautiful moment
I think about the life You gave for me
So I could be with You eternally
I think about the cross that rescued me
In a beautiful moment
I wanna give my life right back to You
So You are glorified in all I do
Every thought I have just brings me to
This beautiful moment
Oh, every thought
Every thought brings me right to you
Just brings me right back to this beautiful moment
