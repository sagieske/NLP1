Song:

Everytime the phone rings I pray it might be you
That you thought out all the answers
Wanna get back togeter again
Oh but a strangers voice rings thru my ears
And though I listen you are all I hear
And girl I didn't mean to drive you away
People come and go so fast
But all I see is your face

There's an old man on the corner
Just staring at the sea
I wanna hold him like a broken doll
Ask him if he's lonely like me
The waves crash like a violent dream
The mist flies and the seagulls scream
And the old man he sees nothing just stares into space
And me all I can see is your face

Now I know there are no promises in love
You've gotta give it all you have
And hope that maybe you can share
Maybe you can share your life with someone
A stranger touches me and all I can feel
Is your embrace
A stranger looks my way
And all I ever see is your face

I've got my songs to protect me
I've got my friends to ease the pain
They say time will heal this emptiness
Girl without you it ain't the same
I don't see any stars tonight
Just the darkness of the city lights
I close my eyes once more and try to escape
And all I can see is your face
