Song:

I know you hear me girl
I am knocking open the door
I don’t give a damn who is watching
I never stop
I know everybody has done something for their one
I ain’t crazy I am just a fan of love
I hear what I said
I’ve been here before
So pardon my... I want your love
Don’t care what they say I want you hard
Some may call me crazy

Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what you say
I want your love let me take you away
Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what they say
Oo I am fanatik
Oooo I am a love fanatik

Yeah this love is automatic I’ve been here waiting
For your love and I am not stopping until is mine
I know everybody has done something for their one
I ain’t crazy I am just a fan of love
I hear what I said
I’ve been here before
So pardon my... I want your love
Don’t care what they say I want you hard
Some may call me crazy

Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what you say
I want your love let me take you away
Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what they say
Oo I am fanatik
Oooo I am a love fanatik

Girl call me crazy
Girl I ain’t taking the shut
Someone clal the doctor
This love is making me sick
Call me crazy ...

Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what you say
I want your love let me take you away
Hey yoo I am a fanatic I don’t care what they say
Oo I am fanatik
Oooo I am a love fanatik
