Song:

I've got blood on my hands
From this little timid life
It's just like a man
To trust me with all his might

I've got blood on my feet
When I kicked you back 3 weeks
If I promised to keep my mouth shut
Can I sit here while you speak

Finally mine
You're finally all mine
Finally mine
You're finally all mine
Where did it get me, all mine
What did it teach me, all mine
Somebody stop me
I'm losing control again

I've got honor to earn
But I guess I lost my turn
When will I learn
To treat you with concern

Finally mine
You're finally all mine
Finally mine
You're finally all mine
Where did it get me, all mine
What did it teach me, all mine
Somebody stop me
I'm losing control again

Where did it get me, all mine
What did it teach me, all mine
Somebody stop me
I'm losing control again

All mine
Where did it get me, all mine
Look what it taught me, all mine
Somebody stop me
I'm losing control
