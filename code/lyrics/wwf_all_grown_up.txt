Song:

I'm all grown up now, and I've listened and learned
A True Star and I?m finally gettin my turn
Took my hell, earned my spot
Im a be here for a minute sonny boy if you like it or not
While you think about chicks and whips
I'm on the out though
Im Laid back, sun in my face, just like pablo, now I'm turned around
Now that the world is mine
Aint a cloud in the sky that could stop my shine, I love it
I did came from the grime and grit
Now Im on top shinin on rhymin shh..
When you think about me you think of the best
Like a full length mink, going new corvette.. yes
When I spit consider the mess
I'm markin' my pass
6 digits nothin less
When you think of Jackie O you think of success, success, success

I?m all grown up now
Gonna show this world how a woman takes on it all
And watch the old guard fall
I?m ready for, the, world to come to me
Everyone to see
I?ll make you believe I?m in control

Destiny shines
Take your fame and make it mine
Listen, yo, that old cheap flow got to go
I took my setbacks, got knocked out, but I aint sweat that
Tried to lean back, count chips, and get my keys back
Sick of loss, bumpin me back, like who the boss
Im a show you howta floss in the box da paws(?)
Never thought it be this way, uh
Till I made it on BIG
Got my money right
Fames what I?ve waited on
For years I?ve been hated on, spit on, and kicked on
Aint nobody stoppin my flow, Im a let you know if baby girl a big show
Rise and fall one blink of the eyes, surprised? It cant take the saw.
See life try to do me, snuff me one two me
Industry is shady, family tried to sue me thats the life I live
Try to shush me I come back strong, stay on top and last for long

I?m all grown up now
Gonna show this world how a woman takes on it all
And watch the old guard fall
I?m ready for, the, world to come to me
Everyone to see
I?ll make you believe I?m in control

Im all grown up .... now
Im all grown up
Im all grown up .... now
now...
