Ha ha ha ha alright, ha ha yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
Yeah yeah
How do you want me to love you?
Oh yeah yeah
Where did you come from
Baby what's your name?
I gotta tell you something, please let me
Explain
I'm the kind of man who could treat you
Right
Give you what you need girl every day, every
Night
Give me a reason, show me a sign
Just let me know that I'm not wasting my time
(wasting my time)
I'll give you all that you want, be your
Everything man (ahh)
You wish will be my command (your wish will be my
Command)
How do you want me to love you?
Take it fast, take it slow, baby let me
Know
How do you want me to love you?
With my heart, with my soul
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
Ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
Yeah, ha ha ha ha ha ha yeah
I look right through you, and you turn
Away
Tell me how much longer must we both play this
Game?
What's it gonna take now, I gotta make you
See
We should be together girl, it's our
Destiny
You need a lover who can show you the way
(ahh)
If you've got a problem I can make it okay (make
It okay)
Now that I've found you I can't let you go
(ahh)
So girl won't you just let me know
How do you want me to love you?
Take it fast, take it slow, baby let me
Know
How do you want me to love you?
With my heart, with my soul
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
How do you want me to love you?
How do you want me to love you? Oh oh
How do you want me to love you?
How do you want me to love you?
How do you want me to love you?
Take it fast, take it slow, baby let me
Know
How do you want me to love you?
With my heart, with my soul
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
Baby, take it fast, take it slow
How do you want me to love you?
Take it fast, take it slow, baby let me
Know
Baby, with my heart, with my soul
How do you want me to love you?
With my heart, with my soul
I'll take you anywhere you want to go
Love.. Annabel
