Song:

Wake up when will things be good enough for you to see
All that we can be
I'm sick of playin' games and actin' like we never care
That we're never there
We pay attention for only seconds

Look at you, look at me
There's never any us, can't you see?
All we can become we can shine like the sun
If we believe that 2 stars are brighter than one

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at you
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at me

Listen the way we feel is not just about you or me
It's the harmony, just give in
'Cuz together we'll be brighter than any star, a work of art
We'll make the sky bright, we'll light it, you and I

Look at you, look at me
There's never any us, can't you see?
All we can become we can shine like the sun
If we believe that 2 stars are brighter than one

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at you
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Is it too much to ask that you put us first, oh?
I feel like we're last in the universe
And that's not where we oughta be

Look at you, look at me
There's never any us, can't you see?
All we can become we can shine like the sun
If we believe that 2 stars are brighter than one

Look at you, look at me
There's never any us, can't you see?
All we can become we can shine like the sun
If we believe that 2 stars are brighter than one

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at you
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at you
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look at me
