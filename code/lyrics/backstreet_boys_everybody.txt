Song:

Everybody
Rock your body
Everybody
Rock your body right,
Backstreet's back alright!

Oh my god we're back again
Brothers sisters everybody sing
Gonna bring the flavor
Show you how
Gotta a question for you
Better answer now
Am I original
Yeah
Am I the only one
Yeah
Am I sexual
Yeah
Am I everything you need
You better rock your body now

[Chorus:] everybody yeah
Rock your body yeah
Everybody
Rock your body right
Backstreet's back alright

Now throw your hands up in the air
And wave 'em around like you just don't care
If you wanna party let me hear you yell
Cuz we've got it going on again

Am I original yeah
Am I the only one
Yeah
Am I sexual
Yeah
Am I everything you need
You better rock your body now

Chorus (x3)
