Song:

It's been a long time since I saw you
Been so long since I touched your face
You know there's nothing I can do
That will help to get me through
'Cause I know you wont be there for me again

Chorus:
If I could dream about tomorrow
If I could dream the night away
You know there's nothing I could do
To get me over you

You used to be there every morning
You had that smile upon your face
But now that smile is turned around
And my world is upside down
'Cause I know you won't be there for me again

Chorus

Bridge:
I know I'll miss you, but you will never hurt again
I know you're happy, but now I feel such emptiness inside

Solo

Chorus

Can't stop the pain
