Song:

[Verse:]
Theres no way to say this songs about someone else
Every time you're not in my arms
I start to lose myself
Someone please pass me my shades
Don't let them see me down
You have taken over my days
So tonight I'm going out

[Pre-Chorus:] Yeah I'm feeling like
There is no better place than right by your side.
I had a little taste
And I'm always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But your the only one on my mind

[Chorus:]
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
Theres only me Theres only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you're gone I'll think of you

[Verse 2:]
All these places packed with people
But your face is all I see
And the musics way to loud
But your voice wont let me be.
So many pretty girls around
They're just dressing to impress
But the thought of you alone
Has got me smiling
I don't know what to say next

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah I'm feeling like there is no better place than right by your side
I had a little taste
Now I'm always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But your the only one on my mind

[Chorus:] x2
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
Theres only me Theres only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone Ill think of you

[Bridge:]
Ill pretend the night is so beautiful
Take a photo with the bros
La da dee
La da da doo
They won't see through my disguise Right here behind my eyes
Replaying in my mind
La dee da
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm feeling like
There is no better place than
Right by your side
I had a little taste
Now I'm always for the party anywhere
Cause all the girls are looking fine
But your the only one on my mind

[Chorus:] x2
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
Theres only me Theres only you
La da dee
La la da doo
La la da me
La la da you
La da dee
La la da doo
When you are gone I'll think of you
