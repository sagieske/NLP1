Song:

Here it comes again
It's talking through the band
All the? You took
Is waiting out 'till then

Breathe
Life
You ask
Will pray
Scream
We're dead
You pay
I'll cry

Sell you're sure again
We're still in the band
Pride has gone to yours
Sucked your spinners yeah

Breathe
Life
You ask
Will pray
Scream
We're dead
You pay
I'll try
