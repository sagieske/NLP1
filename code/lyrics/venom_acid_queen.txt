Song:

You - have got everything i need
You - can bring my soul out of me
I'll pay your wicked price-deliver your merchandise
Gypsy you'll drive me a dream


Acid Queen


Wild - tames the raging beast
Child - helps the blind to see
Demon controls my mind - leaves the real world behind
Mould me a purgatory scene


Acid Queen


Acid Queen...


Can you hear me - i said get out of here you..


Witch - now you've given all you've got
Bitch - thought you'd left me here to rot
You're coming down and fast - you've tripeed your very last
I'll take your place and sing


Acind King
