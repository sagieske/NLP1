Song:

So you came to this meeting
Broken and confused
Listen to this song
For in it there is good news
Cast your cares on Jesus
Haven't you heard all that He can do?
Deliverance is available to you

Chorus: Deliverance is available to you
Deliverance is available to you (to you)
(You should) Trust Only One
He is able to see you through
He's been waiting (He's waiting) and wanting (He's wanting)
To work a miracle for you
Deliverance is available to you

Please don't leave this meeting
Wounded and Distressed
Seize this Godly moment
Your position to be blessed (to be blessed)
Put all your cares on Jesus
Haven't you heard all that He can do?
Deliverance is available to you
Oh yes it is!

Chorus: Deliverance is available to you
Deliverance is available to you
(You should) Trust Only One
He is able (He is able) to see you through
(Make up you mind, Make up you mind),
He's been waiting (He's waiting) and wanting (He's wanting)
To work a miracle for you
Deliverance is available to you
Oh yes it is!

(God's got enough power)
God's got enough power in the hem of his garment
(To satisfy) To satisfy your need
(You must step out on His word) Step out on His world
(You gotta Believe) Believe and you'll receive
(Freedom) Freedom for your hurt
(Victory) Victory for your pain

Approximate vamp: Deliverance is available to you
My God is most capable
He can the do the impossible,
Reach the unreachable,
Save the unsavable, that's my God!
That's my God!

Deliverance is available to you
Deliverance is available to you
(Doesn't matter what you've done,
Where you are from, who you; ve hurt,
Where you've been, there's no power,
No power like Jesus!)
Deliverance (Claim it) is available

(Speak it) My God is most capable.
Deliverance is available to you
(You must believe it) Deliverance is available to you
(He can do the impossible)

It's available, it's available.
