Song:

By Take That

Put your head against my life
What do you hear
A million words just trying to make
The love song of the year
Close your eyes but don't forget
What you have heard
A man who's trying to say three words
The words that make me scared

A million love songs later
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later
And here I am

Looking to the future now
This is what I see
A million chances pass me by
A million chances to hold you
Take me back, take me back
To where I used to be
To hide away from all my truth
Through the light I see

A million love songs later
And here I am trying to tell you that I care
A million love songs later
And here I am
