24's Calicos
That's how all my gangsters roll
Get dat dough fuck dem hoes
That's how gg-g-unit rolls
24's Calicos
That's how all my gangster roll
Get dat dough fuck dem hoes
That's how gg-g-unit rolls

[Young Buck]
I got my pistol in my lap, and the top drop down
An AK in the back cuz a nigga hot now
And I been shooting, and I been robbing
Fifty telling niggas I'm a mutherfuckin prophet [gun shot]
I come from the bottom, but birds I got'em
I ?grip? two cents in harlem , serve all'em
To me what I deserve man
Fuck what you heard man
They doing a Tennekee?
So who tha' real wurd man
They try to stop us, but I load up my choppa
Put my eye in tha' scope and pop'em right in their pajamas [gun shot]
Do what we say so is waitin on Yayo
So we can double back and give the fans what they paid for
Ever since the game came back to reality
These Niggas that ain't sellin, they mad at me, but had at me
Then, I take it right back tha' block
And Tennessee, we known to put tha' pirates on the pot

[Chorus]

[young buck]
Banks got me Jamican queens showin' dem around
We about to bounce from Brooklyn den head up town
The first down south nigga getting popping on the east coast
Like I dun want ????? I'm from the streets hoe
Gotta keep my heat cloaked just incase we bump headz
I'm goin backside with a gunshot, shell spray
Fuck what they say, G-unit's is in dis bitch
With four assault rifles and 6 ?million? clips
Bulletproof beam parked outside da club
So we can shoot at ya'll, but u can't shoot at us
My westcoast niccas get ur bang on to diz
If u ain't throwin' up ur hood, den u dun belong in diz bitch
One tyme for big pac, two times for tupac
Stuff tha shit out of a nigga ina G-unit Reebok
I've been "patiently waiting" while niggas was hating
I'm trying to keep count all this fucking money I'm makin
Bitch!
[50cent Chorus]
