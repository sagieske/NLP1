Song:

Could It be sunstroke making the way you rope me into conversation so wrong
Like playing darts with man with no hands, it's easy I mean
I guess I'm easy it seems.
You've got your problems and I've got mine
Let's learn to cope one drink at a time
You've got your problems

So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for

Bathe in the hot, hot sun
Bathe in the hot, hot sun

Could it be that I'm a little unclean
That the worst of my senses have grown extra keen
Could it be that I'm a little unfed
That I'm noticing more and more space in my bed

You've got your problems and I've got mine
Lets learn to cope one drink at a time
You've got your problems

So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for

You've got your problems and I've got mine
The suns giving us cancer all of the time
You've got your problems and I've got mine
Lets learn to cope one drink at a time
You've got your problems
Lets make you mine

So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
So relax lock the door
Think about what we start young for
