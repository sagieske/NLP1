[Verse:]
We have all the n***a kido
Push it out their motherfucking mind
Make a n***a drop it down
P***y n***a know I never slip
I pop it all the time
Let a n***a politic it up
Twelve make you spill line
N***a know I'm banging in New York
Phone by the stinky get butt now

Can you pretend?
Can you make it sound real?
N***a Joan riding on booth
Packing with the long grease (???)
Giddy by the wife, give a test
N***a, you will never get a deal
Check out how I follow all the fun
He doesn't know wait out on the pill
You step in my lane,
I pass you like taxi
She love this from skylight (???)
I pop me three cough and a Charlie
We f*****g and right, there's no telling
Pop me one, more quessa,
I'm higher than sky and the lightnin'
But you gotta be silent
Girl, you know we in love
You keep some pushing on your mind, man
And I'm gon' have you take it all

[Hook:]
