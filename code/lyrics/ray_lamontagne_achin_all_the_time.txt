Song:

When you're falling fast for someone but you know it just ain't right
And will it's true but all we seem to do is fuss and fight
And woe some love is all that seems to get you through the night
You'll find your mind is achin' all the time, all the time
You'll find your mind is achin' all the time

I heard it said in order to receive one must give
So in my heart I always did believe that's how I lived
You came along and proved it wrong, time and time again
I find my mind is achin' all the time, all the time
I find my mind is achin' all the time

If you give your heart to one that don't know promise from pretend
You don't need your ma' to tell you how this story ends
She'll be fine and he'll be crying himself to sleep again
I find my mind is achin' all the time, all the time
I find my mind is achin' all the time

I find my mind is achin' all the time, all the time
I find my mind is achin' all the time
