Song:

Your smile,gets me every single time I see you
your eyes,take me away
I don't,really know what this is gonna lead to
but it's like,I'm floating in space

(pre-chorus)
You take me somewhere,I've never been before
there's a whole new place waitin'
when you open up the door

(chorus)
You're out of this world
I knew that you could make it
you didn't have to fake it
you're never coming down
(chorus 2)
you're out of this world
you can't get any better
we're gonna last forever
keep your head up don't look down

You're out of this world
(out of this world)
out of this world
(out of this wold)

Proto Zoa:
The stars,droped down and up above our heads are fallin'
I know that wishes come true
