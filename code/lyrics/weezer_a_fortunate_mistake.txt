Song:

I tried and I failed
I tried and I failed
It was the best thing that could have happened
There's nothing left here
Nothing to care for
No one to talk with
No one to listen

I tried and I failed
I tried and I failed
It was the best thing
That could have happened
Too bad you find it all so impressive
Too bad you see it as something precious

I tried and I failed
I tried and I failed
It was the best thing
That could have happened
There's nothing left here
Nothing to care for
No one to talk with
No one to listen
