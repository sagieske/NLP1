Song:

My momma said to stay away from guys like you...
She said they were nasty, make me do things I don't wanna do...
Stay away from bad boys, they've got one thing on their mind...
Their hormones are raging... And they want it all the time!!

Chorus:
And I know, know cuz she said so
And I can't just let you go
And I know, know cuz she said so
And I can't just let you go

I love you very much, you're nice to see and nice to touch
And I'll never ever ever treat you wrong,
I've been waiting for you all along

Chorus:
And I know, know cuz she said so
And I can't just let you go
And I know, know cuz she said so
And I can't just let you go

Never let go. Never let go. I said I want you to know.
I said I want you to know right now. I want you to know
I said I want you to know......
