Song:

Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning;
This need that you and you alone create.
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams,
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire.
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning;
One kiss is all that I need to seal my fate,
And, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land.
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally,
If you will be my love.

Be my love, for no one else can end this yearning;
This need that you and you alone create.
Just fill my arms the way you've filled my dreams,
The dreams that you inspire with ev'ry sweet desire.
Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning;
One kiss is all that I need to seal my fate,
And, hand-in-hand, we'll find love's promised land.
There'll be no one but you for me, eternally,
If you will be my love.
