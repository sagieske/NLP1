Song:

I don't know why I love you
But I do
I don't know why I cry so
But I do

I only know I'm lonely
And that I want you only
I don't know why I love you
But I do

I can't sleep nights
Because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do
I feel so helpless

And since you went away
I cry both night and day
I don't know why I love you
But I do

My nights have been so lonely
My dayss have been so blue
I don't know how I manage
But I do

Each night I sit alone
And tell myself
That I will fall in love
With someone else

I guess I'm wasting time
But I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you
But I do

I don't know why I love you
But I do
