Song:

There's a girl across the street from me
I buried her son beneath a tree
I don't know why she's mad at me
He was stinking up my garage, you see

I met a cute boy, he liked my smile
We fell in love for a little while
He kissed me on the lips and it tasted sweet
So I chopped him into pieces and cooked his meat

Serial killers are people too
If you take away the voices I'm just like you
I'll hack you up and bury you in my yard
But why does making friends have to be so very hard?

I made a dress from a choir girl's skin
I wore it to church, the preacher said I'd sinned
Forgive me Father for my fashion crime
Your skin is so nice I'll use yours next time

Serial killers are people too
If you take away the voices I'm just like you
I'll hack you up and bury you in my yard
But why does making friends have to be so very hard?

La la la la la la la...
