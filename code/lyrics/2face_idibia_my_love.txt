(feat. Vip)

[Hook x2: Tuface Idibia]
Can you feel the sound
Vip and 2Face burn it down
Just to make you bounce along
Jump around, up and down
Baby, cool down
Don't wanna see you messing around
Don't wanna hear say you freaking around
Cuz you are my number one

[Chorus:]
My love is here to stay, won't go away
I promise to love you everyday
Oh ma cherie, no breaking me
Cuz I truly love you
And you are my number one

Listen

[Verse 1: Tuface Idibia]
Once upon a time, I met this lovely lady
It's amazing how she touched my soul
Uuh, I can't deny it
No, I can't describe it
Baby, I no fit shout e o
That's why I dedicate this one to you
Only just to let you know
Say you don dey make me colo
My heart just dey load dey go
Na only you I go dey follow follow
Listen, baby I say
Say you don dey make me colo
My heart just dey run dey go
Na only you I go dey follow follow

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Prodigal
What kind of girl wey make love dey be so
What kind of girl wey make love dey djoum so
What kind of girl wey make love dey sweet so
This girl be nice o, I met her for disco
Whilst we be dancing, we be chatting
We be laughing, we be hugging, we be drinking
We be hmm hmm hmm kissing
I met this girl the right time (right time)
She blow my mind the right time (right time)
She freak me out the right time (right time)
Me and this girl wey we go die
I'm in love with this girl, who wanna know why
Promzy
I promise on my honour to be faithful and loyal
To my baby girl, the best in the whole world
I pledge myself to her service
With all my heart, and strength and soul (oh oh)
I promise to hold in my high esteem
The love she has for me through all this hustling and jostling
And I promise to defend the good girl my wifey wifey
So help me God

[Chorus:]

Looking in my eyes, I know you can tell
