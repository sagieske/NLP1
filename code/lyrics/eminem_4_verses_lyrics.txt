Song:

I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin

I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym

I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias

To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens

A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium

Than a maniac Saudi Arabian

A highly combustible head, spazmatic

Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed

Laid up in the hospital in critical condition

I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician

High speed, iv full of thai weed

Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese

Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians

Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins

I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends

On if I keep on killin my girlfriends

(Yo!)

Last night I O. D. 'd on rush, mushrooms and dust

And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed (don't fall)

(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say

I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play

I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day

Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (don't fall) (Rrarrrrh)

Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin

Medicine'll get me revvin like (ohhh) a 747 jet engine

Scratched my balls til I shredded skin

" Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"

" It's probably aids!" Forget it then

I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows

That don't even make sense, like dykes usin d****s

So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats

And pick up this Slim Shady s**t that's on Rawkus

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out

Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)

Climbed out of a nice house,

Through the front window and heard this guy shout

" Hey that's my couch, heyyyy!"

Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout

While I'm rippin this s**t, put a clip in it spit five rounds

And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible

Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down

You're tied down and duct-taped, f**k rape

I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved

And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys

Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg

Snatched it off and beat him over the f*****g head with the peg

Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40

Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D

F**k an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead

Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead

No more said case closed end of discussion

I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion

Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas

Cross the bombas

We blowin up your house killing your parents

And coming back to get your foster mommas

And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus

Cause I aint making no more threats

I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets

I'm more or less sick in the head

Maybe more cause I smoked crack

Today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath

Walk the block with a labrador

Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador

Foul style galore

Verbal cow manure

Coming together like the eyebrow on Al (cut)
