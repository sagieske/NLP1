Song:

Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure
Asking for the level where a world devides it's answers
To the gang lords of evil life, they can't show you how
Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting
There is a reason for this being
Look upon this place as just a part of all that is
It is a spiritual part of being

Live within the power, you can be the strength it is
Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is
To give, to live, this hope, comes through
It takes the trust to agree this agreement
Live for the breaking free
Live for the breaking freedom
Just let it
Come
Through
Come
Through
