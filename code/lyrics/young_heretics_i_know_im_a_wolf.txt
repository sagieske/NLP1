Song:

Dear rabbit my legs are getting weak chasing you
The snow fields wouldn't seem so big if you knew
That this blood on my teeth it is far beyond dry
And I've captured you once but I wasn't quite right
So I'm telling you that you'll be safe with me.

Rabbit my claws are dull now so don't be afraid
I could keep you warm as long as you can just try to be brave
Yes I know I'm a wolf and I've been known to bite
But the rest of my pack I have left them behind
And my teeth may be sharp and I've been raised to kill
But the thought of fresh meat it is making me I'll
So I'm telling you that you'll be safe with me.

So rabbit please stop looking the other way
It's cold out there so why not stay here
Under my tail.
