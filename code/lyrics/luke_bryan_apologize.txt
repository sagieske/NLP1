Song:

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

Chorus
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

Chorus

I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
