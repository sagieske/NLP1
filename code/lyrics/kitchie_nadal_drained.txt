Song:

And when she woke, she shook the dreams that bound her tightly to her bed.
She cleaned it all. Tidied up and cut the cobwebs inside her head.
Clinging on to frays of comfort what has she thrown away?
Two lives incinerated drained. Nothing left to give now.
And there she walked. She came upon a tree, where their lips first kissed.
A thunderbolt and then the sound frightened the birds from their nest.
Clinging on to frays of comfort what has she thrown away?
Two lives incinerated drained. Nothing left to give now.
Clinging on to frays of comfort what has she thrown away?
Two lives incinerated drained. Nothing left to give now.
