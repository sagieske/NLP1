Song:

Your gentle means
And all seems to commence
A brand new pace in me
Hope it's not a blunder
Especially when I uncover
Dig deeper
And I wonder

When I get near you
I feel something deep within me
You know you bring me to new heights
I'm like a big balloon filled with hot air
Ready to explode
Each and every time I kissed you

The more I'm with you
The more it feels like
This could be the beginning of something wonderful
Yeah, yeah...

Your lips are movin'
Your voice is so oh, so soothin'
You wear a face that lives in my dreams
Where did you come from
And I wonder

When I get near you
I feel something deep within me
You know you bring me to new heights
I'm like a big balloon filled with hot air
Ready to explode
Each and every time I kissed you

The more I'm with you
The more it feels like
This could be the beginning of something wonderful
Yeah, yeah...

This could be the beginning of something really wonderful...
