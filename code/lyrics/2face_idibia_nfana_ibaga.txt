Echo Yeah
I'm coming out straight this time
I'm coming out with a little piece of my own kind of piece of mind
I'm doing it my way this time
Liek I'm not gonna bore you with some flimsy kind of piece of rhymne
So pull a cushion, sit back relax and listen
To this introduction of me, myself and my mission
My vision is to let you all see
That there's more to this life than just faking up reality

I wake up in the morning and I stretch out my feet
Say a thank you prayer then I brush up my teeth
A little exercise then I grab something to eat
Put on a piece of clothing and then step out into the street
The into the studio just to hook up some beat
Later to the club to make the people feel the heat
Make an honest living and I'm proud about it
Making sure that all my mistakes I don't repeat
Like I mind my own business and I don't give a s**t
I say whats on my mind I don't have time to edit
Got to thank the Lord that He's helped me find my feet
Oh praise the Lord he give me power to defeat
If you give me stoneness they got to give me meat
I try to find it and I try to forget it
Everybody know that me too lazy to quit
Everybody know that me physically fit
Everybody know that me humble and cool
But some poeple them take me for a fool

Nfana Ibaga
Never give another one yawawo
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is that I got my conscience by my side
Got piece of mind inside
Nfana Ibaga
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is who has this, no man can curse
No man can curse
No man can curse

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I got to be strong, got to be ready for the strife
I know some people will say somethings that will cut like a knife
I know some people will say that I might never find a wife
But I'll do my thing my way oh my brother no be fight
Sometimes I might be wrong sometimes I might be right
But I'll keep my head straight
And I'll keep my game tight
'Cause what I can't see is the future where the pride
Got to have it all not just the vine
Got to have it all not by power not by might
But I can squeeze the cup by day and by night
And the Almighty Lord He never let me leave His sight
But upon on top of that I still will do my peope right
So I promise I go use my music to dey shine the light
I no go comform I say I know the sight
I go bear my mind I go bear am black and white
Just because I say I no finish school
Some people them they take me for a fool

Nfana Ibaga
Never give another one yawawo
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is that I got my conscience by my side
Got piece of mind inside
Nfana Ibaga
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is who has this, no man can curse
No man can curse

So I say welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Me I get plenty things to talk about yeah
I say me I get plenty things to yawn about yeah
No man can curse

Nfana Ibaga
Never give another one yawawo
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is that I got my conscience by my side
Got piece of mind inside
Nfana Ibaga
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga
Is who has this, no man can curse
No man can curse
No man can curse

Who God has placed no man can curse
