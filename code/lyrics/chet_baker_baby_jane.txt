Song:

Baby Jane don't leave me hanging on the line
I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in high society
Don't forget
I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side but now
I'm no longer sure
I wish I knew what
I know now before
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
Baby Jane don't it make you feel sad just when
I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times the situation ain't all that new Optimism's my best defense
I'll get through without you
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
I won't be that dumb again I know it's gotta last forever
When I fall in love again I know it's gonna last forever
Baby Jane
I've said all I want to say go your own way don't think twice about me
Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own so long darlin'
I'll miss you believe me
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow but
I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry
When I give my heart again I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when I know it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time I know it's gonna last forever
I won't be that dumb again I know it'll last forever
