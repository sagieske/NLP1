Song:

Another Saturday nigt and I ain't got nobody
I have some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in awful mess
I blew in town 1 week ago, I ain't seen a lotta girls since then
If I could find'em I could get'em but as yet I have'nt met'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in ohhhh
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I have some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in awful mess
Another fella told me he had a sister that looked so fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strong resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein ohhhh....
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I have some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in awful mess
It's hard for a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I can't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town ohhh....
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I have some money 'cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in awful mess
