Song:

I can't help it if I don't feel so good
I can't help it if I don't feel so good
If I had my way
I'd be sitting on the top of the world
I can't help it if I don't feel so good
When the anger comes in him
There's no place for a man to hide
When the anger comes in him
There's no place for a man to hide
Would he do anything in the world
To make him feel better inside
When the anger comes in him
There's no place for a man to hide
Gonna sit back here
Gonna watch this cloud roll by
The next time that you see me
I should be shining like the fourth of july
Gonna sit back here
Gonna watch this cloud roll by

I ain't lookin' for details
Won't you just give me a clue
Oh lord what am I gonna do
