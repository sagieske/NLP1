Song:

Ain't gonna do the gig tonight
With the band

I'm going out of town tonight
Oh yes I am

Sorry fans
Sorry band
I couldn't keep my promise
I'll put on my coat and hit the road

Chorus:
Breaking up
Breaking out
I am leaving now you can sing it loud

Have to stop
Had enough
Crying tough

Quit the race
Give me space
Cos I'm so tired of being a slave
When I'm going
I'll sing a different song

There's gonna be no wedding on
Saturday

I will be on my way then
So far away

Sorry mom
Sorry honey
I couldn't keep me promise
I'll ripp off my tie and say goodbye

Chorus:
Breaking up
Breaking out
I am leaving now you can sing it loud

Have to stop
Had enough
Crying tough

Quit the race
Give me space
Cos I'm so tired of being a slave
When I'm going
I'll sing a different song
