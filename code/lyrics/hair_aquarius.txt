Song:

When the moon is in the seventh house
And jupiter aligns with mars
The peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of aquarius
The age of aquarius

Aquarius
Aquarius

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystals revelations
And the minds true liberation

Aquarius
Aquarius

When the moon is in the seventh house
And jupiter aligns with mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the age of aquarius
The age of aquarius
