Song:

Come down jesus
And look at what you'll see
A lot of concrete
Where every news could be

Cdme down jesus
Come down I pray
You won' t believe
All the things you'll see today

Come down jesus
And look at common man
He is illness, disease unto this land

Come down jesus
Come down I pray
You won't believe
All the things you'll see today

Come down jesus
Oh come down lord
Won't you help clean the land
Of the fire and the sword
Come down jesus
Oh come and see the sights
Big buildings and electric lights
Little children who haven't had a bite
Come down jesus
And tell me do you think this is right
Come down lord

Come down jesus
And look at modern man
Human cancer created by your hand

Come down jesus
Come down I pray
You won't believe
All the things you'll see today
