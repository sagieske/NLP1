Song:

There's nothin' like a woman's love
For a man when he's lonesome and blue
If your loved carressed by a woman
If you need her be thankful you do.

Remind her you need her forever
Be true and don't drive her away
For you'll need the love of a woman
At the close of each long dreary day.

--- Instrumental ---

There's nothin' like a woman's love
For a man when the long day is through
If you have a chance to be unfaithful
No doubt she has had them too.

Her heart will know if your faithful
For if you found a love young and new
There's nothin' like a womans love
So be thankful your love can be true...
