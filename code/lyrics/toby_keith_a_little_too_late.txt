Song:

[chorus]
It�s a little too late
I�m a little too gone,
A little too tired of this hangin� on
So I�m letting go while I�m still strong enough to
It�s got a little too sad
I�m a little too blue
It�s a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I�m big time over you baby
It�s a little too late

No I don�t want to want to talk about what we can do about us anymore
Only time you and me wastin� is the time it takes to walk right out that door
Yeah talk about water under the bridge,
You should know by now girl that�s all this is

[chorus]
It�s a little too late,
I�m a little too gone,
A little too tired of just hangin� on
I�m letting go while I�m still strong enough to
It�s got a little too sad,
I�m a little too blue
It�s a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I�m big time over you baby
It�s a little too late

There was a time,
This heart of mine,
Would take you back every time
Don�t you know
It�s been two packs of cigaretts
A sleepless night
A nervous wreck, a day ago.
Now you ain�t got no business coming around
I�m closing up shop
Shuttin� us down

[chorus]
It�s a little too late,
I�m a little too gone,
A little too tired of just hangin� on
I�m letting go while I�m still strong enough to
It�s got a little too sad,
I�m a little too blue
It�s a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I�m big time over you baby
It�s a little too late
I�m big time over you baby,
It�s a little too late
