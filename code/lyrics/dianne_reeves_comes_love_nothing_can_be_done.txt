Song:

Comes a rain storm, put rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don’t try hiding 'cause there isn’t any use
You’ll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a heat wave, you can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes the measles, you can quarantine the room
Comes a mouse, you can chase him with a broom
Comes love, nothing can be done

That’s all brother, if you’ve ever been in love
That’s all sister, you know what I’m thinking of

Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you might get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done
