Song:

I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a f**k
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

2, 3, 4!

Remember when I tried?
I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through

But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Cause I'm what's always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a f**k
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

Cause no one can understand
I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans

So now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Cause I'm what's always wrong

I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a f**k
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town

My world cannot ever bring me down
Gave everything I had to turn it back around
Cause our time's worth something
Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I gotta do this right, then they can't make a sound
Cause I'm not here for nothing
Least I can say I stand for something

(You and me, we stand for something)

I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a f**k
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?

And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
