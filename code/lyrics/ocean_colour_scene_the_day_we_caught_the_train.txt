Song:

I never saw it as the start it's more a change of heart
Rapping on the windows, whistling down the chimney pot blowing off the
Dust in the room where I forgot I laid my plans in solid rock
Stepping through the door like a troubadour whiling just an hour away
Looking at the trees on the roadside feeling it's a holiday.
You and I should ride the coast and wind up in our
Favourite coats just miles away.
Roll a number write another song like Jimmy heard the day he caught the train.

He sipped another rum and coke and told a dirty joke.
Walking like Groucho sucking on a number 10.
Rolling on the floor with the cigarette burns walked in,

I'll miss the crush and I'm home again.
Stepping through the door with the night in store whiling just an hour away,
Step into the sky in the starbright feeling it's a brighter day.

You and I should ride the tracks and find ourselves just wading through
Tomorrowand you and I when we're coming down we're only getting back
And you know I feel no sorrow.
When you find that things are getting wild don't you need days like these.
