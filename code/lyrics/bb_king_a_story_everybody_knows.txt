Song:

Went to a party
The New York style
I met a lady
Make a sane man wild
She said the words only her lips could say
She made me want to throw my life away
But when I asked her
She said "Maybe tomorrow, B.B."
And that's a story everybody knows

I took her flying
Out across the sea
I thought I had her
I know that she had me
And when we landed
It was Paris, France
Seemed like a nice place
For some French romance
But when I touched her
She said "Maybe a little later, B.B."
And that's the story everybody knows

We went to Berlin
And to Stockholm too
And on the Moscow
Then to the Peking Zoo
As far as travel, she couldn't get too much
Somewhere in Oakland
She let me have just a little touch
And then she said "I'm late for beauty appointment,
I've got a headache, And I believe I'm coming down with the flu"
And that's the story everybody knows
