Song:

Sometimes I wish that I could stop the clock from turning.
And spend the weekend lost inside your eyes.
Somehow I wish that I could hug the roses burning,
Til I can make you mine.
From the first time I saw you at that coffee shop on Melrose. They were
Playing Hey Jude and we both sang along. Could have talked forever had a
Thousand cups of coffee, I hated that my flight was taking off.
And if I had the time, and I could live a different life.
And if this plane would fly over the California sky.
I'd be with you tonight Oh Oh, I'd be with you tonight Oh Oh.
I put my headphones on and went right to the Beatles, Looked out the window
Saw your face amongst the stars.
Didn't ask in London, and I wonder if you'd been here, And if you know you
Caught my heart.
From the first time I saw you at that coffee shop on Melrose, With your
Skinny black jeans and your long blonde hair.
Could have talked forever had a thousand cups of coffee.
Instead of being ten thousand feet above nowhere.
And if I had the time, and I could live a different life.
And if this plane would fly over the California sky.
I'd be with you tonight Oh Oh, I'd be with you tonight Oh Oh.
I want to take you up to Malibu, I wanna hold your hand in Griffith Park, I
Wanna dance with you in Hollywood, And kiss your lips under the stars.
And if I had the time, and I could live a different life. And if this plane
Would fly over the California sky. I'd be with you tonight Oh, I'd be with
You tonight Oh Oh. I'd be with you tonight Oh Oh, I'd be with you tonight.
I'd be with you tonight.
