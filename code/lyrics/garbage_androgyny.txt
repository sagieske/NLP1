Song:

When everything is going wrong
And you can't see the point of going on
Nothing in life is set in stone
There's nothing that can't be turned around

Nobody wants to be alone
Everybody wants to love someone
Out of the tree go pick a plum
Why can't we all just get along

Boys
Boys in the girls' room
Girls
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys
Boys in the parlor
Girls
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind in your androgyny

No sweeter a taste that you could find
Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine
There's never been an oyster so divine
A river deep that never runs dry

What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need
What you need

The birds and the bees they hum along
Like treasure they twinkle in the sun
Get on board and have some fun
Take what you need to turn you on

Boys
Boys in the girls' room
Girls
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys
Boys in the parlor
Girls
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind
I'll free your

Boys
Behind closed doors and under stars
Girls
It doesn't matter where you are
Boys
Collecting jewels that catch your eyes
Girls
Don't let a soulmate pass you by

Boys in the girls' room
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys in the parlor
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind

Boys in the girls' room
Girls in the men's room
You free your mind in your androgyny
Boys in the parlor
They're getting harder
I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind
I'll free your mind
I'll free your
