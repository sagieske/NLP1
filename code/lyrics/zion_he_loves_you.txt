Song:

For too long you've been lied to
Been told that sin is O. K.
But it's talkin' you down, it's talkin' you down
There's really a better way
Listen, got something to tell you
Ya don't have to pay the price
Jesus paid it for you
You don't have to gamble your life
'Cause Jesus Loves  He Loves You
Jesus Loves  He Loves You
Jesus Loves
I'm sick of hearing these lies
Sayin' Hell is O. K.
It's not the truth
It will burn you night and day
But Jesus can save you
He's the only One who can bring you through
So don't ride the Highway to Hell
You really weren't made to
C'mon don't mess around
You're playing with your soul
Don't you know you go on forever
But you decide now where to go
Give it up to Him
Your gift is Eternal Life, Give it up to Jesus
He paid the ultimate price
No sin is too heavy for Jesus to take away
Give it up to Him right now, He will change your life
