Song:

(Zac)
We're soaring, flying
There's not a
Star in heaven
That we can't reach

(Vanessa)
If we're trying
So we're
Breaking free

(Zac)
You know the world can see
Us, in a way
That's different
Than who we are

(Vanessa)
Creating space between us,
'Til we're separate hearts

(Both)
But your faith it
Gives me strength
Strength to believe

Chorus
We're breaking free
We're soaring, flying
There's not a star
In heaven
That we can't
Reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
Oh we're breaking

(Zac)
Can you feel it building
Like a wave
The ocean just
Can't control

(Vanessa)
Connected by a feeling
Ohhh,
With our very souls,

(Both)
Rising 'til it lifts us up

So everyone can see

Chorus
We're breaking free,
We're soaring, flying
There's not a
Star in heaven that we can't reach

(Zac)
If were trying

(Both)
Yeah were breaking free
Running, climbing
Get to the place
To be what we can be
Now's the time
So we're breaking free
Ohh yeah

(Zac)
More than hope
More than faith

(Vanessa)
This is truth
This is faith

(Both)
And together we see it coming
Not a want but a need
Both of us breaking free

Soaring,
Flying
There's not a
Star in heaven that
We can't reach
If we're trying
Yeah we're breaking free
We're running oh
Climbing to get to the
Place to be all that we can be
Now's the time
So we're breaking free

(Both)
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different
Then who we are...
