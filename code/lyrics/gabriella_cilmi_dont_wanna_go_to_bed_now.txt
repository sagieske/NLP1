Song:

I know you'll think it's right
If you see inside my mind
It's summer everyday
And it's music through the night

I know you'd think it's fine
If you free your state of mind
Some might say it's strange
But the bullets worth a bite

Ooh waiting, waiting baby
Ooh waiting, waiting baby

And I, I don't wanna go to bed now
I wanna be indiscreet
I don't wanna got to bed now
Bed now, not now, no

And I, I don't wanna have to beg now
That's sellin' my soul too cheap
I don't wanna go to bed now
Bed now, not now, no

I feel it in my feet
And I feel it in my bones
My heels dug in so deep
Need a truck to drag me home

I know you feel it too
Through the faces in the crowd
It's only me and you
And some good stuff going down

Ooh waiting, waiting baby
Ooh waiting, waiting baby

You look good, look good
You're good looking, yeah
You look good, good, good
You're good looking, yeah

You look good, look good
You're good looking, yeah
You look good, good, good
You're good looking, yeah

And I, I don't wanna go to bed now
I wanna be indiscreet
I don't wanna got to bed now
Bed now, not now, no

And I, I don't wanna have to beg now
That's sellin' my soul too cheap
I don't wanna go to bed now
Bed now, not now, no

You look good, look good
You're good looking, yeah
You look good, good, good
You're good looking, yeah

You look good, look good
You're good looking, yeah
You look good, good, good
You're good looking, yeah
