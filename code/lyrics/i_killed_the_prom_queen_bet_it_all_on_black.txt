Song:

You wore out your welcome, like you wore me, to the bone.
Outside the mood is absent and silence provides no solace.
I offer no shelter from the dead night air.
Just a tomb to call your own.
In this falling fortress.
Awake me from this broken dream.
Your god won't lead you through today.
He only hears your cries as a chorus to a lullaby.
Your faith has fallen before your eyes.
A mindless cage that keeps you suffocated and on your knees, lonely, wanting more.
He preaches another love song, temporarily blinded by lies.
You taken beauty from these words.
Rewrite your own mind in this war.
You wore out your welcome like you wore me down.
You are an image without form.
... And in this moment my heart collapsed...
You smashed it apart.
He preaches another love song, temporarily blinded by lies.
Everything you hold in your heart is frail.
Everything you love will pass away.
Everything you hold in your heart is frail.
It will perish in a wall of flames.
