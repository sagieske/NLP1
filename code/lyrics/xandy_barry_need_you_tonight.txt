Song:

Your skin is always on my mind
My body's trembling all my blood is racing blind
It's never been so dangerous
The things you do to me
Everytime we...
Touch I should just run but
I can't fight it anymore

I need you tonight
Wrap your aching arms around me
Hold me so tight and
Never let me go until you say
All the words that you didn't today
When you left me here this way
I don't care if I'm wrong or I'm right
I just need you
I need your s** tonight

This fever never goes
The scars you left inside
Remind me everyday
I've never felt so lost and free
Take anything you want
Anything from... Me
I should just run but
I can't fight it anymore

I need you tonight
Wrap your aching arms around me
Hold me so tight and
Never let me go until you say
All the words that you didn't today
When you left me here this way
I don't care if I'm wrong or I'm right
I just need you
I need your s** tonight
