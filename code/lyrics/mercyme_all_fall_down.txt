Song:

Your Word Oh Lord is eternal
It stands firm
Your faithfulness continues through all the earth
All creation hangs on Your every word

[CHORUS:]
With the sound of Your voice
Water still, You are Lord over all
With the touch of Your robe, sick are healed
For You Jesus we all fall down

My soul finds rest and comfort
From only You
My fortress and my rock
I won't be moved
You are my cornerstrone, who's love endures

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made
And I praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made

[CHORUS (2x)]

We fall down, we fall down
