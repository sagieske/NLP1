Song:

We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
In the name of manifest destiny, you and me, you and me, you and me

They made us many promises but always broke their word
They penned us in like buffalo, drove us like a herd
And finally on the reservation where we'd gone for our preservation, we were all wiped out by the seventh cavalry

You and me, you and me

We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
In the name of manifest destiny, you and me, you and me, you and me

Now we make our promises, we won't break our word
We'll sing, sing, sing out our story 'til the truth is heard
There's a whole new generation Braves who dream of veneration who were not wiped out by the seventh cavalry

You and me, you and me

We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
We were all wounded at Wounded Knee, you and me
We were all wounded by Wounded Knee
