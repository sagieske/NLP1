Song:

Your accused of the following charges
You're a woman trapped inside of a man
Your sexuality no one denies you
But your preference we can't understand
You are the lonliness of all people

It's time for you to realize
Aids like the plague is from god
For he see's something wrong in his eyes

Analy inflicted death sentence
A. I. D. S
Analy inflicted death sentence
A. I. D. S
Analy inflicted death sentence
A. I. D. S
Analy inflicted death sentence
A. I. D. S

That's what you get for having
A p**** up your a**
You should have used a condom
That's what you get when you
Swallow another man's load
A lubricated condom

How do you find love in another man's hairy a**
You should have used a condom
Millions of lost hampsters
Running ramped in your bowels
Take the hershey highway

Fudge packing man

Fudge packing man
Fudge packing man
A manly man
Fudge packing man
Fudge packing man
Fudge packing man
