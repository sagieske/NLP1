Song:

Every time that someone walks in
She turns around to see if it’s him
She checks her watch by the clock
I can’t count the times he’s stood her up
And one’s too much

How could anybody break a heart like hers
I can’t stand to watch her hurt
I would gladly take his place if she’d just love me that way
He must not know what it’s worth
I don’t understand how anyone could break a heart like hers

She keeps saying he’ll change someday
He wasn’t always this way
She thinks he hung the moon and stars
But all he’s done is string her along like this
It don’t make sense

How could anybody break a heart like hers
I can’t stand to watch her hurt
I would gladly take his place if she’d just love me that way
He must not know what it’s worth
I don’t understand how anyone could break a heart like hers

How could anybody break a heart like hers
