Song:

Get up and dance to the music
Get on up and dance to the fonky music
Dance to the music, dance to the music

Hey Greg, what?
All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet

I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide
You might like to hear my organ
Playing 'Ride Sally Ride'

You might like to hear the horns blowin'
Cynthia on the throne, yeah
Cynthia and Jerry got a message they're sayin'
All the squares, go home
Dance to the music, dance to the music
