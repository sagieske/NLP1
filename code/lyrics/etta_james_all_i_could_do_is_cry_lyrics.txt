Song:

I heard church bells ring
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger he placed a ring

Oooh oh

I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise
Til death do us part
Each word
Was a pain
In my heart

All I could do was cry
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry

And now the wedding is over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them life has just begun
But mine is ending

Ooh

All I could do was cry
All I could do was cry
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry
