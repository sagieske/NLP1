Song:

Do you feel the thorns?
Do you see the tears?
Do you see the bloodshed in this fell war?

Have you forsaken us?
Have you forgotten our faithful men calling your name?

While I stand before you
While we perish
While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men
Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

In your nemeton
These grey stone walls are cold and silent 
As the fallen mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams
Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

Epo, Epo, why has thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people

Were you there?
Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand's turning old and weak
I'm giving myself upon to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

Falling on me...
