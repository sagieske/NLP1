Song:

Welcome friends
To seconds lost, and to starts that won't begin
To twisted eyes that see inside
Rules that always bend
A simple task, a see-through mask
That questions where and why
We shared our skin to occupy, and keep our piece of mind

Bring only what you need to survive
They burn an image from lines on my face
They stole it from the pages that kept my place
I stand on the outside, would die to get in
I crawl inside just to begin again

It's so unfair
This broken smile that keeps us all aware
Of wishful thoughts, and scenes we lost
And times we'll never share
I'll ask you now to show me how
To fill the circle in
What tells us all?
There is no fall, and the story never ends

Bring only what you need to survive
They burn an image from lines on my face
They stole it from the pages that kept my place
I stand on the outside, would die to get in
I crawl inside just to begin again

They never loved
They never cared
I wished you'd understand
I'm already dead
What would you be
Why would you die
How could you lie
Take something from me
(they burn an image)
They took it from me
(they burn an image)
They took it from me
(image)
They stole it from me
Image
Image

They burn an image from lines on my face
They stole it from the pages that kept my place
I stand on the outside, would die to get in
I crawl inside just to begin again
They burn an image from lines on my face
They stole it from the pages that kept my place
I stand on the outside, would die to get in
I crawl inside just to begin again
