Song:

Take my chances, rather go to jail
Than see the eyes of a coward runnin' loose and well
He don't care, he couldn't give a damn
Deprived of his victim, he's a ruthless man
He waits in the shadows 'til the man is gone
He moves to the door, now she's all alone
Far as you could see, that's her only way
She fears for her life and what her family would say

[Chorus:]
Back door stranger
A fair warning he's out tonight
A back door stranger
We gotta stop him if the chance is right

You read in the paper, most any day
'Bout back door stranger and his evil ways
The law can't judge because he pleads insane
It's a sign of the times that we got to change
You ask my opinion, he ain't half a man
He's as cold as a snake about to strike again
It's a slap in the face that we tolerate
The pain that he causes worries us grey

[Chorus:]

Take my chances, rather go to jail
Than see the eyes of a coward runnin' loose and well
He don't care, he couldn't give a damn
Deprived of his victim, he's a ruthless man
You ask my opinion, got to make a stand
He's cold as a snake, gonna strike again
It's a slap in the face that we tolerate
The pain that he causes, it worries us grey

(Chorus Twice)
