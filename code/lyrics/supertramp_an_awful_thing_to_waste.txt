Song:

So maybe you could do with a break
You've had about all you can take
You need to find somewhere you can run to

Somewhere a long way from here
Somewhere where the skies are all clear
Somewhere you can think all your thoughts through
It took a long time to make me understand
You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand
You gotta use your emotion

You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease
You want to sit back and count your memories
But that's no solution

I don't want to harp about it
But what you gonna do about it?

Look at how you're set in your ways
You used to be so willing to face
Any find of problem before you

Life is not as long as you think
Open up your mind and you'll see
Don't destroy yourself I implore you

You've got a fine wife, a perfect family
You had it all planned to live so carefully
But where does it get you

They say the mind is an awful thing to waste
And that's a fact that you must come to face
What more can I tell you?
