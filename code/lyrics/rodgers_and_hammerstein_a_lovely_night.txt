Song:

Cinderella: (spoken)
I imagine that there's a grand staircase,
Candles everywhere, and an orchestra playing...

Minerva:
It looks that way

Calliope:
The way you say

Stepmother:
She talks as if she knows.

Cinderella:
I do not know that this is so
I only just suppose...
I suppose that when you come to the ballroom
And the room itself is floating in the air
If you're suddenly confronted by his highness
You are frozen like a statue on the stair
You're afraid he'll hear the way your heart is beating
And you know you mustn't make the first offense
You are seriously thinking of retreating
When you seem to hear him asking you to dance...
(spoken)
And when you waltz with him, you whirl around so that your feet never
Touch the floor...

Calliope:
That's right they don't!

Cinderella:
And it feels like you weigh nothing at all

Minerva:
That's right it does!

Cinderella:
And for a few precious moments, you're the only two people in the entire
World.
(sings)
A Lovely night, a lovely night
A finer night you know you'll never see
You meet your prince, a charming prince
As charming as a prince will ever be.
The stars in a hazy heaven
Tremble above you
While he is whispering:
"Darling I love you"
You say goodbye, away you fly
But on your lips you keep a kiss
All your life you'll dream of this
A Lovely, lovely night.

Minerva:
A Lovely night,

Calliope:
How lovely!

Minevra:
A lovely night

Calliope:
How lovely!

Minerva:
A finer night you know you'll never see

Calliope:
How lovely.

Minerva:
You meet...

Calliope:
Your prince,

Minerva:
A char-...

Calliope:
.. Ming prince.

Stepmother:
As charming as a prince will ever be.
The stars in a hazy heaven

Calliope:
Tremble above you

Stepmother:
While he is whispering:

Minerva:
"Darling I love you"

Cinderella:
You say goodbye, away you fly

Stepsisters:
But on your lips you keep a kiss

Stepmother:
All your life you'll dream of this

Cinderella:
Lovely,

Minerva:
Lovely,

Calliope:
Lovely

Stepsisters, Cinderella:
Lovely night
