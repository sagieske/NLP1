Song:

There's a little black dark scar tire divide
This is it, can you hear me?
Have you ever felt a shattered heart buried alive?
You can do almost anything

There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun with a lake
Recommends such a setting sight
And the thousands of stars come out thousands of times
We can go only if you believe, only if you believe

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it, can you hear me?
When you cry do your tears ever choke the room?
Calling out every moment of need

Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eyes?
Oh God, if a wish is too big to deny
I will offer a line and it's ready for use
Let me know are you ready for me?

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time

When the storm brings rain, snow, fate of all kinds
You can feel almost anything
When the day seems to melt, fall flat in the night
You can feel almost anything

When you can't get up, you gotta get up and try
This is it, can you feel me?
When the bombs come down, you will make it alive
If you only, if you wanna believe

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time, out of time

When I dream youâ€™re my only
When I dream I feel your heart
When I dream, I'm out of time
When I dream, I'm out of time

I feel your heart
I feel your heart
I feel your heart
I feel your heart

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time
