Song:

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Baby, I believe all you can achieve.
And all the doubt to the love you see.
No, I'm not scared.
Got me walking on air, feeling that I can do anything.

I let you take the heat.
But I, I jumped in with both my feet for a while.
I'm not scared.
Baby, I came, I came prepared. (Don't stop.)

Baby, I believe when you love, when you love, ooh ooh oh oh,
You know you gotta make it.
When you love and there's things going on in your life,
You're strong enough to make it.

Oh yeah.

Baby, I believe that when you love,
You open your mind and you learn to trust.
There will be mistakes.
But you do what it takes.
To get it right takes some sacrifice.

I let you take the heat.
But I, I jumped in with both my feet for a while.
I'm not scared.
Baby, I came, I came prepared.

Baby, I believe when you love, when you love, ooh ooh oh oh,
You know you gotta make it.
When you love and there's things going on in your life,
You're strong enough to take it.
When you love, when you love and you know that it's true,
It's gets a little crazy.

Anything that life throws at you,
It's hard when you're feeling blue.
Anything that life throws at you,
You know you will make it through.

Baby, I believe when you love, when you love, ooh ooh oh oh,
You know you gotta make it.
When you love and there's things going on in your life,
You're strong enough to take it.
When you love, when you love and you know that it's true,
It's gets a little crazy.

When you love.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
When you love.
When you love.
When you love.
When you love.
