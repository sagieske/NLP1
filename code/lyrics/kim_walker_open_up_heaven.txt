Song:

Verse 1:
When heaven opens, over me, I'm saturated in love,
Dancing deeper in creativity, nothing impossible for me.
Stirring passion, dreams awakened,
Heaven opened, is what I long to see!

Pre-chorus:
It's the promise I was made for, born for,
To see heaven open up on earth.
It's everything I'd fight for, I'd die for,
To see heaven invade this earth!

Chorus:
Open up heaven!
We will party with the angels.
There is nothin' better,
We're ready for encounters with You.

Verse 2:
Reformation, Transformation, Revolution,
It's our destiny.
A generation, designed to worship,
We have Jesus and his presence is all we need.

Bridge:
I live for Your presence,
You are life to my heart.
I live for Your presence,
From Your love I will never part.
