Song:

I wonder if I'll ever forget you
And if our love that's true ever dies
I can't forget the kisses you gave me
Or memories of your two baby blue eyes

I'll always keep a memory of you
Visions of eyes as blue as the sky
And that's why each night there's tears on my pillow
I'm dreaming of your two baby blue eyes

Now when day is done and shadows are fallen'
My love will sleep 'til morning sunrise
I lay awake just tossing and turning
I'm longing for dreams of baby blue eyes

Now day after day try to keep smiling
And a broken heart I try to disguise
Now night after night my lonely heart's calling
It's calling for you my baby blue eyes
