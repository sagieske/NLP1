Song:

Believe, when you lie
You will never need to recognize yourself
To deceive
To remove all chance of doubt and be received
With your lie
The deception is complete when you concede
And decide
To reject your lives, sacrificed to me

Penance can't absolve your sin, into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
All your belief cannot absolve your sin [x2]

Believe, when you lie
You will never need to recognize the source
Of deceit
To renew your faith in God
You must believe, in your lie
The redemption is complete when you conceive
And decline
To release your lives
Sacrificed to me

Penance can't absolve your sin, into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
All your belief cannot absolve your sin [x2]

Reap your life, like you want to recognize, all you've come to [x2]

Reap your life
Veiled in shadow
Recognize
Faces of the crucified
I can hear their screams tonight
Ever haunting me

Burn your lie into me

Penance can't absolve your sin, into me
Penance can't absolve your sin
All your belief cannot absolve your sin [x4]
