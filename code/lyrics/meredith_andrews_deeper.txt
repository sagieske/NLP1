Song:

I've been wading
In shallow water
You're the ocean
I am after
And I wanna go
Oh I wanna go with You

Break the silence
With Your whisper
Take my hand and
Pull me under
'Cuz I wanna go
Oh I wanna go with You

Take me deeper
Take me deeper
To where You are
That I may find You
Take me further
Take me further
Than where I've been
I wanna be with You
Be with You, oh

Settling for
What my eyes see
Help me believe
Help me break free
'Cuz I wanna go
Oh I wanna go with You

Take me deeper
Take me deeper
To where You are
That I may find You
Take me further
Take me further
Than where I've been
I wanna be with You
Be with You, oh

Take me through the desert places
For the chance to see Your face
Take me past the breaking waves
Into the depth of Your embrace

Take me deeper
Take me deeper
To where You are
That I may find You
Take me further
Take me further
Than where I've been
I wanna be with You

Take me deeper
Take me deeper
To where You are
That I may find You
Take me further
Take me further
Than where I've been
I wanna be with You
Be with You, oh
