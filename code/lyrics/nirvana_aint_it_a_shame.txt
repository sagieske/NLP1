Song:

Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
When you got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Oh Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to have a drink on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to have a drink on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to have a drink on Sunday
When you got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Oh Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Ain't it a shame

Ain't it a shame to beat your wife on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to beat your wife on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to beat your wife on Sunday
When you got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Oh Thursday, Friday, Saturday

Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it a shame to go fishin on a Sunday
When you got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Oh Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Ain't it a shame
Ain't it shame
Ain't it
Ain't it Shame
Shame
Shame
Shame
