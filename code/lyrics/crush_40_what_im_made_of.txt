Song:

I don't care what you're thinking
As you turn to me
Cos what I have in my two hands
Is enough to set me free
-Set me free-

I could fight the feeling to resist it over time
But when it's just too much to take you sneak from behind

Is it me, you said, you're looking for?
Let me show you who I am
And what I'm here for, here for

Hey!

Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now

Like a million faces
I've recognised them all
One by one they've all become
A number as they fall
-As they fall-

In the face of reason
Oh I can't take no more
One by one they've all become
A black mark on the floor

Is it me -Is it me?-
You said -You said?-
You're looking for?
Let me show you who I am
And what I have in store, in store

Hey! Hey! Yeah!

Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now

You can take another lifelong try
You can take another try
Hey!

(Guitar solo)

Yeah!
Try to reach inside of me
Try to drain my energy
Let me show you just
What I'm made of
Simple curiosity
Try to take a bite of me
Let me show you just
What I'm made of now

Yeah, try to reach inside of me -Show you what I'm made of-
Let me show you just -Show you what I'm made of-
What I'm made of
