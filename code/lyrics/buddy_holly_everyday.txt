Song:

Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

Everyone says go ahead and ask her,
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster,
Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

Every way, love's a little stronger,

Everyday seems a little longer,
True love from me?
Come what may, do you ever long for
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
Everyday, it's a gettin' faster,
Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)

Love like yours will surely c]ome my way, (hey, hey, hey)
Everyone says go ahead and ask her,
Everyday seems a little longer,

Every way, love's a little stronger,
Come what may, do you ever long for
Everyday, it's a gettin' closer,
True love from me?

Love like yours will surely come my way, (hey, hey, hey)
Goin' faster than a roller coaster,
Love like yours will surely come my way
