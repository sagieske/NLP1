Song:

[Verse 1:]
I know I said it, I know I did it,
Maybe I went overboard to prove a point.
But sometimes my pride gets in the way,
Maybe I need some time away to get my head together.

(Maybe this was my last chance)
(I don't ever want to take it for granted)
(I can say that I'm a better man, I'm sorry).

[Chorus:]
I'm so sorry that I chose to walk away from You,
And I'm sorry if I turned Your love away.
I didn't mean to take Your words
And make them seem so trite,
I sincerely, completely apologize for doing what I did.

[Verse 2:]
Everything You taught me and everything You showed me,
It never seemed that I would listen to anything.
But You've got my attention, more than You know,
I took it in, I dealt with it, but I waited too late to use it.

(Maybe this was my last chance)
(I don't ever want to take it for granted)
(I can say that I'm a better man, I'm sorry).

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I've never, ever been so shameful for what I did,
But You made me know one thing
(that I should have never did).

Will You please take me back again,
I never wanted to burn this bridge.
(If I could do it all over again),
I'll never mishandle You ever again.

[Chorus:]
