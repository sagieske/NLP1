Song:

Say you'll be my girlfriend
'Cause You know you'll never ever find a better man
Mi amore you're what I want
Just be my girlfriend
It's just you not any other
Ain't no better lover
Come on baby be my girlfriend

I see you walking there
You play your game so smooth
When you came through the door
My heart fell to the floor
So tell me what to do
So I can get with you
Talk to me my lady friend
Girl your love is heaven sent

Say you'll be my girlfriend
'Cause You know you'll never ever find a better man
Mi amore you're what I want
Just be my girlfriend
It's just you not any other
Ain't no better lover
Come on baby be my girlfriend

Get ready for part 2
Of getting down with you
You've got me on a string
To me you're everything
You turn my world around
You lift me up and down
Girl I need you by my side
Let us two be unified

Say you'll be my girlfriend
'Cause You know you'll never ever find a better man
Mi amore you're what I want
Just be my girlfriend
It's just you not any other
Ain't no better lover
Come on baby be my girlfriend

Ah be my girl, my girl girlfriend
Uh ah, be my girl, my girl girlfriend

Yeah mi amore
I see you walking there
You play your game so smooth
I just want you to be my girl
Do you hear me

Say you'll be my girlfriend
'Cause You know you'll never ever find a better man
Mi amore you're what I want
Just be my girlfriend
It's just you not any other
Ain't no better lover
Come on baby be my girlfriend

Say you'll be my girlfriend (oh say you'll be my girlfriend)
'Cause You know you'll never ever find a better man
Mi amore you're what I want
Just be my girlfriend
It's just you not any other
Ain't no better lover
Come on baby be my girlfriend

Ah be my girl, my girl girlfriend
Uh ah, be my girl, my girl girlfriend
