Song:

I'll be loving you, eternally
With a love that's true, eternally
From the start within my heart
It seems I've always known
The sun would shine
When you are mine
And mine alone.

I'll be loving you eternally
There'll be no one new, my dear for me
Though the skies should fall
Remember I shall always be
Forever true and loving you, 
Eternally...
