Song:

Now the records done it's time for fun
We're moving up the charts
I got good reviews and brand new shoes
Beep Beep on my car, Beep Beep on my car
We're moving on my car, we're moving up the charts
I got new shoes and brand new car now

Ok I got friends in the parts of the world
Yup they know my name you-f-f-I-e is heard
Two million plays way before my album's coming out
So when you hear this track best believe I hit the 5
Givin' props to all my crew my top ten is made of stars
We rockin' the planet with feadz in the cosmic car
So let this youngester taken you on a hip-hop ride
Across the planet techno we gonna make your body slide
Charge it, rip it, play it, say it Uffie's got that robot rock oh yeah
Play me on every track it sounds dope while you're just not
We taken super drow everytime we give the show
We go super fast, so this stuff done extra slow
Time and time you starin at my pic like a peepin tom
I gotta thank tom for myspace where it started from
So if you're my friend put your hands up in the air
I'm number 1 on the french hip-hop charts in this... ?

Now the records done it's time for fun
We're moving up the charts
I got good reviews and brand new shoes
Beep Beep on my car, Beep Beep on my car
We're moving on my car, we're moving up the charts
I got new shoes and brand new car now

Nervous break down, panic attack
All this global hoppin has got me out of wack
I gotta stand up tall back up at the wall
To show them at we do at the Ed Bang ball
Hey I'm gone crash your party stay until the dawn
I'm gonna drink all your bottles before I go home
Uffie is that cutie who leaves your bar empty
I'm only 19 and I'm stuper s***
Magazines stalk me like record companies
I'll do this photoshoot but I keep the Gucci
I like to dress fancy, I'm a wise chick
And I got more stamps in my passport then a post it oh
I'm makin the hype yo you know what it's like
Me and feadz travelin first class and we save your whole night ah ha
I got chips yes sir like a computer,
The internet is going nuts and I'm the witch doctor

It's time for fun
It's time it's time for fun
We're we're records done
It's time for fun
We're movin up the charts
I got... Brand new car

Now the records done it's time for fun
We're moving up the charts
I got good reviews and brand new shoes
Beep Beep on my car, Beep Beep on my car
We're moving on my car, we're moving up the charts
I got new shoes and brand new car now
