Song:

I've lead a lifetime fightin' this land
Workin' for nothin with these dry, callused hands
I'm a slave to the sun, It ain't cuttin' me no slack
Gets me beggin' whenever I look back

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been

Three generations countin' on me
To work this farm keep it in the family
Well, I've done all I can and it's past becomin' clear
That I can't hold out much longer here

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been

Ain't no glory in this livin'
Ain't no runnin' from your sins
I hope there's angels where I'm goin'
Ain't no angels where I've been
Ain't no angels where I've been
