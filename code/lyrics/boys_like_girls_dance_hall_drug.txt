Song:

Grown up
She just turned 16
Stuck in the moment
Dead at the scene
And it's on tonight
This is the life that you wanted, right?
So turn off all the lights

Dressed up just like a movie star
At all the parties they'll know who you are
Wouldn't it be great,
To be fashionably late?
So why don't you wait,
Till you're sedated

Don't it feel like something's not right
In his kiss tonight?

Yeah what I'm saying is do you,
Do you want to lose it all?
Cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
You can't wait to fall in love

All I'm saying is do you,
Do you want to learn to fly?
Then you should pack it up and say goodbye
Cause when the push comes to the shove
It's just a dance hall drug

Step in and you can lock the door
The candles are lit and the clothes on the floor
You could take a chance on finding romance
Now you're holding hands

But he's got other plans
Tick-tock, the clock is turning red
The room won't stop spinning and thoughts in your head
And it's too late
You feel like you're making a big mistake
You should've waited

Don't it feel like something's not right
In his kiss tonight?

Yeah what I'm saying is do you, do you want to lose it all?
Cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
You can't wait to fall in love

All I'm saying is do you, do you want to learn to fly?
Then you should pack it up and say goodbye
Cause when the push comes to the shove
It's just a dance hall drug

Just wait love
Show 'em what you're made of
Don't it feel like something's not right,
In his kiss tonight?

Do you, do you want to lose it all?
Cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
You can't wait to fall in love

All I'm saying is do you, do you want to learn to fly?
Then you should pack it up and say goodbye
Cause when the push comes to the shove
It's just a dance hall drug

Do you, do you want to lose it all?
Cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
You can't wait to fall in love

All I'm saying is do you, do you want to learn to fly?
Then you should pack it up and say goodbye
Cause when the push comes to the shove
It's just a dance hall drug
