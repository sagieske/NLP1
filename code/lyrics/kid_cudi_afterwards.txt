S***

Gonna have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, move and slide by
Gonna have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, Got some friends around me
Have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, move and slide by
Gonna have us a good time and I ain’t gonna lie
Got some friends around me, Got some friends around me

Got that bounce, we got it.
Wicked.

[Chorus: X2]
We should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends, we should go to my home
Afterwards, come on

Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends

(X2)
See my paper be on, cross the globe,
Don’t box me in, claustrophobe
Tonight when you’re live we should give em a show
And my living room dance floor is ready to go

Ready to go, ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go

Bring yo friends
Ready to go, ready to go
Bring yo friends
Ready to go, ready to go

[Chorus: X2]
We should go to my home
Afterwards, come on
Bring yo friends, we should go to my home
Afterwards, come on

Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
Bring yo friends
