Song:

Once I was young and so unsure
I'd try any I'll to find the cure
An old man told me
Tryin' to scold me
'oh, son, don't wade to deep in bitter creek, '
(bitter creek)
Out where the desert meets the sky
Is where I go when I wanna hide

Oh, peyote (oh, peyote, mm)
She tried to show me
(tried to show me)
You know there ain't no cause to weep
At bitter creek
(bitter creek)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

We're gonna hit the road for one last time
We can walk right in and steal 'em blind
All that money (all that money, ooh..)
No more runnin' (no more runnin')
I can't wait to see the old man's face
When I win the race
(bitter creek)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo,
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo..........
