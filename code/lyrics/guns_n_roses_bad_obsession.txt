Song:

I can't stop thinkin', thinking 'bout sinkin'
Sinkin' down into my bed
I call my mother, she's just a c*** now
She said I'm sick in the head
She said you ain't special so who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout seein' ya one more time, oh no
But I already left you and you're better off left behind

It's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

Too bad you're f****d up

I used to be wasted, always tried to take it
Take it down into my vein
I call the doctor, he's just another
He said I'm sick in the brain
He said you ain't special so who you foolin'
Don't try ta give me a line
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout doin' it one more time, oh no
But I already left you and you're better off left behind, oh yeah

Aw it's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
It's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind

So bad
Boy

It's a, it's a, heads up
It's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
Now it's a bad obsession, it's always messin'
It's always messin' my mind
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout doin' it one more time, oh no
See I already left you and you're better off left behind, oh no, oh no
It's a bad obsession and you're always messin' my mind
See I already left you and you're better off left behind
Uh huh, no

Maybe you'll do better next time, punk
