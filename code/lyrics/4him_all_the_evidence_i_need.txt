Song:

Well I've seen the news
And I've heard the questions
Seems the thing to do
Is to keep second guessing
The one who made the earth and sky
I guess it's okay just to wonder why
But I know the truth, and I know I'm certain
It's not a mystery, It's not behind a curtain
The veil was torn many year ago
And the Spirit stayed just to let us know
That the answer is not in the stars way up high
But the answer is found in believing in Christ
chorus
So I am walking by faith and not by sight
And I am trusting in invisible things
For I have felt in my heart
What I can't see with my eyes
'Cause the proof is living inside of me
I've been set free
And this is all the evidence I need
There are pyramids
In the land of Egypt
There are those who say
That they contain the secrets
To where we're from and why we're here
But I think God's Word makes it crystal clear
That the ancient tombs in the barren desert
Do not hold the clues
They do not hold the answers
The truth has already been revealed
For it's moving in me and I know that it's real
'Cause it's not in the grave for the skeptics to see
But he lives in the hearts of the ones who believe
repeat chorus
bridge
'Cause I know Your love reaches out to me
In my weakest of days
For I've felt Your touch In my hearts of hearts
Though I've never even seen Your face
repeat chorus
