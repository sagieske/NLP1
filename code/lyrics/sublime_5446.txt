Song:

Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
And give it to a police man
I wouldn't do that I wouldn't do that

If I did that would you say
Sir come down and put the charge on me
I wouldn't do that oohhh I wouldn't do that

I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
They were wrong they were wrong

Give it to me one time (ohh give it to me, yeah!)
Give it to me - two times
Give it to me three times
Give it to me four times

Oh 5446 was my number was my number now
Right now somebody else has that number
(one more time)
5447 was my number was my number now
Right now somebody else has that number

''cause we're chillin' and we're chillin' into the club all night
We're chillin' and we're chillin' into the club all night
Hear the dub hear the beat in the dog pound dj
Lord have his grilled cheese

Some jealous punk snuck up around my back
Tried to take the lovin' over me
Lord I got into a fist fight
And wound up in jail all night

Give it to me one time (ohh yes, ooh my pussy)
Give it to me - two times
Give it to me three time
Give it to me four time

People listen up don't stand too near
I've got somethin' that you all should hear
All lies all the lies told to me
Form a little part of history

I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek and life's okay

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view, oh
It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own
A ba na na na na whooo

People listen up don't stand too close
I've got somethin' that you all should know
Holy matrimony is not for me
I'd rather die alone in misery

Because I was always taught boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say

With a girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
And a ball and chain I call my home
A-ba-na-na-na-na, whooo

Crazy world to live alone

With a girl that you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain, ohh

I step into the great unknown
And a ball and chain I call my own

Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surley find another way

Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love get married and forget the world
Nine months later the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek and life's okay

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view whoa

I step into the great unknown
With a ball and chain I call my own
A-ba-na-na-na-na whoooo
