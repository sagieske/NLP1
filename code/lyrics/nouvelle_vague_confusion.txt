Song:

Confusion
Confusion

You're hiding from feelings
Searching for more
Sharing and hoping
Untouched for so long

Our lives still change
From the way that we were
And now I'll tell you something
I think you should know

You just can't believe me
When I show you what you mean to me
You just can't believe me
When I show you what you cannot see

You cause me confusion
You told me you cared
He's calling these change
That last to the end

Ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies
That past is your present
The future is mine

You just can't believe me
When I show you what you mean to me
You just can't believe me
When I show you what you cannot see

Confusion
Confusion

Tell me you need me
I'll make it this time
This thread won't divide us
Sensation survives

I was sure that I told you
It was good from the face
You've caused me some problems
You've taken my place

Confusion
Confusion
Confusion

You just can't believe me
When I show you what you mean to me
You just can't believe me
When I show you what you cannot see
