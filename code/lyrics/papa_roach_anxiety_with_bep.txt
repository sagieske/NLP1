[Will. I. Am (Fergie, Apl. De. Ap & Taboo)]
I feel like I wanna smack somebody
Turn around and b***h slap somebody (bitch)
But I ain't goin out bro (no, no, no)
I ain't givin into it (no, no, no)
Anxieties bash my mind in
Terrorizin my soul like Bin Laden
But I ain't fallin down bro (no, no, no)
I won't lose control bro (no, no, no)
Shackle and chained
My soul feels stained
I can't explain got an itch on my brain
Lately my whole aim is to maintain
And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin out propaine
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
I'm in a fast car drivin in the fast lane
In the rain and I'm might just hydroplaine

[Apl. De. Ap]
I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealin with somethin that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's

[Papa Roach]
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoia's brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety

[Apl. De. Ap (Fergie, Will. I. Am & Taboo]
My head keeps runnin away my brother
The only thing makin me stay my brother
But I won't give into it bro (no, no, no)
Gotta get myself back now
God, I can't let my mind be
Tell my enemy is my own
Gots to find my inner wealth
Gots to hold up my thoughts
I can't get caught (no, no, no)
I can't give into it now (no, no, no)
Emotions are trapped set on lock
Got my brain stuck goin through the motions
Only I know what's up
I'm filled up with pain
Tryna gain my sanity
Everywhere I turn its a dead end infront of me
With nowhere to go gotta shake this anxiety
Got me feelin strange paranoia took over me
And its weighin me down
And I can't run any longer, yo
Knees to the ground

I don't fear none of my enemies
And I don't fear bullets from oozies
I've been dealin with somethin that's worse than these
That'll make you fall to your knees and that's

[Papa Roach]
The anxiety the sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
The sane and the insane rivalry
Paranoias brought me to my knees
Lord please please please
Take away my anxiety
