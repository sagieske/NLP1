Song:

We just discovered each other
Tonight when the lights were low
One dance led up to another
And now I can't let you go

So tell me I may always dance
The Anniversary Waltz with you
Tell me this is real romance
An anniversary dream come true

Let this be the answer
To our future years
Through millions of smiles
And a few little tears

May I always listen to
The Anniversary Waltz
With you Let this be the answer

To our future years
Through millions of smiles
And a few little tears
May I always listen to
The Anniversary Waltz
With you
