Song:

(Harlan Howard)
Go West Young Man the signs all seem to say
There's San Diego, Frisco or la
Leave that cold, cold woman far behind
Warm yourself in that California sunshine.
Go west young man become a movie star
Or anything except the fool you are
Expose the lonely corners of your mind
To a little fad of that California sunshine.
I need a change I've headed up to here
She's just playing game that's very clear
But her play mate will soon be hard to find
'Cause I'll be in that California sunshine.
--- Instrumental ---
They say those California girls are fine
They know how to really walk your mind
Well, one of you get ready 'cause you're mine
I'm headin' for that California sunshine.
I need a change I've headed up to here
She's just playing game that's very clear
But her play mate will soon be hard to find
'Cause I'll be in that California sunshine.
Baby, I'll be in that California sunshine...
