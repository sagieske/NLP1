Song:

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well, you laughed, baby it's okay
It's buzzcut season anyway
(Well, you laughed, baby it's okay)

Explosions on tv
And all the girls with
Heads inside a dream
So now we'll
Live beside the pool
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with our knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with our knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hard, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men upon the news
They try to tell us all
That we will lose
But it's so
Easy in this blue
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
And nothings wrong but nothings true
I live in a hologram with you

Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, let it go)
Play along
And make believe it's never real
But I live in a hologram with you

Cold with a burnt out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
And that will never be enough for us

Explosions on tv
And all the girls with
Heads inside a dream
So now we'll
Live beside the pool
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
And nothing's wrong but nothing's true
I live in a hologram with you

Where all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, let it go)
Play along
And make believe it's never real
But I live in a hologram with you
