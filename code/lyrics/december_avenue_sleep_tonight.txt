Song:

Tell your goodnight to the light and close your eyes
There's a better place for you than to stay awake
You'll get closer to a paradise of dreamers in love
You'll get better like heaven has done something

So lay now
Hear me all through the night/I'll take over the night
There's no teardrop, You can count on me tonight
Or I'll stay up with you

Baby it's alright
I'll be right by your side
No need to cry out loud
Nothing to cry about
Baby it's alright
I'll be just by your side
I'll keep you on my sight
I'll never leave 'til you sleep tonight

Cover you with my arms and hold you tight
I'll be listening to your wonderful and calm little voice
I'll keep watching 'til my eyes burn down

I'll never sleep, I'll never leave, I'm gonna chase this dream tonight
