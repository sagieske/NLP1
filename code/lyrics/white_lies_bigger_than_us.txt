Song:

You took the tunnel route home
You've never taken that way with me before
Did you feel the need for change?
Apologies on your fingernails
Love flickered in the city of lights,
Like intermittent radio waves

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I want you to hold me, I want you to pray
This is bigger than us

You went where the horses cry
You've never taken that way with me before
Did you feel the need for change?
Guilt smeared across your lips
I was tired and cold from the window
You're tired, nothing has changed

I don't need your tears
I don't want your love
I just gotta get home

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us

And I feel like I'm breaking up, and I wanted to stay
Headlights on the hillside, don't take me this way
I don't want you to hold me, I don't want you to pray
This is bigger than us
