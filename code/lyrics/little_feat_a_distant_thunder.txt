Song:

B. Payne, S. Murphy, P. Barrere
give my best to thosei I care for
with firends a simple nod will do
I bow to those who've come and gone before me
a handshake to the past
it gets me through
been a little bit good and a little bit sad
let the dirt and dust fall where it may
a distant thunder and it takes my breath away
tumblin' in a whirlwind pullin' clouds from the sky
pressure is a pyramid in a scream that no one hears
a thousand lifetimes couldn't cover my tears
oh cover my tears
measured distance through the heartbeats
measured time holds all my beliefs
these shotgun visions are all I've ever lived with
a scattered mind from a reckless youth
I cover my ears, I cover my eyes
still all the fears, still heard the lies
a distant thunder and it takes my breath away
tumblin' in a whirlwind pullin' clouds from the sky
pressure is a pyramid in a scream that no one hears
a thousand lifetimes couldn't cover my tears
oh cover my tears
took convention for a rough ride
a genius under glass set adrift
direction all but fading
like a kiss that leaves you floating in a trance
the rivers I cross the memories I keep
A minute to smile, forever to weep
a distant thunder and it takes my breath away
tumblin' in a whirlwind pullin' clouds from the sky
pressure is a pyramid in a scream that no one hears
a thousand lifetimes couldn't cover my tears
oh cover my tears
a distand thunder, I feel like I'm slippin' under
tumblin' in a whirlwind pullin' clouds from the sky
of all those times that I've turned and looked away
a thousand lifetimes couldn't cover my tears
oh cover my tears
