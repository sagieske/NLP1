Song:

I'm staring at the clock
I'm wondering why I'm still here
(Yeah)
And my head's about to pop
Thinking that you best stay clear
(Yeah)

How did I get stuck
In this predicament I don't know
I wanna throw this repetition
Out the window
I'm getting tired
Of wondering why I'm still here

And I wish that I could
(Snap my fingers)
Make myself disappear
(Snap my fingers)
Get myself outta here
(Snap my fingers)
(Snap my fingers)
Oh oh

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I could be catching a wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top down
Kissing my girl

I could be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

The sun is coming up
I wanna get out of there
Well, here we go again
I'm back to where I began

You can take my checkbook
Credit cards and keep 'em
I'd give them up just 
For a little bit of freedom
And my escape
I'm planning it in my head

And I wish that I could
(Snap my fingers)
Make myself disappear
(Snap my fingers)
Get myself outta here
(Snap my fingers)
(Snap my fingers)
Oh oh

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I could be sipping a drink
I could be getting a tan
I could be hanging on a beach
With my toes in the sand

I could be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

No more bus stops
Sitting in traffic
Waking up at 6 in the morning
It ain't gonna happen

No more office
No more line-ups
You can just forget about it

We want freedom

We want, we want, we want
We want freedom

We want, we want, we want

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I could be catching the wave
I could be seeing the world
I could be riding with the top-down
Kissing my girl

I could be sleeping in
I could be living it up
I could be sitting at home
Not giving a fuck

I could be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here

I'd rather be anywhere else
Anywhere else
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
Anywhere else but here
