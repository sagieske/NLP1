[Verse:]
Wake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do my hair, gotta put on make up
Gotta act like I care bout this fake stuff
Straight up
What a waste of my day
If I had it my way, I'd roll out of bed say
Bout 2: 30 mid day, hit the blunt then hit you up
To come over to my place, you show up right away
We make love and then we f**k and then you give me my space

[Hook:]
What I am trying to say is
The love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

[Verse 2:]
Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vapor up
Let's get faded
Gotta call your job tell em you wont make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted, we should just get naked.
Cause I've been working hard and I know you be on that same s**t
Every other days a different game that you just can't win
I just wanna ease your mind and make you feel alright
So go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight, right

[Hook:]
What I'm trying to say is the love is
Ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

[Verse 3/Childish Gambino]
It's not love but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it, means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Married to the drugs, but the feels keep coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running (ew)
Wipe it on my shirt, haha I need sleep
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love when you say "guess what?" (What, what)
Giving me stories of another n***a kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up, up, up, up)
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act never mind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby, so dumb hot
I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once sold two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (just us, just us)

[Verse 4]
Okay, got this oj and Jose
Mixed it with that Rosa
We gon do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And it's peace and love like the old days

[Hook:]
What I'm trying to say is the love is
Ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it

[Outro:]
We should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
We should lay right here
Cause everything is okay right here
