Song:

Back on the breadline by Hunters & Collectors
Stand in line
With your empty cup you're still waiting
For the future of all your living souls
Wait for the incoming calls
Your desperation
Where does it lead to false riches?
And the little girl's greed your still young
Oh, but you've tasted it all
Is that you
You used to be so proud
Is that you
Looking so hungry
Is that you
Standing at the back of the breadline
Back of the breadline
Back of the breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline
You used to be
So careles and sure of your possessions
A moment before you got too restless
Got up and walked out the door
Don't look to me
Look to the west the sun is setting
You've been second-guessed, what bears the future?
Bottom line is what you must believe in.
Is that you
You used to be so proud
Is that you
Looking so hungry
Is that you
Standing in the back of the breadline
Back of the breadline
Back of tye breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline
Is that you
You used to be so proud
Is that you
Looking so hungry
Is that you
Don't look to me is thatyou
You used to be free is that you
Standing at the back of the breadline
Stand in line
With your empty cup you're still waiting
For the future of all your living souls
Oh, but you've tasted it all
Back of the breadline
Back of tye breadline
Meet you where the daydreamers stand
Standing at the back of the breadline
