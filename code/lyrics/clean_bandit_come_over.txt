Song:

Never said any of this was gonna be simple
Sometimes all it takes is just a simple oh-oh-oh
Because the place
You want to reach is right in front of you
You're getting stronger
So just keep on that bit longer
Rap-pa-pum

Girl come over
Me want you closer
I'm tired of the rainy days

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine

So before the nights over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over

I guess you're gonna run out luck love,
Sooner or later
You better make time to sit down
And put pen to paper oh-oh-oh
Because the things you want to do will slip away from you
It won't be long now
So just keep on being strong now
Rap pa pum

Girl come over
Me want you closer
I'm tired of the rainy days

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine

So before the nights over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

On regular she blow my mind
Your turn, my darling
I can't live without you
Without you (No, no, no)
Girl you got me weak at my knees
7 days of the week
I can't stop think about you
About you

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine
Sun, sun, sun
Sun-shine

Look at my style
Me hear them saying 'l'm sorry girl'
And both times no one feels to stay the night over
Nineteen days pass since I last see the girl
Be at the bedroom over
Got no fight over

Regular she cuss me
Tell her friends, then mos, how she no trusts me
Well if I saw you down from here, let me pay
Since the last three months
You know you want me

Me won't pick up me phone
No dial-dial-oo
Don't put pressure on me, I'll ask you
Here baby let me love you
You know I wan't some
No me wish you know
About my, my manual

Won't pick up the phone
No dial-dial-oo
Don't put pressure on me, I'll ask you
Here baby let me love you
You know I wan't some
No me wish you know
About my, my manual
Ra-pa-pum

Girl come over
Me want you closer
I'm tired of the rainy days

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

So before the nights over
I want you to know that
I'm willing to change my ways

You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine

Come over, Come over
Come over, C-Come over
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
You bring me
Sun, sun, sun, sun-shine
