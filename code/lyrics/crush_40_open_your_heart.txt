Song:

Thunder, rain, and lightning
Danger, water rising
Clamour, sirens wailing
It's such a bad sign

Shadows of dark creatures
Steel clouds floating in the air
People run for shelter
What's gonna happen to us!?

All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake
I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do
You and I are same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change
Yours is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose

Can't hold on much longer - but I will never let go
I know it's a one way track - tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way - nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn - now I see what I've gotta do

Open your heart, it's gonna be allright

Ancient city blazing
Shadows keep attacking
Little children crying
Confusion, hopeless anger

I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy
All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way

Can't hold on much longer - but I will never let go
I know it's a one way track - tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way - nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn - now I see what I've gotta do

Open your heart... And you'll see...

If it won't stop, there will be no future for us
Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free

I know it's a one way track - tell me now how long this'll last
Close my eyes and feel it burn - now I see what I've gotta do

Gotta open your heart, dude!

Can't hold on much longer - but I will never let go
I know it's a one way track - tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way - nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn - now I see what I've gotta do

Open your heart, it's gonna be allright
