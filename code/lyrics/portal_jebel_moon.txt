Song:

So life's a game? When can we play with yours?
With just a flick of the needle, we're sure to best our scores
And as the fates avail our skins
A mark for the ages, let the games begin. Yeah, we're so "in"

So you think you're the s**t. Well, there's something in the air
It's just a drop in the water, but you sense it's presence there
And from the deep of the rising seas
A mystic abrasion will soon be surfacing

Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it! Raise your voice
Fifteen - fading or ripped away
We've all got something to say

Is there a voice that whispers on the wind
A subtle symptom of conscience, of cold indifference thinned
It's the world that lights my tongue
For self-indulged preservations, not what we've become

Can you feel it? Make some noise
Let me hear it! Where's your voice
Fifteen - fading or ripped away
We've all got something to say!

Can you feel it? (x4)

Can you feel it? Make some noise
Do you fear it? Raise your voice
Fifteen fading, while they're ripped away
We've all got something to say.
