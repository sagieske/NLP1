Song:

I lost my shirt a few days back
And I can feel the rain
Pouring down upon my heart
And I just want to love myself
Into you
Until I just let go

Surround me
Completely
Lost somewhere in your arms
I need you
I can't wait too long
You love
So well
And as far as I can tell
You save me
I can't wait too long

For everything that I have seen
In each defining moment
Where I gave in to this dream
And I try
Accept myself
Come what may
I need to feel my life

Surround me
Completely
Lost somewhere in your arms
I need you
I can't wait too long
You love
So well
And as far as I can tell
You save me
I can't wait too long
I can't wait too long

As I fall slowly through the night
Restless motion
Every hour of my life

Surround me
Completely
Lost somewhere in your arms
I need you
I can't wait too long
You love
So well
And as far as I can tell
You save me
I can't wait too long


I can't wait
I can't wait too long
I can't wait
I can't wait too long
