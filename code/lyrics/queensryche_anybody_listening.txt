Song:

You and I
Long to live like wind upon the water
If we close our eyes
We'll maybe realize
There's more to life than what we have known

And I can't believe I've spent so long
Living lies I knew were wrong inside
I've just begun to see the light

Long ago, there was a dream
Had to make a choice or two
Leaving all I loved behind
For what nobody knew

Stepped out on the stage
A life under lights and judging eyes
Now the applause has died and I can dream again...

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?

Read between the lines
Criticize the words they're selling
Think for yourself and feel the walls
Become sand beneath your feet

Feel the breeze?
Time's so near
You can almost taste the freedom

There's a
Warm wind from the south
Hoist the sail
And we'll be gone
By morning, this will all seem like a dream

And if I don't return
To sing the song, maybe just as well
I've seen the news
And there's not much I can do... Alone

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?

What's behind the words
Images they know will please us?
I'll take what's real
Bring up the lights

Is there anybody listening?
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?

Read between the lines
Criticize the words they're selling
Think for yourself and feel the walls
Become sand
Beneath your feet
