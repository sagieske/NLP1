Song:

In your eyes I see the pain,
Of a child who runs away,
And he's thinking that tomorrow,
Will be ok like in a fairytale.

I close my eyes, and see your dreams,
Of a perfect, loving man,
But some things don't come so easily,
You know I'll try if you give me a chance.

'Cause I do love you.
Yes I do love you.
And dreams do come true.
Baby I love you so.

In your eyes, I see as true,
... 's more that's, harmony.
And don't worry about tomorrow.
I'll be your friend, you can lean on me.

'Cause I do love you.

Yes I do love you.
And dreams do come true.
Baby I love you so.

Just you 'n me.

You know, I love you.

For all those times that I've been wrong.
I ask you baby please,
Understand.
You know it takes some rain,
For a tree,
To grow strong.

'Cause I do love you.
Yes, I do love you.
And dreams do come true.
Baby I love you so.

Just you 'n me.

'Cause I do love you.
Yes I do love you.
And dreams do come true.
Baby I love you so.

You know I love you.
