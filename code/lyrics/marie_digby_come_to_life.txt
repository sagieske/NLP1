Song:

There's a river flowing through me... It knows me
It's currents, they control my emotions
But there's just one stream that evades me, escapes me
It overflows when my heart's left open

Your feelings, are the one thing
Out of my control, it's not in my hands
Not knowing... Is killing me
Where's the way inside your soul?
We gotta get it grow

Like a flower under rain
Like a child's first day
Like a story's first page
Watch our love come to life
Love is not a thing to rush
It's a feeling you should trust
It'll be that way with us
Watch our love come to life
Come to life come to life
Watch our love come to life

There's not point in our predictions
Or wishing... The paths we're on are somehow connected
Cause you can't see around the corner
You wanna... Cause you're so afraid life'll leave you rejected
When you least expect it

Your feelings... Are the one thing
Out of my control... It's not in my hands
Not knowing, is killing me
Where's the way inside your soul... We gotta let it grow

Like a flower under rain
Like a child's first day
Like a story's first page
Watch our love come to life
Love is not a thing to rush
It's a feeling you should trust
It'll be that way with us
Watch our love come to life
Come to life come to life
Watch our love come to life
