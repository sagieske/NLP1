Song:

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears

I don't claim to be perfect
I know I'm damaged goods
But I wanna be led out of darkness just like every lady would
Lick my wounds and watch them seal with your healing heart
Embrace my sadness, Look after me
Coz there is no one else I 'd ask

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears
Piece me all together, though broken I am sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood but I can hear it beat

I am scared of shadows in the night
When you are not there by my side
Sick of nightmares in my sleep
When there is no place I can hide
See the beauty in the blood that drips down from my eyes
Hold the parts that were ripped out
That took me by surprise

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears
Piece me all together though broken I am sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood but I can hear it beat

Boom boom Here it goes boom boom
To the sound of the grand piano
I am dancing in your light
In the light in here

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears
Piece me all together though broken I am sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood but I can hear it beat

I'm a broken doll and you're the puppeteer
Take control for me and wipe away my fears
Piece me all together the broken eye and sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood but I can hear it beat
