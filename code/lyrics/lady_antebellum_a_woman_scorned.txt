Song:

Candy caught Bo in bed with the red head
She threw a fit and a fern and the "F" word at the both of them
She peppered him with bbs cause she couldn't find the 12-gauge
Said Cindy Lou I know you're husband and there's gonna be hell to pay

There ain't nothing like a woman scorned
There ain't nothing more dangerous than a country girl trading her halo for horns
The neighboors knew they were in for a war
They saw a screaming half-naked waffle house waitress flying off the porch
No one slams the door like a woman scorned

Candy came back Bo was zipping up his Levis
She chased him around the kitchen he was trying to apoligize
He dialed a 9 and 1 'fore she landed that left hook
She knocked him out cold Candy's stronger than she looks

There ain't nothing like a woman scorned
There ain't nothing more dangerous than a country girl trading her halo for horns
The neighboors knew who was winning that war
They saw a half-naked bleeding husband who'd been cheating spread eagle on the porch
No one slams the door like a woman scorned

There ain't nothing like a woman scorned
There ain't nothing more dangerous than a country girl trading her halo for horns
And oh she swears all is fair in love and war
Said if you wanna be a dog
I'll treat you like a dog
You're sleeping on the porch
No one slams the door like a woman scorned
Like a woman scorned
