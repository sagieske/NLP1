Song:

Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darling and stay
Always late with your kisses
Why-why-why do you want to do me this way (do me this way)
How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late (always late)
Always late with your kisses
Why-why-why do you want to do me this way
