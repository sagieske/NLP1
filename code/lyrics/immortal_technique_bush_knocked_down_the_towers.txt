(mos def)
Man you hear this bullshit they be talkin
Everyday man
Its like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
You know what im sayin?
So wow

Listen!

(hook - mos def) 2X

Bin laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you nigga, tell the truth nigga
(bush knocked down the towers)
Tell the truth nigga
(bush knocked down the towers)
Tell the truth nigga


I pledge no allegiance
Nigga fuck the presidents speeches
Im baptized by america
And covered in leeches
The dirty water that preaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The patriot act attract you to the type that you love
They try to frame you
And say you was trying to sell drugs
They throw a federal indictment on niggas
To show you love
This shit is run by fake christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions and look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen but they don't really tell you their mission
They funded Al Qaeda, and now they blame the muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactition
They gave him billions of dollars and funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11 that's just scratching the surface.

(hook)



They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit I'll show you why it's totally wrong
'cause if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through harlem and washington heights
I wouldn't be fighting for bush or white americas dream
Id be fighting for my people, survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches in the south my nigga
Id be fighting to keep the occupation out my nigga
You ever clocked someone who talk shit or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you and was rapin your moms
And of course saddam hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit after ronald regans election
Mercinary contractors fight in a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlin the ghetto with a fear of attack
Trying to distract the fact that they engineering the crack
So im strapped like (lee malvo?) holdin a sniper rifle
These bullets 'll touch your kids and i don't mean like michael
Your body 'll be sent to the morgue, stripped down and recycled
I fire on (house?) niggas that support you and like you
'cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This aint no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written underneath the dollar on the masonic seal

(eminem)
I don't rap for dead presidents
Id rather see the president dead
Its never been said but i said presidence.
