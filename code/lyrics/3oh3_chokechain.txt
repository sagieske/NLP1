Song:

I got this s**t on lock
I got this s**t on lock
Holla' Holla' at me if you on my block
I got this s**t on lock
I got this s**t on lock
Holla' Holla' at me if you on my block

I got yo' dogs on a collar, balla
So how you like that?
Chokechain for their necks, and I don't think they like that
Woof woof - How they howl
Give some chow, they bout to growl
Little dogs will kill you dude, as soon as you let 'em out

Purebread (Purebread)
Got 'em with the nice coat
Your head (Your head)
When I...
Dig deep(dig deep)
Shock collars on their necks
You f**k with 3OH! 3, and motherf**kas know they next

Now get yo' drum on (c'mon and getcha drum on)
Getcha getcha drum on (c'mon and getcha drum on)

I got a chokechain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rotweiler
Got a - chockchain for my pitbull lane
I got a shock collar for my rotweiler
Got a - Chokechain (ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (sh-sh-shock collar)
I got a choke chain (ch-ch-chokechain)
I got a shock collar (sh-sh-shock collar)

I got my woof from a white teen - He won't bite me
F**kin with me, and you'll get bitten most likely
Howlin' at the moon - growling at the lightning
Ugh, I said this sh** is mad Frightening
We got the drum hits, tell your kid to get a better etiquitte
Before he splits his seed to try to?
You gotta sa-say, g-g-go put it away
Yeah we be runnin' the game, now it's all one in the same

Now get yo' drum on (c'mon and getcha drum on)
Getcha getcha drum on (c'mon and getcha drum on)

I got this s**t on lock
I got this s**t on lock
Holla' Holla' at me if you on my block
I got this s**t on lock
I got this s**t on lock
Holla' Holla' at me if you on my block
