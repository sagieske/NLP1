Song:

Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swim so wild and you swim so free
Heaven above and the sea below
And a little white whale on the go

Baby Beluga, baby Beluga, is the water warm?
Is your mama home with you so happy?

Way down yonder where the dolphins play
Where you dive and splash all day
Waves roll in and the waves roll out
See the water squirting out of your spout

Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga, sing your little song
Sing for all your friends, we'll like to hear you

When it's dark you're home and fed
Curl up snug in your water bed
Moon is shining and the stars are out
Good night, little whale, goodnight

Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga, with tomorrow's sun
Another day's begun, you'll soon be waking

Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea
Swim so wild and you swim so free
Heaven above and the sea below
And a little white whale on the go
You're just a little white whale on the go
