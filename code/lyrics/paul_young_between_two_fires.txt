Song:

(Barry Manncynthia Weilljerry Leibermike Stoller)
They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway
They say there's always magic
In the air
But when you7re walkin' down the street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off
And you're nowhere
They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway
But lookin' at them
Just gives me the blues
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even
Shine your shoes?
They say that I won't last too long
On Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home
They all say
But they're dead wrong
I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway
On Broadway
On Broadway
Give me that crack
Give me some of that crack
Give me that crack
Ahhhhh
Broadway
