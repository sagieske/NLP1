Song:

Ya know it's ya boy iyaz and Big Time Rush

If I ruled the world, I'd throw all the money in the air like confetti
If I ruled the world, every house got a dj and a backyard party
I break up the borders down
When I shake the ground
If I ruled the world, I'd dream out loud

[Chorus:]
So everybody get up, up, out of your seats
Kick off your shoes like you're down at the beach
Jump up, up, up on the beat singing ayo, ayo, ayo
Up, up, out of your seats,

Be who you are love is all you need
All of us geeks, freaks, and wannabe's singing ayo
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you

If you were my girl, you'd never have to worry about another thing no
Cause I rule the world, and you'd be right next to me running the show
We'd throw every rule in the book out, and bring down the house,
If you were my girl we'd dream out loud

[Chorus:]

[Iyaz]
I'd be beating on my chest, I'm the king of the hill,
Iyaz and Big Time Rush keeping it real.
Magic carpets girl we go wherever,
I ain't trying to run game, I ain't trying to be clever

Girl I'm'ma be the king and you will be the queen
Going 100 miles an hour, girl we running the streets,
And if the cops ever try and pull us over,
We tell them "Hey Mr. Officer we own ya!"

Hey oh!
If I ruled the wooorld...

[Chorus:]

If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you

If I ruled the world
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you
I would give it, give it all to you
Give it, give it, give it all to you

If I ruled the world
