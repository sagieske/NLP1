Song:

Thought you were my star
Thought you were the moon
But since you've come down here
I sit so confused
What more can I do
Too speechless to say
They told me that love would
Never feel this way
See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns I suppose
But then I lied, we've stayed in rewind
And Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken
Now I'm broken
Now I'm broken

Can't say I was blind
I seen this before
For your full attention
It seems I'm at war
Consistently more
There's no more to prove
This treasure hunts over
I found all the clues
See down in my heart
I gave it a hunet and one percent all the time
Thinking that I
Could live out these eh-ep-si-si- isodes
No reruns suppose
But then I lied this hectic divine
And now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down
Now I'm broken down

You make it hard to hold you down, down
But you still hard to do without, out
How do you live with your mistakes, stakes
But then again
Why do
I stay
Yeah
