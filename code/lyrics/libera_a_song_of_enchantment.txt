Song:

A song of enchantment I sang me there
In a green green wood by waters fair
Just as the words came up to me
I sang it under a wild wood tree

Widdershins turned I singing it low
Watching the wild birds come and go
No cloud in the deep dark to be seen
Under the thick thatch branches green

Twilight came silence came
The planet of evening's silver flame
By darkening paths I wandered through
Thickets trembling with drops of dew

But the music is lost and the words are gone
Of the song I sang as I sat along
Ages and ages have fallen on me
On the wood and the pool and the elder tree
