Song:

She looks in the mirror
And stares at the wrinkles
That weren't there yesterday

And thinks of the young man
That she almost married
What would he think if
He saw her this way

She hangs up her apron
In little girl fashion
As something comes
Into her mind

Slowly starts dancing
Remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys
She had waiting in line

(CHORUS)
Oh, such are the dreams
Of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere
Any time of the day
An everyday housewife who
Gave up the good life for me

The photograph album she
Takes from the closet and
Slowly turns the first page

And carefully picks up
The crumbling flower
The first one he gave her
Now withered with age

She closes her eyes
And touches the house dress
That suddenly disappears

And just for the moment
She's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds
Back so many years

(CHORUS)

An everyday housewife who
Gave up the good life for me
