Song:

I remember
Like lightning to the heart, I saw things clearer
The day you came inside, I felt brand new
So what am I to do now?
Well you don't have to say it
Cuz I can read your mind
You do not have to stay here
If you don't have the time
And if you muust go, just know I gave you my whole world
Trusted & loved you, must've been cuz I'm a crazy girl
Yeah you really took things too far...
And there are some things that you should know
My mama was a gypsy
My daddy was a rollin' stone
I wonder did he miss me... Cuz he was never home
So I thought you would, I thought you could be the one
I never really knew love
So I thought you would, I thought you could be the one
But you already knew love
From a beautiful woman & your beautiful child
Left me in beautiful ruins, instead of pullin' me out
So I think I should, I think I'll just walk away
From the beautiful moments we made
From the beautiful ruins you made here
What a beautiful woman you've made of me
