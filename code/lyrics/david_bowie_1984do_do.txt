Song:

Someday they won't let you, but now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984
They'll break your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell you that you're eighty, but lover you won't care
You'll be shooting up as usual like tomorrow wasn't there
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we rolled
In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for more)
Now we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?
Lies jump in queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
She's doesn't recall her blessed childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure, not a she
When lovers chose each other seems the perks are due
Another memo to screw
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Can you wipe your nose my child
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?
Will you sleep in fear tonight?
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbour Jim
He's come to turn you in
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me (didn't hear it from me)
Come see, come see, remember me?
We played at an all night movie role
You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled
In 1984, who could ask for more
1984, who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore
Mor-or-or-or-ore
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
1984 (who could ask for more)
1984
Ooooo
