Song:

Take your time, it's alright
You blow my mind, with your brown eyes
While I'm on my grind, I can't help but notice you, you, you
I can see, where you need to be, where you need to be
That's when me, you should go with me, you can go with me

Come on, I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your, touch your x 4

The... Rose if you got to
You're so damn cool, that's why I f**k with you
You're so damn cute, that's why I'm with you, you, you
I can see, where you need to be, where you need to be
That's when me, you should go with me, you can go with me

I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your, touch your

The way you rub your body, got me so excited
No other place to be
Girl you know I can't fight it
Let me get behind it
Drop it like it's hot for me

I can see, where you need to be, where you need to be
And that's when we, you should go with me, you can go with me

I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
I just wanna touch your body
