Song:

I thought I didn't need you
Thought I could rule the world without you by my side
As the world bears down on my shoulders
I find the fear doesn't subside

Where have you been?
I've been so alone
I don't know how I've lasted this long

You said "The fires won't consume you,
And in the rivers you won't drown"
I wish to pause this moment
'Cause as I cry I start to realize
What's missing was you

I need you
You give me strength
You take away my fear
There was a void in my heart that only you could fill
