Song:

[Verse:]
Through the fire, smoke, and broken rubble
Walks the secret life, bullet-proof and bulging muscle
Death-defying, highest flying over trouble
Can you please come and help us out our hopeless struggles
Sympathy is wearing off and dying out
In the face of all these enemies and crying out
Losing all this energy from finding out
The world is filled with ills, ever so close to timing out

[Hook:]
Where, are those heroes
Where, are those super-heroes

[Verse 2:]
Pondering, that super-villain's got a point
Told the captain on the roof while they was smoking joints
Flicked the ashes down into the street below
Looked up, said he hate the city now, even though
He swore that he'd protect it when he landed
Their perspective's now changed, all pretty much abandoned
The captain spray cologne around and said he understand it
It's getting hard to separate the saints from the satanic

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Last remarks, they did it to themselves
I killed off heaven, now I live in hell
So complicit and they all non-survival
Told them that they biggest rival is inside you
I do possess the power to revive you
But if I did that, I'd just have to fight you
Cause you truly are the hero and the villain
The world stood froze, hearing a truth so chilling
Reporters start filming, somebody shouted, "Kill him!"
He looked back in disgust and flew up to the ceiling
Busted through the roof and kicked over the building
Before it hit the ground, a younger hero flew around
And put it on his shoulders, said you're naive now
But believe, you'll believe me when you're older
Every asteroid you stop and bomb you fly up into space
You ain't saving them from danger, you're keeping danger safe

[Hook:]
