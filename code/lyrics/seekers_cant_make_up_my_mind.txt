Song:

Chorus:
Can't make up my mind where you might hide away from me;
Everywhere I've seached, and still I can't make up my mind.
Maybe I'll stay here, maybe I'll go;
I don't know what to do.
It isn't easy seaching around;
I can't believe it's true.
Oh, no, now.
When I awoke I opened my eyes,
And when I turned around,
I found your note pushed under my door;
You'd gone without a sound.
[Chorus:]
Can't make up my mind.
So you had gone, no word of farewell;
I didn't realize.
I may have hurt you, I couldn't tell;
It wasn't in your eyes.
[Chorus:]
Can't make up my mind.
Can't make up my mind.
