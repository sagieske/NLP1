Song:

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them.

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me.

--- Instrumental ---

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me...
