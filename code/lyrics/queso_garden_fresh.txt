Song:

Don't wanna waste my time
I'm gonna make you high
We're gonna stay
We'll have the music loud
We'll find the candle lights
We're gonna stay
Don't wanna waste my time
I'm gonna make you high
Don't wanna waste my time
We're gonna stay

Feel alright
Dance tonight
Girls are fine
Can't complain
Can't complain

Inside my room
Can we talk for awhile

Don't wanna waste my time
We're gonna make you high
We're gonna stay
We'll have the music loud
We'll find the candle lights
We're gonna stay

Feel alright
Dance tonight
The girls are fine
Can't complain
Can't complain

Inside my soul
Make me high
Make me high

Make me hig

Selfish side

Don't wanna feel the pain

Keep dancing in the rain

Feel alright
Dance tonight
Girls are fine
Can't complain
Can't complain

Inside my soul
Make me high
Make me high

Make me high
