[Tech N9ne]
Ain't no way you bout to stop this sickness
From the deepest, darkest part of misery, psycho, alpha, schizo
Get your chick, she diggin me
A. B. S. O. L. You. T. E. P. O. W. E. Are.
See me clownin, look at all you player haters frownin
Raw, God said kill'em all
Tech's backs to the wall
Fightin for my life and imma bust back till they fall
And I ain't even slangin them thangs
I'm hollerin 187 if you trippin with Strange
I'm really real with it
Like my homey A. J. Say deal with it
Pushin and pullin and fightin for the meal ticket
In a minute imma do it like a villain
Imma get'em in the middle of a Bomb
Put'em on the spot till the funk go pop and
And I bet they never have another quam
Tech nizzle
When I'm thizzled it's who be you
Rollin' with Dave, Trav, Violet Brown and 3-D-Q
Hootie Hoo, for those who not knowin that Missou the true
Imma tell ya like the Swedish would say it
Sug Min Kuk!

[Chorus][2X]
Absolute power
That's the only way to roll
Absolute power
They love us everywhere we go
Absolute power
Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute power
Absolute power

[Tech N9ne]
I do hip-hop and I mix it with the hard rock
Designing this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9ne, he's unwinding
The shining, it's blinding greedy
So we constantly grinding
I been in the game 16 years makin rap tunes
Raisin hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in 02' you can watch me clownin
Diamonds shinin, watchin dvd's on the Hachitachi
It's all Jesus, now I keep the crowds pumpin
They jumpin, get back to the tele
We rollin and stickin somethin
Racin to the main line
Absolute power is havin Halle Berry and Juliet Lewis at the same time
Oh, that's how Strange ni***z run
Listen to the villain with the gun associated tongue
We're close to the end but not done
The Tech's just began, begun, beginnin to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin to put me in the hearst
But I will not tumble first things first
Took a lot of s**t and I can't take more
F**k Jay Faires and everybody down wit'em
And f**k jcor!

[Chorus][2X]
Absolute power
That's the only way to roll
Absolute power
They love us everywhere we go
Absolute power
Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute power
Absolute power

[Tech N9ne]
Thanks to Strange Music, I'm comin
And all my enemies, they runnin
Now all my haters bummin cause I was summoned
We Kansas City players and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many points you got? I got fitty
Here's a question to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of ni***z in the city?
My villains are gritty
Big Scoob, Txx Will, Bakarii
Rest In Peace Short Nitty
Power with the evil way
It's power, what the people say
Rebel yellin, "we felons"
And my pockets are swellin
This beats from Berlin Germany throwin up Missizzy
So ain't no other city concerning me
I teach it and I speak it very loosely
Stamina gunnin got player haters runnin profusely
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me
'Cause they know that absolute power corrupts, absolutely

[Chorus][4X]
Absolute power
That's the only way to roll
Absolute power
They love us everywhere we go
Absolute power
Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute power
Absolute power
