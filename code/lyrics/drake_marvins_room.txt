[Drake - Verse 1]
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of my friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over yeah we threw a party
I was just calling cause they was just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Spreading that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

I'm just sayin', could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble
