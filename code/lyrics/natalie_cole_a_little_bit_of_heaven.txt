Song:

Written by richard kerr & graham lyle

The last guest has gone

I can tell you're as thankful as I

A good time was had by all

And a little wine

I know by that look

(hmm) you've got other things on your mind

And I can't resist that sign

So turn out the lights and close the door

We need the night to be alone

Shut out the world-just let it spin

Why don't we make a little bit of heaven

Just talk to my heart

(ooh) say the words that I want to hear

Darling, tonight I need you near

So turn out the light and close the door

We need some time to be alone

Shut out the world-just let it spin

And maybe we'll touch

A little bit of heaven

Oh---, oh, oh, hmm---

Shut out the world-just let it spin

Maybe we'll touch a little bit of heaven

Heaven's right here for us

We don't need a mountain to climb, no, no, no

There's just the two of us

And the love between the lines

Turn out the light and close the door

We need the night to be alone

Shut out the world just let it spin

Why don't we make a little bit of heaven

Turn out the light and close that door

Maybe we'll find a little bit of heaven

Turn out the light, baby, and close the door

I know we can make a little bit of heaven

Honey, turn out the light, yeah, and close the door

Maybe we'll find a little bit of heaven

Turn out the light and close the door

Maybe we'll find, oh, a little bit of heaven
