Song:

Come on, clap your hands, back it up

I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing

I told you from the start
Just how things would be
Expections for the one that would be with me
Now I tell you once again
I hope you'll understand
Just what you have to do
If you want a second chance
I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoted just to me
I need a one loving kind of woman
A woman that I can trust
Who's faithful and concerned about us
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing

A stylish kind of woman with class, looks real good
Who treats some man the way that she should
One who will give me all her love
One who will have me wanting more
That's the kind of woman I'm looking for
I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoted just to me
I need a one loving kind of woman
A woman that I can trust
Who's faithful and concerned about us
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing

I want the best
I won't settle for less
I want someone that is heaven sent
Someone to hold me tight
Someone who'll treat me right
And who'll understand
And treat me like a man
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing
I've gotta have all or nothing, baby
With me there is no maybe
If you want to be my lady
It's all or nothing
