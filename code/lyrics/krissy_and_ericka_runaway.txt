Song:

La la la la
Say it's true,
There's nothing like me and you
Not alone,
Tell me you feel it too

And I would runaway
I would runaway, yeah
I would runaway
I would runaway with you

Chorus:
Cause I-I-I - I have fallen in love
With you, no never Hey hey
I'm never gonna stop falling in love
With you
La la la la

Close the door,
Lay down upon the floor
And by candlelight,
Make love to me through the night

Cause I have runaway
I have runaway, yeah
I have runaway,
I have runaway with you

Chorus:
Cause I-I-I - I have fallen in love
With you, no never Hey hey
I'm never gonna stop falling in love
With you

With you...
Ooohh... Say it's true
