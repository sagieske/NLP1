Song:

Everything you say,
Is so predictable,
You're words don't mean a thing,
(Blah, blah, blah).

Why the masquerade?
You think you're funny,
Nut you'll never entertain,
(Haha, ha, haha).

I'll never be your appetizer melting on your tounge,
Here's a simple truth boy,
You just don't turn me on.

Chorus
(So) You think you're something special,
And you claim to be the next best movies star,
So superficial,
I don't buy your show,
Au Revoir.

(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir,
(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir,

Your always on a stage,
Not afraid to say you're fishing for the fame,
(Haha, ha, haha)
Boy you're not a saint,
Not irresistable in any kind of way,
(Haha, ha, haha)

Chorus

Let's keep it confidentual,
(Oh, oh, oh)
Boy you wanna show the world how cool you are,
No, no potential,
I don't buy your show.

Boy, you no good at breaking the ice,
Babe stop telling me lies,
You're not one of a kind,
Babe stop telling me lies.

Au Revoir
(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir,
(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir,

Chorus

Let's keep it confidentual,
(Oh, oh, oh)
Boy you wanna show the world how cool you are,
No, no potential,
I don't buy your show.
Au revoir.

Au Revoir
(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir,
(Bye)
Au-au-au-au-au-au revoir,
Au revoir
