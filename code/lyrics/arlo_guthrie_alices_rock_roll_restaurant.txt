Song:

You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant

Walk right in
It's around the back
'Bout a half a mile
From the railroad track
You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant

You can eat anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant
I said, you can eat anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant

See that man sitting
Down under the seat
Walk up and tell him
You want something to eat
Because you can eat
Anyone that you want at
Alice's Restaurant

Oh, oh, yeah, mmm...

I said
You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything
That you want just
As long as it's up front

Come on, baby
Know you could
Go ask your mama
If you should
Because you can get
Anything that you want at
Alice's Restaurant

You can get anything
That you want at Alice's
Rock and Roll Restaurant
You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant

Mama, walk in
It's around the back
'Bout a half a mile
From the railroad track
I said, you can get anything
That you want at Alice's
Rock and Roll Restaurant, yeah

Whoa, mama, said yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I walk in
Round the back, honey
Half a mile from
The railroad track

Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything
That you want at
Alice's Restaurant

You can get anything
That you ever did want, babe
At the restaurant

I said, walk in, honey
You can want what you get
Baby, you get it, you bet

I said, walk in
Walk in around the back
Half a mile from the track

You can get anything you want
