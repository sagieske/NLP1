Song:

Beyond this road, running on far and long
Must surely be something we can believe in

If, like a traveler in the wind
You went on, aiming for the northern skies

The hot emotions that have begun to disappear
Glitter and wave once more
Within my heart

I don't want to cry, you see
So I don't give in to my weak self

Huge wings
Unseen only by eyes
Held by undecorated hearts

Spread your hands; while singing
Be embraced by eternal time
And connect with life

(repeat)

Japanese:

Nagaku tsukuzu kono michi no mukou ni
Shinjirareru mono ga kitto aru

Kaze no naka no tabibito no you ni
Kita no sora o mezashite ikeba

Kiekaketa atsui omoi
Mou ichido mune no naka de
Kagayaki yureru

Namida nante koboshitakunai no
Yowai jibun ni makenai tame ni

Kazaranai kokoro dake ga
Motte iru me ni wa mienai
Ooki na tsubasa

Te o hiroge utainagara
Yuukyuu no toki ni dakare
Inochi o tsunagu

(kurikaeshi)
