Song:

Sun turning 'round with graceful motion
We're setting off with soft explosion
Bound for a star with fiery oceans

It's so very lonely, you're a hundred light years from home

Freezing red deserts turn to dark
Energy here in every part

It's so very lonely, you're six hundred light years from home

It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're a thousand light years from home

Bell flight fourteen you now can land
Seen you on Aldebaran, safe on the green desert sand
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
It's so very lonely, you're two thousand light years from home
