Song:

I guess you know I'm bad, bad
I got a problem, I need you to promise

Nicole:
Shopaholics why they call 'em my addiction, my prescription, 
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want I need 'em bad

All them girls be checking my bags
Buy it they be wanting my swag
I guess you know I'm Bad (Bad)

What a bad little girl I am
I got a problem (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise
(Bad bad bad bad bad bad) Bad

What a bad little girl I am
I got a problem (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise
(Bad bad bad bad bad bad)

You no bargain me no sale, I want the best I dress me well, 
Loves Gabany, tempting Versace, 
Chick ain't cheap and everybody knows

All them girls be checking my bags
Buy it they be wanting my swag
I guess you know I'm bad (bad)

(Bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I got a problem (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(Bad bad bad bad bad bad)

What a bad little girl I am
I got a problem (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
I need you to promise
(Bad bad bad bad bad bad)
