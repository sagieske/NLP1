Song:

This is my testimony everybody, how God favored me in spite
Of my enemies, and if God did it for me he'll do the
Something for you. Don't worry about your haters your haters
Can't do nothing with you. Listen to these words

Verse 1
Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when
It's genuine, but I've had my share of love, abuse, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

I'm still here, I'm still alive, I'm still blessed, on my way to
My destiny, because the favor of God is on my life. Let me
Tell you about love.

Verse 2
Love is patient, caring. Love is Kind. Love is felt most when
It's genuine, but I had my share of love, abuse, manipulated
And it's strength misused, and I can't help but give you glory,
When I think about my story, and I know you favored me
Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me
Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

Verse 3
They whispered, conspired, they told their lies (God favors me)
My character, my integrity, my faith in God (He favors me)
Will not fall, will not bend, wont compromise (God favors me)
I speak life and prosperity and I speak health (God favors me)

Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Say Yes (Yes) God favors me (God favors me)
