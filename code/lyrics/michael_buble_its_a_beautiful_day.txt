Song:

I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
While I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

Pre Chorus
'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

Chorus
Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If I'm drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
Now I'm alright
Might've had me caged before, but not tonight

Pre Chorus
'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say 'so long', I just want to say 'goodbye'

Chorus
Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If I'm drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You won't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away

'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
My time with thinking of our break-up
Then, you've got another thing coming your way
'Cause it's a beautiful day
Beautiful day
Oh, baby, any day that you're gone away
It's a beautiful day
