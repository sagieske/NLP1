Now is the time for all people
From every land to come together
Now is the moment for worship
We enter in withholding nothing

He is worthy exalted
He's high and lifted up

Chorus:

Sing, sing unto the Lord
Open up you heart
Make a joyful noise
In the sanctuary
Sing, sing unto the Lord
Lavish Him with love

Let the praises ring
In the sanctuary
Sing

Now is the time for all people
From every land to come together
Now is the moment for worship
We enter in withholding nothing

(Because) You're worthy, exalted
You're high and lifted up

(Chorus)

Bridge:

Gotta open up your mouth and give Him praise
Open up your heart and give Him praise
Lift up holy hand unashamed
In the sanctuary

Gotta open up your mouth and give Him praise
Open up your heart and give Him praise
Lift up holy hand unashamed
Sing Sing Sing

Sing unto the Lord
Open up you heart
Make a joyful noise
In the sanctuary
Sing unto the Lord
Lavish Him with love
Let your praises ring
In the sanctuary

(Chorus)
