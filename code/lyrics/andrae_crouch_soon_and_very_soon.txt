Song:

Soon and very soon we are going to see the king
Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king X3

No more crying there, we are going to see the king
Hallelujah, hallelujah, we're going to see the king X3

Bridge:
Should there be any rivers we must cross
Should there be any mountains we must climb
God will supply all the strength that we need
Give us strength till we reach the other side.

Verse:
We have come from every nation, 
God has already signed our name.
Jesus took his blood and he washed my sins, he washed them all away.
Yet there are those of us who have laid down our lives
But we all shall meet again on the other side.
