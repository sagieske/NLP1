Song:

I've got a special power
That I'm not afraid to use
Every Wakie hour
I discover something new

So come on this is my adventure
This is my fantasy
It's all about living in the ocean
Being wild and free

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld
Land or sea
The worlds my oyster
And I'm the pearl
No ordinary girl

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld
Land or sea
The worlds my oyster
And I'm the pearl
No ordinary girl

We've got to stick together
Cause the best things come in three
I want it to last forever
All the magic and fun at sea

So come on this is our adventure
There's no telling were we'll go
But all I want is to live against the H2o

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue under world
Land or sea
I've got the power if I just believe

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld
Land or sea
The worlds my oyster
I'm the pearl
No ordinary girl

Come on it just gets better
So much to do and such little time
Cause it all depends on whether
You wanna leave the land above behind

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld
Land or sea
I've got the power if I just believe

Cause I'm no ordinary girl
I'm from the deep blue underworld
Land or sea the worlds my oyster
And I'm the pearl no ordinary girl
