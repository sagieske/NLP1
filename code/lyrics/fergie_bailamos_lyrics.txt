Song:

Whoo Whoo Whoo Come on y'all Whoo
Keep movin and movin and movin it
Keep movin and movin and movin it
Keep movin and movin and movin it
Keep movin and movin and movin it
Like this like that like this whoa
Can you feel the light
It's a full moon tonight
So bring your appetite
To feast on the mood
Drink up the groove
Feel the bass in your bones
As the horns make you moan
Let the drums take the throne
And get in the mood
Slide in the groove

[Bridge:]
Cause I really want to see you dancing
I really want to see you movin
There's a party on a boat we cruise in whoa
[Chorus:]
If your feeling like I'm feeling
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop, move your body
Give it all you got, now everybody,
Bailamos! Bailamos!
Feeling like I'm feeling
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop, move your body
Give it all you got, now everybody
Bailamos!

Now there looking your way
As your starting to sway
To the band as they play
So feast on the mood drink up the groove
Move your hips
Shake your thang
Tell the guitar to sang
Hear your fever bells ring
Now piano grooves

[Bridge:]
Cause I really want to see you dancing
I really want to see you movin
There's a party on a boat we cruise in whoa
[Chorus:]
If your feeling like I'm feeling
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop, move your body
Give it all you got, now everybody,
Bailamos! Bailamos!
Feeling like I'm feeling
Then move your body
Don't stop, don't stop, move your body
Give it all you got, now everybody
Bailamos! [x2]

I'm feeling balalalalalalamos whoo...
