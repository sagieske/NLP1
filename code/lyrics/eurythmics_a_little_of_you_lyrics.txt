Song:

There used to be a time
I wore my heart upon my sleeve.
There used to be a time
I'd show my gentle side to anyone
Through these years of wandering
I know I've been deceived.
Through these years of wandering...
And everytime you try to hurt me
You know you'll only hurt yourself.
And everytime you try to hurt me
I know you'll be the one to suffer
When you think you're hurting someone.
A little of you - a little of me -
A little of you -
Is hurting someone -
Don't tell me I'm the only one
'Cause I don't need that space.
Don't ask for love
I'll throw it back in your face.
All of these promises
Were only made to break.
All of these promises...
(Chorus repeats...)
