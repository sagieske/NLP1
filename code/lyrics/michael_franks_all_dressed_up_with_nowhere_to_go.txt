Song:

The night I met you
We were tryin' to define
What "hip" meant
How could I forget you
You were shakin' all that fine
Equipment?
Listen you, 's' been a week or two
And still you got me waiting
Anticipating
Little fawn did you lead me on
Because you really want it
Or just to flaunt it
What you tryin' to do?
You can't shift this thing
From high down into low
It's a shame just a game
And I'm blamin' you
'Cause now I'm all dressed up and I got
Nowhere to go
You're so bitter sweet
The sign says, "All that you can eat"
But I still ain't seen it
And I've heard it said
That a lady dressed in red
Don't really mean it
Listen you, 's' been a week or two
And still you got me waiting
Anticipating
Little fawn did you lead me on
Because you really want it
Or just to flaunt it
What you tryin' to do?
You can't shift this thing
From high down into low
It's a shame just a game
And I'm blamin' you
'Cause now I'm all dressed up and I got
Nowhere to go
What you tryin' to do?
You can't shift this thing
From high down into low
It's a shame just a game
And I'm blamin' you
'Cause now I'm all dressed up and I got
Nowhere to go
What you tryin' to do?
You can't shift this thing
From high down into low
It's a shame just a game
And I'm blamin' you
'Cause now I'm all dressed up and I got
Nowhere to go
What you tryin' to do?
You can't shift this thing
From high down into low
It's a shame just a game
And I'm blamin' you
'Cause now I'm all dressed up and I got
Nowhere to go
