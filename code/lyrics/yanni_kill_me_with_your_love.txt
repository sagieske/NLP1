Song:

Tell me who you are today
Did you leave the best with the words you won't say
Different man, different heart
Now we stand worlds and worlds apart

Underneath the ruins that lie
A broken rhythm keeps running through my mind
Color it is all I see
But I don't bother the remains of you and me

And I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all

Lives touched with lies in this room
Vacant memories haunt me through and through
Descending from this high
Silence fills the void with a fire dye

And I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all

And I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all

Your words mean nothing at all
And I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
I trust you to kill me with your love
Your words mean nothing at all
