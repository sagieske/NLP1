Song:

It's hard to loose, a heart so true
Without a fight
Lost my little angel somehow
She might as well be in Texas by now
She sure isn't here
She sure isn't in my arms
I know she's in the Goddamn town some where
I drive past her house, but she's never there
She's got a new boy; she's probably in his arms
It's hard to lose, a heart so true
Without a fight
I know she drives these streets around here, but our paths never cross
And she's disappeared, well if I decide -----?----- to find
But I lost my little angel somehow
She might as well be in Texas by now
I just want to see her, and see if she's looking for me
It's hard to lose, a heart so true, without a fight.
It's hard to lose, a heart so true, without a fight, Lord knows, without a fight
It's hard to lose
A heart so true, without a fight
