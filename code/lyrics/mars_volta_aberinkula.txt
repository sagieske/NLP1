Song:

Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

Am I the one you're after
The novice made to find
Stray abhoration stalking
Plans that forgot me 99 times
The only thing to alter
Stands in the way of you
I want your cramps to fit
The fillings of my teeth

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

And don't you try and ask me
Your expiration date
The plans that forgot me 99 times
You'll be the one who opens the gate
Carry water in a basket
Where the hole was dug the first time
The head that carries the body
A blood that flows through veins

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

When it calls I'll answer
Do you need to repent?
The plans that forgot me 99 times
I'll stick around for 99 times
The fault lines you prepare have darkened
Blank rings instead of sight
Goliath, are you receiving?
Dismembered, you've arrived

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well
