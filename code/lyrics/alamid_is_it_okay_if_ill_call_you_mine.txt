Song:

Is it okay if I'll call you mine
just for a time
and I will be just fine
If I know that you know that I'm
wanting needing your love
Ohh...

If I ask of you is it alright
If ask you to hold me tight
Through a cold and dark night
cause there maybe a cloudy day inside
and I need to let you know that I might
be needing your love
Ohh..

And what I'm trying to say
isn't really new
It's just the things that happen to me
when I'm reminded of you

Like when I hear your name
Or see a place that you've been
or see a picture of your grin
or pass a house that you've been in
one time or another
It sets of something in me I can't explain
And I can't wait to see you again
Oh babe I love your love
Ohh....

And what I'm trying to say isn't really new
It's just the things that happened to me
when I'm reminded of you.
