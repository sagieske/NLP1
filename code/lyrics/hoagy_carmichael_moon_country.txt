Song:

I long for that moon country
That possum and coon country
That sycamore heaven back south
I’ll lose my mind till I get there

I long for that old country
That good for the soul country
With folk cooking things
That melt in your mouth

Mmm, when my cousin, Cindy Lou
Plays a twilight hymn to you
She makes that old piano
Sound exactly like brand new

I long for that moon country
That’s where I should be
‘Cause that old moon country
Is home to me
