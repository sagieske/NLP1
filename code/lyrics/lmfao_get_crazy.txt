Song:

Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something
If you wanna have fun and do something
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something
If you wanna have fun and do something

Walk in the club with no I'd
Girls on my jock cause I'm vip
Your man can't do what I can do
What's your name - I'm Skyblu
Well I'm Redfoo with the big a** fro
Never wear lenses in my glasses yo
My first keyboard was a Casio
Oooh look at that girl on the dancin' floor
Was she lookin at us like she wanna do
Somethin freaky in the back with a camera crew
I guess I got time for a fan or two
I roll with 3 hos like Santa do
Ho, Ho, Ho and a bottle of goose
Mix it with the bull if you wanna get loose
It's that time to lose control
If you're feelin' real good then let it show

Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties

When I was a baby I was suckin on titties
Now that I'm older still suckin on titties
Different titties - but titties nonetheless
The first thing I do when a girl undress
Crazy girl spark my interest
If titties were a stock I'd invest in breast
Love the way you move I'm impressed
Lotta girls love us we the best I guess hey

I got the goose alright ok
I'm feelin loose alright ok
She love the beats alright ok
We love them D's alright ok
I got the goose alright ok
I'm feelin loose alright ok
She love the beat alright ok
We love them D's

Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties

If you in the car flash yo titties
If you at the bar flash yo titties
If you at the beach flash yo titties
If you on the street flash yo titties
I said if you in the car flash yo titties
I said if you at the bar flash yo titties
If you at work flash yo titties
Even if you at church flash yo titties

In Europe they show t-titties all the time
But here in la every titty a prize
So girl let me see what you tryin to hide
Has either of your titties ever touched the sky
Now if your shy (if your shy)
Just close your eyes (just close your eyes)
And pull your titties out like you part of tha African tribe

Gon foo (foo)
Gon foo (foo)
Gon foo (foo)
Gon foo (foo)
Gon foo (foo)
Gon foo (foo)

I'm Sky Blu and that's my n***a

Redfoo (foo)
Sky Blu (Blu)
Redfoo (foo)
Sky Blu (Blu)
Redfoo (foo)
Sky Blu (Blu)

And L-M-F-A-O is the crew crew crew

I got the goose alright ok
I'm feelin loose alright ok
She love the beats alright ok
We love them D's alright ok
I got the goose alright ok
I'm feelin loose alright ok
She love the beat alright ok
We love them D's

Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
Get crazy get wild
Let's party get loud
If you wanna have fun and do something crazy fa-flash yo titties
