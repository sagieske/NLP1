Song:

My life is right here...
Oh, oh, oh...
Whoah...

You got this young girl, she's so cute
Everytime I see her, wear a fresh pair of shoes
'Cause this young girl, she's such a killa
Can't wait til I have it, I'ma spend half a milla

I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favourite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video
I could look at you all day
You make do my two-step all day
You keep me looking fly for ya all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
Well, like a hit on my radio, radio

You got this young boy, racking his brains
Trying to make you mine, but I don't got a ring
You got this young boy, going insane
Tell me that you're single and you're waiting for me
I can see us together on top
We livin' like we hit the jackpot
Cha-ching, like money in the bank
You should be with me

You're like my favourite song
On the radio, radio, radio, radio
I could listen to you all day
You're like a music video, video vi-vi-video
I could look at you all day
You make do my two-step all day
You keep me lookin' fly for ya all day
So you should be my girlfriend all day
Well, like a hit on my radio, radio

Day-ay-yay-yay, singing to this song
All day-ay-yay-yay

Stopped me in my tracks, I had to know your name
Nik Nak Patty, got a fine lil' swag
You and me together is a match, a match

Tell me, baby, why you makin' me wait all day
Nik Nak Patty, got a fine lil' swag
You and me together girl, we got it in the bag

You're like my favorite song on the radio, radio, radio, radio
