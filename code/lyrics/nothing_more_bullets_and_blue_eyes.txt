Song:

These dark and cloudy ideas are grounding my head down
With bullets and blue eyes, and a white flag disguise
Pull up the sheets and sing me back to sleep

What would you say?
What would you do if I told you our love was through?
If I walked out the door, left your heart on the floor?

I'm tired of holding my breath for countless days now
I bet you're someone you cannot recognize
Can you look yourself in the eyes?

What would you say?
What would you do if I told you our love was through?
If I walked out the door, left your heart on the floor?
If you were to stay, what would you change?
What would you do to prove?
Could you die to yourself just to love someone else?

Hold me, Hold me, Hold me, closer
You never hold me when you're sober
To hell with our love
You drink the blood
And I'll drink the wine
