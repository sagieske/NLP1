Song:

You're my darlin', darlin' baby
You're my darlin', darlin' love
You're my darlin', darlin' baby
I said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as I may live

Ooh, you're my darlin', darlin' baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady
I said you're the one that I always dreamed of in a woman
I'll give all that I can give

I'll give you plenty love
Because you deserve the best
You should everything a queen sittin' on a throne should have
You deserve to have it all
And I'm gonna do my best to give it to you, to give it to you, to give it to you

Ooh, you're my darlin', darlin' baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady
I said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman
And as long as we may live

I'll give you plenty love
Because you deserve the best
'Cause you're better than the rest
You're my queen on a throne, the one that I want to own
And all the things that you desire
I'll do my best to give it to you, to give it to you, to give it to you

Ooh, you're my darlin', darlin' baby
You're my sweet and tender love
You're a very special lady
You're my (Darling, darling), come on, come on
Baby, you're my (Sweet and tender)
Ooh, you're my (Very special lady)
And I need you (Darling, darling), oh, baby
Well, ah, you're my (Sweet and tender)
Baby, you're my (Very special lady)
Well, well, you're my (Darling, darling)
You deserve to have the best (Sweet and tender)
Believe me, baby 'cause you're (Very special lady)
Better than the rest, you're so much better, you're my (Darling, darling)
Oh, ooh, well, you're my (Sweet and tender)
You can believe you're my (Very special lady)
Girl, I just wanna give it to you (Darling, darling)
Give it to you, give it, give it, give it to you, you're (Sweet and tender)
Ooh... You're my (Very special lady)
