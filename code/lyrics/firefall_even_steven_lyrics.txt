Song:

(Rick Roberts/Larry Burnett)
Stevie, don't you let her go
Don't you have the sense to know
The love your leavin'
If you let her walk away
Loneliness is gonna take away your meanin'
Don't be scared of speakin' your mind
Everyone gets lonely sometime---
Even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven
Stevie, what is wrong with you
Treatin' her the way you do
With no good reason
Stevie, won't you ever learn
What you get is what you earn
An' now she's leavin'
Loved you more than words could explain
Don't be scared to love her the same
Even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven
I get the feelin' maybe Stevie might be
Dreamin' it all away
Stevie says he doesn't care
If she's gone or if she's there
I don't believe him
If he doesn't know he's wrong
He'll find out before too long
That empty feelin'
No one sees the things that you hide
Lookin' good but losin' inside
Even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven, even Steven
