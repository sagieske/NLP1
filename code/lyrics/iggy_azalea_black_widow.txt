Song:

[Hook: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby

[Iggy Azalea:]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something liking to loving
It was us against the world now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I Wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Hook: Rita Ora]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Hook: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby

[Iggy Azalea:]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doing whatever works
You've never met nobody
That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus hallelujah
I'm a make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breath for it
Till you do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean for
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I wouldn't promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back go quick
Cause this here is fatal attraction so I take it all or I don't want shit

[Pre-Hook: Rita Ora]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

[Hook: Rita Ora]
I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
Gonna love you, gonna love you
Like a black widow, baby
