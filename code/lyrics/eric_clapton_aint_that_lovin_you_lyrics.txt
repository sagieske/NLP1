Song:

By jimmy reed

You don't know me, baby,
Like I know myself.
I just want to love you, baby,
But you leave me on the shelf.

Aint that lovin you, baby?
Aint that lovin you, baby?
Aint that lovin you, baby?
But you don't even know my name.

Let me tell you something,
I swear to God it's true.
If you give your love to me,
Im gonna give it all to you.

You know it's true.

Chorus

They may kill me, baby,
And bury me like they do.
My body will lie, but my spirits gonna find
Only you.

Chorus
