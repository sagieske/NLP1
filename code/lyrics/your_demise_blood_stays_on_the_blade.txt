Song:

Bleeding knuckles and broken smiles
With these friendships gone, I see it all worthwhile
And still I can't see myself apologizing to anyone
For something I never done

There's no point in trying hard
To be a nice person or make myself seem kind
Cos I burn bridges and never stop
Hating the person you always was

I wont always reprimand
It takes to long for you to understand
The blood stays on the blade
And blood drips from the knuckles of my hand.

I'm not trying to make out I fight
But I've been brought up to do what's right
And in my opinion despising you
Is the heritage and basics of everything I ever learned

Bleeding knuckles and broken smiles
Even when I'm down I seem to always try again
And once again I'm down and out
But since you got finished I never see you around

You found your place away from us
Keep yourself hidden and you couldn't a f**k
But we're not worried there's enough of us
And I'm round here like yet another sitting duck

I see your life, It's different from mine
You see yourself important and I'm a waste of time
And there's your life, It's different from us
You seem to have it in your head that your above. (us all?) [x2]

First blood bit

Beatdown

Bleeding knuckles and broken smiles
With these friendships gone - I see it all worthwhile
And still
I can't see myself apologizing to anyone
For something I never done

There's no point in trying hard
To be a nicer person or make myself seem kind, cos I
Hold grudges and never stop
Hating the person that you always was

You always change your mind (You hypocrite)
If not you f*****g lie (You piece of shit)
When everyone else has forgiven you
I'll still hate you the same as day f*****g one

Bleeding knuckles and broken smiles
I'm staying true to myself for once
I hate your life
