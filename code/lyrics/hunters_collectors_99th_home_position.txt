Song:

If the man must be
Sleepin' at home all the time
And the woman must be
Out workin' all the time...
Yeah, no matter which,
No matter which woman he has
And no matter how many
How many men she has
They all gotta go...
Back to home position
They all gotta know
The 99th home position
Do you wanna work?
Do you wanna be sanctified?
Oh do you wanna come round?
Do you wanna be right--do you wanna be right?
Yeah see you in the desert, see you in the town,
Here's your precious life
Buried underground
I hear you singin'
Hear you comin' round
Now you are lost--
Do you wanna be found?
Do you wanna be found?
Hear me call...
Hear me call
Do you wanna know...
The 99th home position
Yeah the man must take her
Indoors all the time
And the woman must take him
Outdoors all the time
Yeah no matter which
No matter which man she keeps
And no matter how long,
No matter how long he sleeps
They all gotta go...
Back to home position
They gotta know...
The 99th home position
They all gotta know...
The 99th home position
