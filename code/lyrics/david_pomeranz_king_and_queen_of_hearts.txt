Song:

We're the king and queen of hearts
Hold me when the music starts
All my dreams come true
When I dance with you

Promise me you're mine tonight
I've been waitin' lyin' tonight
While the lights are low
I'll never let you go

(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)

You know it's not my imagination
Or a part of the orchestration
Love was here at the culmination
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts

Time will pass and tears will fall
But someday we'll both recall
Moments made of this
Golden memories

(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)

In a once and future dream
Where the dances never seem to start

(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever
In a wish that we made together
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)
