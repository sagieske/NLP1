Trapgold...

I got twenty racks on my new jeans
I got ten more in my blue jeans
I walk in then I turn up
Pimp tight liked I'm permed up
I heard broke b*****s talkin' like they rollin' like us
Man, these b*****s sound shermed up
And these b*****s be mad at us
Because these b*****s so down to f**k
Claim that s**t
I can bang that s**t
F**k me, f**k a ten, I'mma train that b***h
I hope you ain't wife that b***h
Cuz I know a couple homies that'll pipe that b***h
Lights out
Put you in a night gown
And your b***h chose me because you walk out with
My a** sick and my drinks mixed
Say I'm sicker say no s**t

And all my flows...
Closed case, I'm killin' s**t
Heard you flung, not feeling s**t

My brand right and I'm on one and these b*****s don't want none
(These b*****s don't want none)

I shine right cuz I grind, b***h hated on mine
My heart tatted, I'm authentic it's clear to see it's my time (x4)
