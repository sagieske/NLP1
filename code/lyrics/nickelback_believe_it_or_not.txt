Song:

Believe it or not,
Everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not,
Everyone keep most things inside

Believe it or not,
Everyone believe in something above
Believe it or not
Everyone need to feel loved,
Feel loved
But we don't, and we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us,
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find
But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out

I've seen it a lot, every time,
The world turns upside down
Believe it or not,
Most of us feel like we're losing ground
Believe it or not,
Everyone hate admitting fear

Believe it or not,
Most of us wanna know why we're here,
Why we're here
But we don't, and we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us,
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find

Someone deliver us,
Just send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find
But you don't, you won't,
Until we figure out

Most of us have nothing to complain about
Most of us have things we could live without
Everyone need advice on how to get along
You don't, we won't
Until we figure out

Believe it or not everyone (everyone...)
Believe it or not,
Everyone have things that they hide
Believe it or not,
Everyone keep most things inside

Believe it or not,
Everyone believe in something above
Believe it or not,
Everyone need to feel loved,
Feel loved
But we don't, and we won't
Until we figure out

Could someone deliver us,
And send us some kind of sign?
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find

Someone deliver us,
Just send us some kind of sign
So close to giving up,
'Cause faith is so hard to find

But you don't, and you won't
Until we figure out
You don't, and you won't
Until we figure out
