Song:

Well I've been down to Georgia
I've seen the streets in the west
I've driven down the 90, hell I've seen America's best
I've been through the Rockies, I've seen Saskatoon
I've driven down the highway 1, just hoping that I'd see you soon

Cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I've never been to Alaska, but I can tell you this
I've been to Lincoln, Nebraska and hell you know it aint worth s**t
I've been through Nova Scotia, Sydney to Halifax
I'll never take any pictures cause I know I'll just be right back

Cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I've seen palaces in London; I've seen a castle in Wales
But I'd rather wake up beside you and breathe that ol familiar smell
I never thought you could leave me, I figured I was the one
But I understand your sadness, so I guess I should just hold my tongue

But I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I know we're takin' chances, you told me life was a risk
But I have just one last question:
Will it be my heart or will it be his?

Coming home, I'm coming home
