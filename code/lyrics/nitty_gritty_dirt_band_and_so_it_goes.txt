Song:

A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see
But like any other house, it's only temporary
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart;
If there's no love inside, it'll soon fall apart.

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love

You can drive around in a long limosine
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing
He who'd walk a mile, just to hold an empty hand
Knows what it means, to be a wealthy man

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love

Worldly treasures will all pass away
There's just one thing that's put here to stay

Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
And so it goes, with everything but love
