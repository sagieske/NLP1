Song:

Buh buh buh buh buh buh
Da da da da da da
You went to school to learn girl
What you never never knew before
Like I before E except after C
Why 2 plus 2 makes 4 na na na
I'm gonna teach you
(teach you, teach you)
All about love girl
(all about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A B C easy as
1 2 3, oh simple as
Do re mi, A B C, 1 2 3 baby you and me girl(Repeat)

Come on let me love you just a little bit
I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out
Come on come on come on let me show you what it's all about

Reading and writing, arithmatic
All the branches of the learning tree
But listen without the roots of love everyday, girl
Education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you
(show you, show you)
How to get an A
(How to get an A)
Let me show you what you have to do
Listen to me baby that's all you gotta do

A B C, it's easy as
1 2 3, oh simple as
Do Re Mi, A B C, 1 2 3, baby you and me girl
A B C, it's easy it's like counting up to 3
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
(that's how easy love can be)
Sing a simple melody
1 2 3, you and me!

Sit down girl!
I think I love you!
No! Get up girl!
Show me what you can do.
Shake it shake it baby
Come on now
Shake it shake baby
Ooh ooh
Shake it shake it baby
Ho!
1 2 3, baby
Ooh ooh
A B C baby
Na na
Do re mi, baby
No!
That's how easy love can be
(A B C, it's easy it's lake counting up to 3
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
I'm gonna teach you how to sing it out!
Come on, come on, come on, let me show you what it's all about)
(Repeat chorus twice in parenthesis)
