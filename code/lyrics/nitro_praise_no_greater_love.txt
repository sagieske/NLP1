Song:

No greater love,
No greater love, yeah...
Yeah...

There's no greater love than Jesus.
There's no greater love than He gives.
There's no greater love that frees us.
So deep within.

There's no greater love than Jesus.
There's no greater love than He gives.
There's no greater love that frees us.
So deep within.

Yeah...

All the world's empty treasures will soon pass away,
But his love will last forever.
In my heart it shall remain.

There's no greater love than Jesus.
There's no greater love than He gives.
There's no greater love that frees us.
So deep within.

We praise your name, stand in awe
Of your never ending love.
Love so great, that it covers all my sin and shame.

No greater power, no.
There is no greater force in all the earth.
Than the strength of his love.

There's no greater love than Jesus.
There's no greater love than He gives.
There's no greater love that frees us.
So deep within.

We praise your name, stand in awe
Of your never ending love.
Love so great, that it covers all my sin and shame.

No greater power.
No greater force in all the earth
Than the strength of his love.

No greater love...
No greater love...
No greater love...
No greater love...
