Song:

I always had my eyes on you but you came from across the line.
I had to make good time to see you but you had to pay the fine.
All the boys on my side knew that you were the shark.
If you were found on the borderline you'd be shot in the dark.
Don't wear those clothes again, they don't make it in this crowd.
Don't go out D. T. K., you'll wear your best suit in the ground.
We're meeting in a neutral zone: the last car on the train.
The love you brought shaking up my bones and crawling through our veins.
We always met at the edge of a blade and we left at the end of the fight.
Of all the girls you've played and you laid why did this one have to be white?
They're gonna getcha at 12 o'clock high, got their sights set low on you.
You better believe me, I wouldn't lie.
We better quit before you're through!
They're gonna getcha at 12 o'clock high, got their sights set low on you.
You better believe me, I wouldn't lie.
We better quit before you're through!
