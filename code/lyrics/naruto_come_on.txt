Song:

Come on!
I hurry as if i“ëm being chased
My dread chest drives me to do so
Doing it for no one else, and it belongs to no one
Our now is...
Untie the pain, untie the heart, and untie the shadow
Hold your breath and cut throungh the darkness
Fightin and loving another...
... Will never end. On the way
I wanna rocks rocks to the chest.
