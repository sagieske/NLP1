Song:

They told you my name, now you think that you own me
We're living in ruthless times
In heartless times
This is the new life, this is the new power
The bitter point the linger of prejudice
But we will rise to break their accusations

I am the one, only reason
Never will be, never received
The first or the last
I am the one, only reason

We're blinded by the lies
The promise falsified
Let chaos rise
The strength in my soul is the power of knowing
That we are the have-nots but we will not
Beg or crawl
The sickness they sutler consumes and destroys them
A cancer of greed and deception
We stand. They fall, I spit, they crawl
They piss on everything

I am the one...

We're blinded...
Corrupt and divided the dream is derided
You're living by values created by twisted minds
You're trying to gag me, the word is hypocrisy
The gun is the symbol of freedom
Build new from old destroy, dispose, unite and justify

I am the one
We're blinded...
