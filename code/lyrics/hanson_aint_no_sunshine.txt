Song:

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Any time she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Any time she goes away (2X)

And I know (16x)

And I'll leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Any time she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away (3x)
