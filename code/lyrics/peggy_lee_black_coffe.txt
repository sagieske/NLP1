Song:

I'm feelin' mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in-between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down broom
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room
I'm talkin to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday
My Sunday dreams to dry
Now man is born to go a lovin'
A womans born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And down her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes
I'm moonin' all the mornin'
Mornin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around.
