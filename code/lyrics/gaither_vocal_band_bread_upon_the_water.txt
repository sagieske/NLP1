Song:

Well, there are people who think they’re not receiving
Anything from God at all
Oh, they are shaken from their believin'
When they don’t see results they quickly fall

But don’t you waiver, keep on living
In the way God wants you to
Don’t get discouraged keep on giving
Soon it will come back to you

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave
Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave

Good measure pressed down, shaking together, running over
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave

Oh, keep on working, seeking the kingdom
Instead of working for your needs
Just keep on sharing the love of Jesus
You know growing comes from planting seeds

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave
Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave

Good measure pressed down, shaking together, running over
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave

Every wave

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave
Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave

Good measure pressed down, shaking together, running over
Soon it's going to come back home

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on
Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home
Keep on casting, keep on casting
Soon it's going to come back home

Keep on casting your bread upon the water
Soon it's going to come back home on every wave
Keep on casting your bread upon the water
