Song:

There's something I gotta say to you
But I'm so afraid of what you'll do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'll just admit this to you now
That I'm stuck on you like glue somehow
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Don't want to feel so cold inside
I want to feel the warmth that I feel with you, all the time
Surrounding me just like the wind
Cause your the one who makes me sing...

Help me find myself, like how I found you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I need you so we can live happily too
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I just want youuu (X2)

I want to go out with you tonight,
A picnic with candlelight
I might just hold you tight

Tell me you wanna be my queen
If not, it's ok, a princess seems just my type
I promise I'll be there tonight

I wanna keep you warm in winter's white
And in the summer, walks on a beach sound nice

I need you now
To talk with on the phone for hours at a time
Baby, I just want you to be mine, all mine

Help me find myself, like how I found you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I need you so we can live happily too
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I just want you...

I want to be your Valentine,
Your Christmas wish, your pick up line

I want to be the one who knows about your friends and foes,
And the tv shows you love

Look above the stars,
Spell out your name with an exclamation point
'Cause at the end of the day,
You're the one who makes me say...

Help me find myself, like how I found you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
I need you so we can live happily too
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I Just Want You (x4)
