Song:

Stay With Me... And Never Let Me Know, 
Just To Celebrate The Notion... Stay With Me, Don't Go, 
Cause The Truth In Your Eyes... Is The Light In The Darkness, 
You Are My Love... My Infinite Love, 
There's No... Other Way That We Can Go, 
Way That We Need Be... Here Is The Prophecy, 
There's So, Much There... More Towering, 

Need Discovering... Be Empowering, 
Once You... Keep Something In, 
Keep Giving In... Keep Winning In With, 
Infinite Love... Once You, 
Keep Something In... Keep Giving In, 
Keep Winning In With... , 
Infinite Love... Is The Rain Falling Into The Sea
Infinite Love... Is The Miracle Showering Me... , 
Infinite Love... Is The Rain Falling Into The Sea
Infinite Love... Is The Miracle Showering Me... , 


I Say The Blind, The Blind... I Say The Blind Will See, 
Me Say Now Heed The Words... And We're Gonna Split The Sea, 
What Say What... Say What What... , 
Light A Candle... Me Say Donâ€™t Curse The Darkness, 
Make A Wish... Send It To The Heartless, 
Taking It Back In Time 500 Bc... , 
Taking It To The Future Historically, 
Infinite Love... Is The Rain Falling Into The Sea
Infinite Love... Is The Miracle Showering Me
Infinite Love... Is The Rain Falling Into The Sea
Infinite Love... Is The Miracle Showering Me
