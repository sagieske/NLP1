Song:

I see you there across the room and I wonder who you are.
My thoughts go back to childhood days when I wished upon a star.
It seemed back then that anything I wanted could come true.
But now it seems the only one I want to know is you.
I wonder if you're here alone and if you notice me.
Should I take your hand and dance with you in perfect harmony?
And when the time will come to leave will all my dreams come true?
Cause now it seems the only one I want to know is you.
I think of how we'll spend our time my love I give to you.
And as the years they pass us by still all I want is you.
And in my heart is where you'll be.
Cause all I want is you.
