Song:

[Chorus:]
Keep me sane in your arms tonight
Hold me close that I might not fall
But I know that we might be destined for life
A tragic flaw of mine...
Is running away.

Remember those nights, we stayed up just laughing on the phone
Remember that time you said that "I would never let you go"
Remember that time when I said that we could never ever be
But I know it's a lie because deep down inside

Is a coward hiding underneath all the silly games I play
With the batting of lashes and all the charming things I say
I'm an addict to the fact that I could lure you in with just a crack of a
Smile
But with you I might want to stay a while

[Chorus:]
Keep me sane in your arms tonight
Hold me close that I might not fall
But I know that we might be destined for life
A tragic flaw of mine...
Is running away.

Bridge:
Running away from what we could have been
I'm losing myself in this game that we're in
I didn't mean to let you in now everything is backfiring

[Chorus:]
Keep me sane in your arms tonight
Hold me close that I might not fall
But I know that we might be destined for life
A tragic flaw of mine...
Is running away.
