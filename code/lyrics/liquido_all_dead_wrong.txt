Song:

IT'S OVER,I'M OUT OF SIGHT AND I'M FEELIN'SO INVINCIBLE
I JUST CAN'T TURN BACK TIME,YOU'RE ALL DEAD WRONG
PITCHBLACK TIME,SO HARD TO TAKE
ALL I WANTED WAS TO TELL YOU HOW I FELT
LET'S TURN BACK TIME AND NEVER FORGET
ALL DEAD WRONG
REFRAIN:CLOSED UP/FOR LIFE/DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE IN
RECTIFY YOUR RECKONING
LET'S STOP THIS BOMB EXPLOTING
TURN LEFT/TURN RIGHT/(BUT)DON'T LET ANYONE ELSE IN
RECTIFY YOUR RECKONING
LET'S STOP THIS BOAT FROM SINKING
IT'S COLD OUTSIDE,I'M CREEPING HOME
IT'LASTS FOREVER,OHH I SWEAR,BUT I CAN'T SWIM ,I'M DROWNING IN TIME
IT'S OVER RIGHT,OVER RIGHT NOW,IT'S SIMPLE
REFRAIN:CLOSED UP....
.................................LET'S STOP THIS BAD MOON RISING
NO ONE STOPS A SINKING SHIP
PLEASE SAVE ME NOW,SAVE ME NOW I'M FALLING DOWN,SAVE ME NOW
SAVE ME FROM THE SYSTEM,SAVE ME NOW,SAVE ME FROM THE SYSTEM
REFRAIN:CLOSED UP.......
