Song:

Clenched fist I'm in a rage
I can't control my anger now
The more they lie to us
The more I want to bring them down
Everywhere we turn
We're being told how we should be
I feel like I'm being forced into a mold
That just doesn't fit me
From anger and rage
Comes rebellion
These money hungry men
Control our sight
And distort the truth that we so desperately seek
Telling us that we're wrong
For the way we live our lives
I know there are far too many
Who feel just like us
From anger and rage
Comes rebellion
Your billboard's temptation
Just a hangman's noose
A constant campaign
To sell us your "truth"
Can't live life on our knees
Or believe lies we're fed
Won't let them get to us
The movement's not dead
