Song:

Ambiguity makes people suffer much
The evidence of love cannot be found
When should I pursue?
When should I give up?
I can't even bring up the courage to hug you

I can only come with you this far
There some things we just can't do
Were more than friends
But not a couple yet
The scenery afar seemed to reigning soon

Should I cry or not?
Is it that I think too much of you?
I'm not convinced
And I start to suspect
The person with me
Is he still the same?
Is it you?

Ambiguity makes people suffer much
The evidence of love cannot be found
When should I pursue?
When should I give up?
I can't even bring up the courage to hug you

Ambiguity makes people more greedy
Until the waiting has lost it's meaning
However, you and I
Cannot be together
Let the memories of past
Stay here with me

Ambiguity makes people suffer much
The evidence of love cannot be found
When should I pursue?
When should I give up?
I can't even bring up the courage to hug you

Ambiguity makes people more greedy
Until the waiting has lost it's meaning
However, you and I
Cannot be together
Let the memories of past
Stay here with me
