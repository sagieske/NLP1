Song:

A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night
What a way to make an evenin' end right
The moo-oon was fine, the dancin' devine
Let's head for the drug store at Maple and Vine
Couples swayin' to a nickel machine
There's a corner where we'll never be seen
It's lovely to share that lover's delight
A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night
Now you can get most any flavour that you choose
There's vanilla, that'll thrill ya, down to your shoes
There's pistachio, and lemon pie
They've got a special sundae with a cherry on top
Lover's Lane, it just won't do
For real sweet romance lead me to -
A chocolate sundae on a Saturday night
What a way to make an evenin' end right
The moo-oon was fine, the dancin' devine
Let's head for the drug store at Maple and Vine
Couples swayin' to a nickel machine
There's a corner where we'll never be seen
It's lovely to share that lover's delight
A chocolate sundae on a Saturday ni-ight
