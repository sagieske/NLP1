[Liam] It's not me, it's not you, there's a reason
I'm just trying read the signals I'm receivin
It's like stone on fire, can you feel it
I don't know about you girl but I believe it

[Niall] Words will be just words...
Till you bring them to life

[Harry] I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world

[Zayn] Everyday, in every way... Ooooh
