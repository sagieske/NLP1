Song:

Break your neck for some substance
This is temporary sanity, an exercise in vanity
So long, to the ordinary day wrought with fictitious tales
Of how there's any other way
Hold on to anything at all
It's a long way down between the summer and the fall
If I told you that you're everything,
Would you sing along?
Would you sing along?

It's a daily anthem
Would you sing my song,
At the top of your lungs?
And we'll all sing along,
We'll all sing along
It's a half-faith blessing
For the lessons I've learned,
Never deserved.
And we'll all sing along,
We'll all sing along

Now the verses take hold,
A gentle undercurrent of more years to grow old
Say goodbye to the cold
And try to forgive everything this night
As we sing your daily anthem,
Would you sing my song,
At the top of your lungs?
And we'll all sing along,
We'll all sing along
It's a half-faith blessing
For the lessons I've learned,
Never deserved.
And we'll all sing along,
We'll all sing along
