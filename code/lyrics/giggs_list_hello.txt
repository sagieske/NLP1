Giggs-verse 1
They Aint got a girlfriend or something (haha)
They can't make tunes for the gyalem
Baby I'm looking a slice
When I am Jucking it right gotta look in eyes (jheese)
No complains I aint looking to fight
Coz ur tight pum pum got me living a lie

You know it aint like that I will be chilling a night

Giggs verse-2
Bad day cought me with a bag full of grade
Anyone can tell you felt bad for me babes
Sat day I was like grab me a trey
And when we are chilling out I put badness away (jhesse)
Why? Coz ur my princess
If you heard I had a shoot out
You were impressed
But chill out everything blessed
And she got my meal out and my ting pressed umm
Imma invest in your love zone general intressted
I know I am always in debt for keeping me in check
You know everything best (jhesse)
No telling my luck
I aint giving a f**k
Your iced out with delicate touch (shhh)
And you keep my intelligence up
And god knows I aint giving you up
[Chorus:]
