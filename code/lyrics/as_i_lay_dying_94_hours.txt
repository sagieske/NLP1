Song:

94 hours of regret for me to realize what I held
Unfading beauty, not just a face
I held it's innocence within my heart
Go!
Now I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't
I won't let go
I won't
I won't let go
The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul.
The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul.
The pain of a moment's time will forever beg your forgiveness
Forgiveness
94 hours for me to realize
I held unfailing beauty
I held your innocence
