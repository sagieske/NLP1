Song:

I'm looking down on the silver screen
I'm so happy I have never been
So many faces stare at me with ice
Now I have found my own paradise
I'm falling down to the corridor
Taking the beer to drink one more
I'd like to pull all stuff away
To today is my happy day

Happy day come to me
I wanna set you free
Happy day come to me

I love to watch it shining from inside
It takes my heart away I don't know why
It's telling only truth and never lies
Now I have found my own paradise
Glorious feeling that do make me cry
Shall stay forever holds me up too tight
My television shines on me this way
To today is my happy day
