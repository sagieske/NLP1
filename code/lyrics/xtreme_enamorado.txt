Xtreme
Na, na, ni, ni, ni, ni, na, na, na

Solo tenia 13 a? Os, era el a? O '96
Todavia era un ni? O que no entendia muy bien
Me enamore de una ni? A que por linda me sombre
Su bonita carita, su sonrisa de mujer
No se si yo le gustaba o le caia bien
Pero lo que sentia era un lido plaser
Una linda muchachita cuando me ablaba ingles
Yo le desia I Love you, I want to be your very best
Ella era la mami que me daba su querer
La que me acarisiabas con todo su ser....
Ser.....

Ay que lindo cuando dos personas estan enamorado
Lo que es amor, uno se pone medio loco
Cuando llega el amor
No le importa lo que digan, eso es amor...
A estar enamorado uno pierde la rason.

Xtreme......

Yo felas you ready to rip it

Check it out now

Uh

Llora mami llora desahoga te

Era el Viernes en la noche y a pena eran las dies
Yo estaba solito pensando en mi querer
Camine por su bario buscando a esa mujer
Y el besino me a ditcho que se fue y no vas a volver
Que dolor tan grande
Tenia yo en ese momento
Seme fue mi mami, seme fue bien lejo
Si ella supiera que la amava, y le daba mi amor
Me cojio de relajo me rompio el corazon

I thought I was in love but it was all a lie
I thought that it was true, and everything was fine
She made me feel so good and though so many cried
But when I looked at her my heart just fell inside
And then I knew that she was such a waste of time
I would have never known that it was a disguise
She told me all those lies and didn't realize
All the hurt that she would cause that hurt me deep inside
I hope that she had seen everything she did to me
I hope that she was pleased cuz it was killing me
Killing me....

I thought I was in love but it was all a lie
I thought that it was true, and everything was fine
She made me feel so good and though so many cried
But when I looked at her my heart just fell inside
And then I knew that she was such a waste of time
I would have never known that it was a disguise
She told me all those lies and didn't realize
All the hurt that she would cause that hurts me deep inside

Deep inside....
Mmmmm.....
