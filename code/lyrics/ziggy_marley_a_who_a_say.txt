Song:

A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah

They are crazy lazy
And full of intentions
Flakey, shakey
What a misinterpretation

A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A dem a say
A dem a say
A dem a say
A dem a say
A dem a say there ain't no Jah

Hedonist, sadist
Nazi intention
Masochism a devilizm
Is life's intervention

A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah

How could you say
How could you say there ain't no Jah
How could you say
How could you say
How could you say there ain't no Jah

The signs before us
Are simple and clear
Soon men will know
Only Jah to fear
They are crazy, lazy
Always inventing
Shakey, flakey

A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A who a say
A who a say
A who a say there ain't no Jah
A dem a say
A dem a say
A dem a say there ain't no Jah
But I a say
And high a say
And I a say there is a Jah
