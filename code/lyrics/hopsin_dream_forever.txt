[Verse:]
Your the only girl that never disrespected me
You always know how to bring out the best of me
Cupid shot us separately
Then we came together, it was destiny
I love until there ain't no loving left in me
Definitely
Our souls will ride together, even when the stars die
And when parted, my heart cries
Its angels like you, who make it hard why?
Its cause you beautiful
Outgoing and smart
And s**t you really set the bar high
All you bring to me is happy moments
You make me feel like I'm cute
Even though my face got all this acne on it
The way I feel for you, you can't revoke it
Cause it changed me, and my family knows it
Damn, we both just kind of just fell into this
You gave me proof that heaven exist
But tell me, what is love without a headache or twist?
You come taunting, every night after twelve
When I'm unconscious
You never come out when the suns watching
Baby, I need you

[Hook:]
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you

[Verse 2:]
I wake up in the morning
With this sensational pain
It goes straight to the brain
Then my day is invaded with rain
Engraved in my veins is your name
This ain't gonna change
It is staying remain
Unless my heart is deflated and drained
Your love is magic
Daydreaming about you is such a habit
Thought I saw you when I was driving
But I was stuck in traffic
If other girls flirt they're sadly mistaken
I tell em' scram
Cause they need to know I'm happily taken
You see my love life
It wasn't going well till I found you
Fellas get jealous and doubtful
When I tell em' about you
I know we had our fair share
In the past, with selfish lust
But once we came together
We sealed it and nailed it shut
Your touch is that of a goddess
When we kiss, I'm at a lack of words
Especially when we pull away
And then you smile afterwards
In our hearts, we're no different in color
We live for each other
I'm glad you're my significant other
I love you

[Hook:]
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you

[Verse 3:]

[Hook x2]
Where are you?
Are you only in my dreams?
Only when the moon is shining
That's when you are beside me
Girl, I need you
And that's real
I don't wanna wake up
I'll stay asleep (You know baby)
Your love is all I need
I'm really hoping I find you
