Song:

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand, and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbyes

[Chorus:]
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better, than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance, that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you - ooh'Ђ¦

Time can never mend
The careless whispers, of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is the whole you find

[Chorus:]
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better, than to cheat a friend (should have known better - yeah)
And waste a chance, that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ooh'Ђ¦

Never without your love

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe, it's better in this way
We'd hurt each other, with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived, this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

[Chorus:]
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better, than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance, that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you - ooh'Ђ¦

(Now that you're gone'Ђ¦) now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone'Ђ¦) was what I did so wrong - so wrong?
That you had, to leave me alone
