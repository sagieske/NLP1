Song:

Late at night, when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I wish on a star that, somewhere, you are
Thinking of me, too

'Cause I'm dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me

Wonder if you ever see me, and I
Wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes, would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?

I just wanna hold you close; but, so far
All I have are dreams of you
So I wait for the day and the courage to say
I love you
Yes, I do

I'll be dreaming of you tonight
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming about you and me

Ah, ah
(Corazуn)
I can't stop dreaming of you
(No puedo dejar de pensar en ti)
I can't stop dreaming
(Cуmo te necesito)
I can't stop dreaming of you
(Mi amor, cуmo te extraсo)

Late at night, when all the world is sleeping
I stay up and think of you
And I still can't believe that you came up to me
And said, "I love you."
I love you, too

Now, I'm dreaming with you tonight
'Til tomorrow and for all of my life
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly

Dreaming with you tonight
(With you tonight)
'Til tomorrow, I'll be holding you tight
And there's nowhere in the world I'd rather be
(Rather be)
Than here in my room, dreaming with you endlessly
