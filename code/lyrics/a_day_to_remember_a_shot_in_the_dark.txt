Song:

Lets take them back to the days
When we were family
My breath was your breath when we were young

I think it's funny how the times have changed
Throw being jealous in the mix
And now all I know of you is a name
Couldn't have came at a better time

This ends right now

We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
Were only hurting us
We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
Were only hurting ourselves

I'm a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends
And you act like you don't even know
It's cause you haven't been here for too long

I called this right from the start
I turn my back for one second now all I hear is a shot in the dark
Use my name like you know me
You're all the same

Keep running your mouth
Keep running your mouth
Oooooooh!

We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
Were only hurting us
We gave all of ourselves
To entertain you
Were only hurting ourselves

Hurting ourselves
Hurting ourselves
Hurting ourselves
Hurting ourselves

Mark my words were taking over the world
Mark my words were taking over the world
Mark my words were taking over the world
Mark my words were taking over the world
