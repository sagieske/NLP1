Song:

F**k!

These are the hardest four years of my life,
They walk right by me heads turned with closed eyes.
They don't even see me.
At night in my house I'm still all alone.
This is not a home.
They don't even see me.

The scars on my body, they don't even bleed.
I never do this for me.
The scars on my body, they don't even bleed.
I only do this for you to see.

How am I supposed to see through your eyes when you never saw the stars were falling at your feet?

Is it a song? Is that what they need?
For so long I've tried to get them to hear me.
Picking and stabbing, their words feel like knives.
Tearing and ripping the seams of my life.

I've tried to convince them
Their words hurt like stones.
I just wish they'd just leave me alone.

I am on my knees.
I need you to hear to me.
I am on my knees.
Hear me, please.

How am I supposed to, to hear what you hear when you never heard the sound of our glass hearts breaking with every tick of the clock when you are gone?

(How am I supposed to see through your eyes?)

I know what you've been through,
This hell was my life.
You have to keep pushing,
I've seen through your eyes.

Your days are like pages,
The chapters unread,
You have to keep turning
Your book has no end.
