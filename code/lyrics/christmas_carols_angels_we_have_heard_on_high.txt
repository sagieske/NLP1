Song:

Angels We Have Heard On High
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

Chorus:
Gloria In Excelsis Deo
Gloria In Excelsis Deo

Shepherds, why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
