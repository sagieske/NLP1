Song:

A world without heroes
Is like a world without sun
You can't look up to anyone
Without heroes
And a world without heroes
Is like a never ending race
It's like a time, without a place
A pontless thing
Devoid of grace

CHORUS:
Where you don't know
What you're after
Or if something's after you
And you don't know why
You don't know
In a world without heroes

In a world without dreams
Things are no more than they seem
A world without heroes
Is like a bird without wings
Or a bell that never rings
Just a sad and useless thing

Chorus x 5
