Song:

[Verse:]
Lookin' at an angel with the devil in her ear
Sayin' four letter words that'll make it in time
To everything she fears
Follow them and unclear whatever's in her head
Cause it burns, it gets worse, it's a curse
It should turn till pressure will appear

[Pre-Chorus:]
The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
Over.

[Interlude:]
Four star halo, away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, my mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get iron masked

[Chorus:]
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With the clip
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With the clip

[Verse:]
Lookin' at an angel with the devil in her ear
Now the roles are reversed, and she's breaking the curse
She's nearly in the clear
Fly away from anyone telling you to steer
To the person you were, cause without him you're perfect
Now heaven will appear

[Pre-Chorus:]
The snow falls for so long, you're frozen
Hold on, the cold war will be over
Over.

[Interlude:]
Four star halo, away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, my mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get iron masked

[Chorus:]
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With the clip
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With the clip

[Verse:]
Why do we all have to find love? Instead of just lettin' it find us?
I cannot tell if I'm blind drunk
Go live in a way that the sky does
I signed up for that mind f**k that that? Does
Wait for the day that that time's up
Cause I'm sick of just spendin' that time up
Feel like I'm loosing my head, few in the end
Don't want a funeral yet
Cannot go through it again
Feel like I'm ridin' the plot of a beautiful death
And they say that if you love somebody, set them free
So even thought the shit's hard to do, you gotta let me leave

[Interlude:]
Four star halo, away for a way to escape
But inside is an angel in hiding
Locked away, my mistakes are made by the chase
Caught up by the chance to get iron masked

[Chorus:]
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
With the clip
Spiral Down
Spiral Down
