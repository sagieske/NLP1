Song:

It never stops
We're living in a world of hatred, everything that you have ever loved will
Suffer
Dear God if you're here listening, don't you f*****g fail me now

Because it's never too late to die
Don't waste my motherfucking time
Hatred, hatred kills the things you love to pass the time
The sick and weak are the ones who get left behind
Your only hope is certain death
Your only hope is certain death
It's gonna f*****g kill us all
De-evolutionized and cursed
We're turning back, goddamn
We're becoming animals, killing instinctively
I've watched you fall a part

Open your eyes
Enjoy the serenade cause it wont last forever
Everything is so beautiful
Enjoy the serenade, it wont last forever
Everything is so beautiful
This ones out to all the shattered bruised and broken souls
Hold on tight cause there's no stops to where we're going
Hold on tight, it never stops
You're living in a world of hatred
Everything that you have ever loved will suffer
Dear God if you're here, don't you, don't you f*****g fail me now

Who's ever fantasized to live forever?
How could you be so blind?
The simple truth lies in us all
When will this all be over?
Withholding knowledge from the innocent to become immortal
Wheres your f*****g heart?
It's gonna kill us all
