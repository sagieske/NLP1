Song:

I wake up, I log in
Tweet what's going on
Where do I begin

Grab my phone, take a shot
For my instagram
Hashtag, bored again

Now we're ready here we go
A little prayer so we know
That we'll all be friends forever 'til the end

Yeah, I'm feeling all the good vibes
Oh, 'coz we're breakin' out 'til sunrise
Don't worry, be happy
Everything's alright (yolo)

Na nana na na
Nana na na na
Na nana na na
It's a new generation

Na nana na na
Nana na na na
Na nana na na
It's a new generation

Turn it on, turn it up
Switch your swaggers on
Dougie all night long

It doesn't matter what we do or where we go
'Coz what will happen we will never know

Are you ready for some more
'Coz we're breaking down the floor
C'mon everybody the gang's all ready

Yeah, I'm feeling all the goodvibes
Oh, 'coz we're breakin' out 'til sunrise
Don't worry, be happy
Everything's alright (let's go)

Na nana na na
Nana na na na
Na nana na na
It's a new generation

Na nana na na
Nana na na na
Na nana na na
It's a new generation
