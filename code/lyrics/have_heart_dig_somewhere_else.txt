Song:

The gold your greed is thirsting for
Is evil's root and the pride of fools, and you
I bet you thought I was kidding when I chose
To be broke in the most humble way
A concept of life you could never understand
An ideal too right for a business man
In the wrong f*****g place for the wrong f*****g things
You could never understand the things we sing
The greed, running inside your head
Is so insulting to us.
Doesn't it hurt when what you love is bought and sold?
A material world is what you're striving for
But the real gold is something you can't touch
It's in our hearts, not our wallets
And you're turning into something to fulfill
The greed, running inside your head
Is so insulting to us.
Doesn't it hurt when what you love is bought and sold?
And when it comes down to it
We don't need your, your greedy eyes and dollar signs
To cheapen the worth and lessen the value of all we know
We don't need your, your greedy eyes and dollar signs
When we got our true minds and humble hearts
The only tools we need for true growth.
And every dollar you f*****g make
Is more spit in my face
You can't sell your beliefs
If they really mean something to you.
