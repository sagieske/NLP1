Song:

So, I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
Have you seen the moon tonight, is it full?
Still burning it's embers
The people dancing in the corner
They seem happy, but I am sad
I am still dancing in the coma of the drinks I just had
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Take me to your house and I'll leave you alone
Of course I will, of course I won't
It seems so tragic, but it disappears like magic
Like magic
Like magic

Can you recommend an education or drugs
Because I'm bored with you already
I'm on Broadway and I think it's a parade
I'm covered in pieces of confetti
And I am in the twilight of my youth
Not that I'm going to remember
Dancing and slowly and finding the truth
And it covered in coma
All these people in my life, they seem so in love
Well, I am not
Memorizing my shoes in a cigarette shop
Does anybody wanna take me home?
Does anybody wanna take me home?
I'm kinda lonely, will you take me home?
Of course you will, of course you won't
Of course I'm crass, it seems so tragic
Of course you will, of course you won't
But I'll disappear, I'll disappear
Just like magic
Just like magic
Just like magic
