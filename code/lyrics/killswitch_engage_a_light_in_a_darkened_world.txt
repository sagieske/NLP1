Song:

I've seen so much corruption
And it's hard to ignore
Living on greed and possessions
Is this what were dying for

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light
In a darkened world

Many are willing
To only live for themselves
Turning away from morality
Nothing can save you now

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light
In a darkened world
You failed us all
And the water's beginning to rise
Become the light
In this darkened world

This is destiny
The choice is now defined
No more deception
Now change will come

It's in your hand's
It's in your hand's

Now choose this day
Who you will serve
To be the light
In a darkened world
It's in your hand's(it's in your hand's)
It's in your hand's(your hand's)
Become the light
In this darkened world
