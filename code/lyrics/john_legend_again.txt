Song:

The first time we ever got a chance to be alone, we knew
It was wrong to do
Guess that's why I was drawn to you
The 2nd time leads to the 3rd, the 5th, the 7th time
I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Fleeting joy and fading ecstasy
Here it goes again, oh
Sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree, the sweet taste of sin

And I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
Oh, I'm doing it again
I said it would end
But here it goes again

This time you told me you saw me at the same motel
You said you knew me well
I had that familiar smell
You asked me how am I ever gonna laern to put my trust in you
Like you want me to, 'cause I know what you're prone to do
Accusations fly like bullets do
Here it goes again, oh
You know me, because you're doing it too
It's like it never ends, never ends

Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're diong it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end
But here it goes again, and again, and again

Damn I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast, then we
We make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, the pain begins
I come back

And we're doing it again
Yes we're doing it again
Oh, we're doing it again
We said it would end
But here it goes again

Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Say that things have changed, take away the pain
And you flash back to the first time you put your spell on me
You enveloped me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here we go again, oooh
Leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, can't pretend

I keep doing it again
Oh, I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
I said it would end
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'm doing it again
I said it would end
But here it goes, again
