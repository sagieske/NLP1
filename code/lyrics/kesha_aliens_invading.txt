Song:

Don't be afraid! (

Robots found watsy (
La la la la (
Come take me higher
Take all the things that I know for sure
Come take them to slaughter

Listen to what's his face, 
I'm so sick of L.A.
Everybody's got another face(
Somebody come show me the way

Let the skys open up
Take my eyes open them up(
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid! 

(Chorus)
Aliens invading, 
Run for your life! 
Grab your wife and babies
It's going down tonight
Standing on the strip malls, 
Since dark night
We're aliens invading((aliens invading)
Are aliens invading?(run for your life! 

Signs have been written((all along us)
I swear we're sitting((alalalala)
So much we can't see
Heavenly bodies(come down and touch me

Let's take a trip to the outer space
Get me high on the milky way
I'll give you a taste
Just a little taste of the human race

Let the skies open up
Take my eyes open them up
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid! ((

(Chorus)
Aliens invading, 
Run for your life! 
Grab your wife and babies
It's going down tonight
Standing on the strip malls, 
Since dark night
We're aliens invading((aliens invading)
Are aliens invading?(run for your life! (

I am in love with an alien
You are in love with an alien
I am (I am)an alien
You are an alien
We all are (ALIENS! 
Standing on the strip malls(strip malls)(starlight
I am an alien(

(Chorus)
Aliens invading, 
Run for your life! 
Grab your wife and babies
It's going down tonight
Standing on the strip malls, 
Since dark night
We're aliens invading((aliens invading)
Are aliens invading?(aliens invading)
Are aliens invading?
Run for your life!
