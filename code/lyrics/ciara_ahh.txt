Song:

Time to break you off
And let you know
Boy you
Ride me into you
And that's for sure
When you
Put your hands on me
It turns me on
I'm not
Bout to drop my secrets
On the floor cause

[Chorus:]
Something bout the way
You make me feel I
Lose control
For you
I don't know what to do
I can't explain the way
You make me feel boy
The things I wanna do
I can't wait
Until I get you
In my room

Ahh, ahhh
I'm jus tryna be
Down wit you baby
Ahh, ahh
So many things
I wanna do
Ahh ahh
See I'm jus' trying
To be real wit you
Ahh, ahh
I jus' wanna
Rock wit you

Now it's getting
Awfully hot in here
And your
Rubbin' down my back
Whose that
Tell me
Do you hear what I hear
Sounds like someones
Trying
To get up in here

Something bout the way
You make me feel I
Lose control
For you
I don't know what to do
I can't explain the way
You make me feel boy
The things I wanna do
I can't wait
Until I get you
In my room

Ahh, ahhh
I'm jus tryna be
Down wit you baby
Ahh, ahh
So many things
I wanna do
Ahh, ahh
See I'm jus trying
To be real wit you
Ahh, ahh
I jus' wanna
Rock wit you

You gotta go
Cause if they
Catch together
Baby you know
That were doing wrong
Here they come
You better run
