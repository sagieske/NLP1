Song:

I believe in you
I've been thinking about all the things that you do
Your eyes when they stare leaves me weak
I like the way you sweep me off my feet
Now I can't speak...

I breakdown when you're not around.

I believe in dreams
I've been taking my time to see,
If we'll ever meet
Baby your eyes when they stare leaves me weak
I like the way you sweep me off my feet
Love I can't speak...

I breakdown when you're not around.
