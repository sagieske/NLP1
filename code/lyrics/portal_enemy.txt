Song:

They need change, new eyes
New colors for the promise change implies
They need relevance. Fear inspires.
A familiar face, a visage for reprise

Well he's
One man thinking, and one orating
One man ruling, and one man reigning
One man wanting, and one man taking
One man brooding with vengeful eyes

They need change, a moral intercession
Our sentinel for righteousness, arise.
They need sustenance, esteem â€“ need strength and shelter.
But with one hand to god, allegiance to disguise

You've got
One man thinking, and one orating
One man ruling, and one man reining
One man wanting, and one man taking
And one man feeding you lies

*But you won't believe in the ties that bind we two*
You're not so different from your enemy
*We're all debris, but you've fallen blind, untrue*
But your scattered faces shroud the truth
*Woefully, though we share far more than you*
And masked in overstated subtlety
*Would care to see, - you're a felon too*
The painful truth you fell into

In the pall, recesses of your sin
In the shaded corners of your soul
Beneath the shadows of our skin
Prevails the nature of us all

You need change, new lies
New colors for the promise they've devised

*But you won't believe in the ties that bind we two*
You're not so different from your enemy
*We're all debris, but you've fallen blind, untrue*
But your scattered faces shroud the truth
*Woefully, though we share far more than you*
And masked in overstated subtlety
*Would care to see, - you know it's you.*
The painful truth - you know it's you.
