Song:

I don't know just how it happened,
I let down my guard...
Swore I'd never fall in love again but I fell hard.
Guess I should have seen it coming,﻿
Caught me by suprise...
I wasnt looking where I was going,
I fell into your eyes.

You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing grace.
Before I knew what hit me baby you were flowing though my vains...

I'm addicted to you,
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Outta control,
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!

When night blows in through the window,
Dances round the room...
Got me hipnotized,
I'm getting high on the perfume.
I couldn't live without you now,
Oh, I know I'd go insane,
I wouldn't last one night alone baby,
I couldn't stand the pain!

I'm addicted to you!
Hooked on your love,
Like a powerful drug
I can't get enough of,
Lost in your eyes,
Drowning in blue
Outta control,
What can I do?
I'm﻿ addicted to you!

... I'm﻿ addicted to you!
... I'm﻿ addicted to you!
