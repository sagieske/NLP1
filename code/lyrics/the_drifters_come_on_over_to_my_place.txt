Song:

Little girl, you look so lonesome
I see you are feeling blue
Ain't no use in staying in home
I know what you should do

Come on over to my place
Hey, girl, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing
Baby, come on over tonight

Now you don't need the address
To find out where we'll be
Cause you can't help hearing the music
Halfway down the street

So, baby, come on over to my place
Come on, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing
Baby, come on over tonight

When we get tired of dancing
And things start to getting slow
That's the real best part of the evening
To turn the lights down low

So, baby, baby
Come on over to my place
Hey, girl, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing
Baby, come on over tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on over to my place
Hey, you, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing
Oh, baby, won't you come on over tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on over to my place
Hey, you, we're having a party
We'll be swinging, dancing and singing
Oh, baby, won't you come on over tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on over to my place...
