Song:

Well she wants to get in
And she wants to get out
But the city calls her name

And the scars that she hides
With those stars in her eyes
Like the echos that are all the same

Cause it's all been done before
Yes it's all been done before

And oh, you can let this one go
You can try on your own
But I want you to be here
And oh, now the signs are all quiet
And the streets are all tired
And I want you to be here

Well she's sick of this town
And the walls in this house
But her pride just won't let her see
That when she swears that she's made
With the heart that won't break
She could be dead but she'd still believe

That it's all been done before
Yes it's all been done before

And oh, you can let this one go
You can try on your own
But I want you to be here
And oh, now the signs are all quiet
And the streets are all tired
And I want you to be here

They can tell you that they want you
To stay for what you've done
They can tell you that it's alright
To be what you've become
And you go
Cause you know
It's for show

And oh, you can let this one go
You can try on your own
But I want you to be here
And oh, now the signs are all quiet
And the streets are all tired
And I want you to be here

And oh, now I tried to be quiet
But this heart is on fire
And I want you to be here

I want you to be here
I want you to be here
I want you to be here
I want you to be here
I want you to be here
