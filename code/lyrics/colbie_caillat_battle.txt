Song:

You thought we'd be fine
All these years gone by
Now your asking me to listen
Well then tell me bout everything
No lies, we're loosing time

Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, used to be happy to try!

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ooohh, Ooohh

You've got them on your side
And they won't change their minds
Now it's over
And I'm feeling like we've missed out on everything
I just hope it's worth the fight

Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
(Why'd you have to let it go?)
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
(Can't you see it hurt me so)
But why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
Things can be better, you can be happy, try!

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ooohh, Ooohh
Ooohh, Ooohh
Ooohh, Ooohh

Cause this is a battle
And it's your final last call
It was a trial, you made a mistake, we know
(Can't you see it hurt me so)
Why aren't you sorry, why aren't you sorry, why?
This can be better, we can be happy, try!

Ooohh, Ooohh
This is a battle, this is a battle
Ooohh, Ooohh
And it's you final last call
Ooohh, Ooohh
This is a battle, this is battle
Ooohh, Ooohh
And it's you final last call
Ooohh, Ooohh
This is a battle
And it's your final last call.
