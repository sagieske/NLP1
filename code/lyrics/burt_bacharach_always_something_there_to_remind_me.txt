Song:

I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me,
And every step I take recalls how much in love we used to be.
Oh, how can I forget you?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, whoa oh whoa

When shadows fall, I passed a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight
Oh, how can I forget you?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there
Oh, how can I forget you?
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you, and I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, whoa oh whoa

Never love another baby
I'll never will forget you baby
Oh you'll always be a part of me
Whoa, yessir baby
Never never never baby
