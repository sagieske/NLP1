Song:

If you need a friend to pat your little head
If you need a pal to play with you
If you need a chum to lift your spirits up
This is what a special friend will do-do-do-do-do
Well a friend never bends or pretends when a friend is in need
So depend on a friend who's a friend to his friend indeed
No a friend never bends or pretends when his friend is in need
So depend on a friend who's a friend to his friend indeed
Well sometimes you'll be down and need some boosting
Sometimes you'll be zooming way too high
I'll be there to raise you or to roost you
I'll be here to look you in the eye-yi-yi-yi-yi
Well a friend never bends or pretends when a friend is in need
So depend on a friend who's a friend to his friend indeed
No a friend never bends or pretends when his friend is in need
So depend on a friend who's a friend to his friend indeed
