Song:

I found her number and a note she wrote
Deep in a pocket of a real old coat
It just got by me someway
I must have had a real bad day

Said she was all moved in
And I promise it sure look fine
Suggested I come by and see her sometime
Said all the pictures are new
And I'll turn them all for you
She said
