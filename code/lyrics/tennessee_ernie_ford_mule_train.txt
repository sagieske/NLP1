Song:

Mule train (giddyup, pah, giddahh) *whip* (heah)...*whip*
Mule train (yeah-ha) *whip*

Clippity-cloppin' *whip* over hill and plain
Seems as how they never stop
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along

Mule train (eeh, heahy-ah) *whip... Whip*
Mule train (weuh) *whip... Whip*

Clippity-cloppin' on the mountain chain
Soon they're gonna reach the top
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along

There's a plug o' chaw tebaccer for the miner in Corona
A guitar for a cowboy way out in Arizona
A dress o' calico for the pretty Navajo
Get along mule, get along

Mule train (gidda-ah) *whip... Whip*
Mule train (yeuh) *whip*

Clippity- *whip* cloppin' through the wind and rain *whip*
A'keep 'em goin' 'til they drop
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along

There's cotton thread 'n' needles for the folks way out yonder
A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills
Get along mule, get along

Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along

Mule train (I'll skin you, aeah) *whip... Whip*
Mule train *whip... Whip*
