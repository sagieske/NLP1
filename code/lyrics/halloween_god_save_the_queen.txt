Song:

God save our gracious Queen, 
Long live our noble Queen, 
God save the Queen:
Send her victorious, 
Happy and glorious, 
Long to reign over us:
God save the Queen.

O Lord, our God, arise, 
Scatter her enemies, 
And make them fall.
Confound their politics, 
Frustrate their knavish tricks, 
On thee our hopes we fix:
God save us all.

Thy choicest gifts in store, 
On her be pleased to pour; 
Long may she reign:
May she defend our laws, 
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice
God save the Queen.

From every latent foe, 
From the assassins blow, 
God save the Queen! 
O'er her thine arm extend, 
For Britain's sake defend, 
Our mother, prince, and friend, 
God save the Queen! 

Lord grant that Marshal Wade
May by thy mighty aid
Victory bring.
May he sedition hush, 
And like a torrent rush, 
Rebellious Scots to crush.
God save the Queen!
