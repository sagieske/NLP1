Song:

Throw me in the landfill
Don't think about the consequences
Throw me in the dirt pit
Don't think about the choices that you make
Throw me in the water
Don't think about the splash I will create
Leave me at the altar
Knowing all the things you just escaped

Push me out to sea
On the little boat that you made out
Of the evergreen
That you helped your father cut away
And leave me on the tracks
To wait until the morning train arrives
Don't you dare look back
Walk away, catch up on the sunrise

This is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I hate you

So leave me in the cold
Wait until the snow covers me up
So I cannot move
So I'm just embedded in the frost
And leave me in the rain
Wait until my clothes cling to my frame
Wipe away your tear stains
Thought you said you didn't feel pain

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much
But I hate your guts

Well this is torturous
Electricity between both of us
And this is dangerous
Cause I want you so much
But I hate your guts
I want you so much
But I hate your guts
