Song:

Last seat on the bus
Who you gonna trust
Which one do you follow
Last seat on the bus
Don't make such a fuss
This much should make you hollow
'Cause every time you make yourself the reason
Is everytime you make yourself between...
Yeah

Yeah, this is a American cliche
American, American
Get on the bus
Yeah, this is a American cliche
American, American
Get on the bus

First seat on the bus
Who you gonna trust
Which one do you may follow
First seat on the bus
Don't make such a fuss
Which one do you make hollow
Now every time you make your friend the reason
And every time you make your friend beaten...yeah

Yeah, this is a American cliche
American, American
Get on the bus
Yeah, this is a American cliche
American, American
Get on the bus

You want a way to be the same
You want a way to be the same
You want a way to be the same
Oh no
