Song:

Your lips, your hips, when you touch em to mine
each and every time I'm hypnotized, I'll admit it
Your moves, your grooves It's some heavy stuff, I can't get enough
Girl your love's a drug, I can't quit it

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
from the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again

My friends, are wearing thin
They're tired of hearing your name
It ain't a healthy thing, this obsession that I'm living
So baby please, rescue me
I ain't never had nothing stuck in my head
I guess I'm having d I keep hearing

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
from the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again

Like a yo-yo-yo-yo babe is what I feel like
up and down, driving me crazy
Keep yank-yank-yanking my string-string baby baby
don't stop, don't stop

I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You've got my heart-heart skip-skip-skipping a beat
from the needle through my ahead, hit repeat
I'm a broke record, a broke record.
You're a song I gotta sing along with the men
when it gets to the end I gotta play it again and again
