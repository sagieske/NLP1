Song:

Oh oh ohhh 
Oh oh ohhh 

Life was simple, 
Roger was working round the clock to make a living, 
No computers, none of that, he used his two hands, 
Ignored the cold war
His wife would keep him warm, 
On the weekends, 
He'd load the car up with the kids and they'd go fishing, 
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession, 
Damn right he smiled a lot 
They lay awake at night 
So in love 

It was a good good year(oh oh oh)
The kids were all right, 
"Highway to Hell" beat up "Stayin' Alive",(oh oh oh)
The clash was on the radio 
And mom and dad were still in love, 
In 1979 
It was a good, good year. 

In the morning, 
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen, 
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him 
And he would hold her tight 
When they were newly weds 
He'd say maybe 
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby 
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready, 
And they would dance so slow to "Just the Way You Are". 

It was a good, good year(oh oh oh) 
The kids were all right, 
"Highway to Hell" beat up "Stayin' Alive",(oh oh oh)
The clash was on the radio 
And mom and dad were still in love, 
In 1979 
It was a good, good year. 

All the decades and the years have passed, 
Not every family is built to last, 
No time can take away these memories 
Remember when you said to me 
That we'd be all right. 

Oh oh ohhh 
The kids were all right, 
"Highway to Hell" beat up "Stayin' Alive",(oh oh oh)
The clash was on the radio 
And mom and dad were still in love, 
In 1979 
It was a good, good year. 

Oh oh ohhh 
Disco couldn't survive 
With the "Dream Police" and "Rock N Roll High" (oh oh oh) 
Blondie put out "Heart of Glass"
And mom and dad bought their first house
In 1979 
It was a good, good year.
