Song:

I bow my heart to the King that's above every king
For You O Lord can satisfy
I yield my life to the Maker of Heaven and earth
For You O Lord can satisfy
And I love You more than anything
And I need You more than anything
You can move me more than anything
Anything at all

I raise my hands to the friend
That sticks close till the end
For You O Lord can satisfy
I wrap myself in the arms of my Father again
For You O Lord can satisfy

You can move me
You can move me
You can move me
