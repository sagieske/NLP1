Song:

I used to live on cloud 9 now I moved to 8
I do serious business in surreal estate
You are on the edge but you'll have to wait
To blow out all the candles on your birthday cake
You're really gonna get your share
You're really gonna get your share

Light a friendly fire in your neighbourhood
Nobody is watching your misunderstood
If you got no good ideas then you need business plans
And if you got no grooving feet then you need helping hands
You're really gonna get your share
You're really gonna get your share

Close your ears and slowly start to count to 5
Tell your mama we're on amulation overdrive
There's no second nature, well I know you knew
Subjectivity and different points of view
You're really gonna get your share
You're really gonna get your share
I'm sure you're gonna get your share
