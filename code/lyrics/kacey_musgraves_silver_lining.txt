Song:

Woke up on the right side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies, and the well it done run dry
Light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em,
But you just ain't got 'em
Ain't we always looking for a bluer sky

If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day,
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning,
You're gonna have to stand in the rain,
Gonna have to stand in the rain

Lemonade keeps turning into lemons
You wear your heart on a ripped unraveled sleeve
Been rung through the ringer and pushed up to your limit
You say you're just unlucky, but luck ain't what you need

Cause if you're ever gonna find a four leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
Gotta get a little dirt on your hands
If you wanna find a head to fit your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
Gonna have to go to the dance

If you wanna find the honey,
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest,
You're gonna have to look past the trees, baby

Cause if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day,
It's gotta be a cloudy day
And if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning,
You're gonna have to stand in the rain,
Gonna have to stand in the rain
