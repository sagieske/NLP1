Song:

I get home & clean up, I put on my best shirt
I put on my good shoes
My arm are hard from what I do all day
And it's all for you
All for you

As I drive over by the steeple, by the hill
The rain is gone, the night is new
The constellations are coming out again
And it's all for you
All for you

It's all for you
There are songs in the world
I'm singing softly as I drive
It's all for you cause you're the only girl
And I'm young again
And it feels so good to be alive

I'll take you out
We'll find a place to eat
Somewhere small, with a view
And later on we'll go dancing if you like
And it's all for you
All for you

The old anger has given way
To clear eyes and open hands
I'm getting stronger with each new day
Cause now I understand

It's all for you
There are songs in the world
I'm singing softly as I drive
It's all for you cause you're the only girl
And I'm young again
And it feels so good to be alive

Yes it's all for you
Oh it's all for you
Oh it's all for you
It's all for you
Oh all for you
