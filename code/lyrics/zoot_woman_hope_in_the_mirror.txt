Song:

No hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says never enough

No hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says never enough

No transformation
Fears, I'm accepting
Wanting for something
Losing too much

Hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says enough

No hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says never enough

Hope in the mirror, mirror
Voice inside, inside, inside
Hope in the mirror, mirror
Voice inside, inside, inside

Hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says enough

Hope in the mirror
Breaking you up
The voice from inside
Says enough
