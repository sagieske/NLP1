Song:

All alone,
It was always there you see.
And even on my own,
It was always standing next to me.

I can see it coming from the edge of the room.
Creeping in the streetlight.
Holding my hand in the pale gloom.
Can you see it coming now?

Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down again...
Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down...

All alone,
Even when I was a child,
I've always known,
There was something to be frightened of.

And I can see it coming from the edge of the room.
Creeping in the streetlight.
Holding my hand in the pale gloom.
Can you see it coming now?

Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down again...
Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down...

All alone,
On the edge of sleep,
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me.

And I can see it coming from the edge of the room.
Smiling in the streetlight.
Even with my eyes shut tight,
I still see it coming now.

Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down again...
Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down again...
Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down again...
Aaaaaahhh...
I think I'm breaking down...
