Song:

I was lost, I am found
All the buildings are burnt to the ground
I can't stay, I can't leave
I can't do no nothing, not a thing

Do you see your son down on the street?
Is that a gun or just the father that he needs?
Do you cry, do you weep?
Do you see the world as only tragedy?

In the early mornin' there were revelations in my mind
I can hear the masters cryin' out from their graves most every night
Bring the people together
Bring the people together

It's a crime, this dark time
We wait for presidents who never turn the tide
I find it hard, I find it strange
Go to the movies, have Picasso paint your cage
I've had enough, I think I'm done
So sell me down the river, I'll be waiting there in love

In the early morning there were revelations in my mind
I can hear the masters crying out from the graves most every night
Bring the people together
Bring the people together, yeah
Bring the people together
Bring the people together, yeah

Bring the people together
For the sake of these children we leave behind
Can you remember a time, a time, a time?

I was lost, I am found
All the buildings are burnt to the ground
I can't stay, I can't leave
I can't do no nothing?, not a thing

Tell me, is this a nation? Is this a tribe?
Is this the world or just some everyday beehive?
We need it now, yeah, we need it quick
Listen to lovers, better quit it with this shit...
