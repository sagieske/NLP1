Song:

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you

Sorrow sometimes teach a lesson well
And I know that good can come from bad
So let's look into that morning star
'Cause we know just who we are

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you

Man, this road I said it's rocky rough
So much obstacles and barriers
Ecclesiastes man him say
Everything is vanity

I don't need no body
All I need is you

Sorrow sometimes teach a lesson well
And I know that good can come from bad
So let's look into that morning star
'Cause you know just who you are

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you
