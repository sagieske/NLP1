Song:

Ooohh yeahh yeah
I'm your basic average girl
And I'm here to save the world
You can't stop me
Cause I'm Kim Pos-si-ble
There is nothin I can't do
When danger calls
Just know that I am on my way

It doesn't matter where or
When there's trouble
If ya just call my name
Kim Possible

Call me, beep me if ya
Wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear
My cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything's gonna be alright
Whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me

Message clear, I am here
(Let me reassure you)
I'm never gonna leave you alone
(I am on my way)
You can always count on me
When it gets stuck I'll help you see
I will help you find your way
(Help you find your way)

It doesn't matter where or
when there's trouble
If ya just call my name

Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear
my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything's gonna be alright
Whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me

Call me, beep me if you
wanna reach me
If you wanna page me it's okay

Doesn't matter where
Doesn't matter when
I will be there for ya til the very end
Danger or trouble
I'm there on the double
You know that you always can call
Kim Possible
Yeaahh yeaah

Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear
my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything is gonna be alright
Whenever ya need me,
whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me
When ya wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear
my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything is gonna be alright
whenever you need me baby
Call me, beep me if ya
wanna reach me
