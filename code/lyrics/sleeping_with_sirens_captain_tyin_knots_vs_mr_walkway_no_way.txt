Song:

In this place I'm so afraid of, 
Bring me back to life, I swear I won't let you down! 
Just one more chance I swear it's all that I need, 
Help me to wake up! (wake up)

Is this really you?
I can't help but see no pretty things
In this dirty business that we do.
Help me believe (help me believe)
Or make me better off (make me better off), 
Help me to see, I'm better than I thought I was! 

Set me free, oh! 

There's no safety this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.
There's no saving me this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.

Set the pace, come on! 

I'm on my knees praying for something, 
Hoping for a change.
I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees, 
Won't you show me how to be?

Father, set me free, oh! 

There's no safety this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.
There's no saving me this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.


Oh it just goes to show, how fragile this heart can be, 
You'll put me back, you'll put me back, 
All these pieces, these pieces of me, oh! 

These things I'm so concerned with, they don't mean anything, 
These things I'm so concerned with, they don't mean anything, 
These things I'm so concerned with, they don't mean anything.
My heart is with you, I'll love you til the very end! 

There's no safety this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.
There's no saving me this time, I fall apart and it figures, 
It's just the way I've always been.

Yeah! 
These things I'm so afraid of, they don't mean anything, 
These things I'm so afraid of, they don't mean anything! 
They don't mean a thing!
