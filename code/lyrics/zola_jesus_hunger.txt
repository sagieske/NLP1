Song:

[Verse:]
Oh, I got the hunger
It moves but won't lose it
I'm not gettin' younger
I use it, abusively

[Chorus:]
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
It's takin' me under till it takes me away
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
I won't surrender, still it takes me away

[Verse 2:]
It's been five years waitin' around for
Crooks that will swallow gold
Sick of being seen, tired of these?
It won't save me, it won't please(?) me, no
I got a hunger, it will not let go
I got too many roads to know

[Chorus:]
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
It's takin' me under till it takes me away
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
I won't surrender, still it takes me away

[Verse 3:]
It's been too many times, I've tested myself
Waiting up on Nemo, absolute you [?]
Mother Lung, gimme a heart shake
Suffer, this maze I gotta break
It won't let up, it won't save me, no
I got a hunger that will not let go
I got too many roads to know

[Chorus:]
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
It's takin' me under till it takes me away
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
I won't surrender, still it takes me away

[Bridge:]
(Takes me away)
(Takes me away)
(Takes me away)
There is something I want
I long for, I need
There is something I want
I long for, I need

[Chorus:]
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
It's takin' me under till it takes me away
I got the hunger, I got the hunger in my veins
I won't surrender, still it takes me away
