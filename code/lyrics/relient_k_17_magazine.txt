Song:

Talked to my sister late last night.
And she gave me some advice.
And what she said was right.
Talked to my sister late last night.
I said I've got her on my mind.
She said that's good I know my kind.

And maybe this time,
Maybe she's just the one you need.
Keep taking your time,
You shouldn't go for her full speed.

Cause I know that I've never seen
Your motives so squeaky clean,
And my 17 Magazine tells me
That you're in love.

Jessica told me that I should take a quiz.
10 yes or no questions to tell me what love really is.
I searched for my answers,
I lied and said I like N*Sync.
They said my middle name's Don Juan,
And I'm sure of myself
I think

Cause if you're asking me,
Love is sacred love is sweet,
and my 17 Magazine tells me
That you're in love.
