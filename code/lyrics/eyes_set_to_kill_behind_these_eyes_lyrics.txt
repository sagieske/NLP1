Song:

Colour the dark past
(With brighter imagery)
Fill blank lines with white lies
Stop to think, then cover up my memories. (My memories)
Fill blank lines with white lies
Stop to think, then cover up.

It's the distance we need (to erase and to start clean)
It's the distance we need (to forget)
These miles give me the time to think of the differences we make.
With you I'll always be missing.
(The pieces of me you break.)
Now that I hear my heart clearly.
(The words I couldn't say)
Speak through my heart now that I've changed.
(You can see, you can see)
All the lies that hide my
(You could see inside)
All the lies hide behind my eyes.

Bring back night to day (feel my heartbeat)
To erase the pain (of my memories)
(When the sunset fades, the moonlight tears my body
'Til morning rays bring me to a better place.)

It's the distance we need
It's the distance we need (to forget)
These miles give me the time to think of the differences we make.
With you I'll always be missing.
(The pieces of me you break.)
Now that I hear my heart clearly.
(The words I couldn't say)
Speak through my heart now that I've changed.
(You can see, you can see)
All the lies that hide my
(You could see inside)
All the lies hide behind my eyes.

(Let it go, pull the weight off my shoulders
Lets hope for a new beginning.
Let it go, pull the weight off my shoulders
Lets hope for a new beginning.
We'll set our feelings aside and forget what we've said
There's not enough time to hide behind these eyes of regret.)
