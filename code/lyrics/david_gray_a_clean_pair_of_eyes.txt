Song:

Hear me God I'm on the level
Mapping silence seeing things
Crying laughing like the devil

And before the might
Of all that's seen
I'll raise my head
And wake to dream
With a clean pair of eyes

Murdered gold and colours flashing
Time like blood like flowing hair
Faces merging airplanes crashing

And before the might
Of all that's true
I'll raise my head
And dream anew
With a clean pair of eyes

A clean pair of eyes
Don't need no one to blame
Don't need no disguise
No sugar to sweet my brain
A clean pair of eyes

Today I need no commentary
Today I do not need to speak
No explanation necessary

And before the might
Of al that's seen
I'll raise my head
And dream again
With a clean pair of eyes

A clean pair of eyes
Don't need no right or wrong
Don't need no disguise
No sugar to fix my tongue
A clean pair of eyes

Liquid air and flags that ripple
A tambourine of smoke suns
Love that blinds up fear that cripples

And before the might
Of all that's seen
I'll raise my head
And wake to dream
And before the might
Of all that's true
I'll raise my head
And dream anew
And before the might
Of all unnamed
I'll raise my head
And dream again
Dream again
Dream again
Dream again
Dream again
