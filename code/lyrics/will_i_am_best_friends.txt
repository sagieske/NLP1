Song:

Ain't nothing in the world that can
Tear it apart, you my friend
Ain't nothing in the universe
That can come in between us, 
If you're in a rut
I will pick you up and bring you back
To who you are

Anything that you need
I'm here for ya
Where ever I need to be
I'm there for ya
Unconditional even if it ain't cool
I'm there when you need me
You need a shoulder to cry on?
It's here for ya
Need a friend to rely on
I'm there for ya
Unconditional
I know you know you're my buddy
And you my bestest friend

Nobody better say nothing bad about
My friend
Ain't no kinda gossip you can spread around
That will change my opinion
They can make it up they can talk that trash
You know who I am and I know who you are

Anything that you need
I'm here for ya
Where ever I need to be
I'm there for ya
Unconditional even if it ain't cool
I'm there when you need me
If you need a laugh I'm there for you
If you need a place to crash
Come on
Unconditional
I know you know you're my buddy
And you my bestest friend

Yeah you my bestest friend
I know you know you're my bestest friend
