Song:

There are nights when i cant help but cry
And i wonder why you have to leave me

Why did it have to end so soon
When you said that you would never leave me

Chorus
Tell me
Where did i go wrong?
What did i do to make you change your mind completely
When i thought
This love would never end
But if this love's not ours to have
I'll let it go
With your goodbye

Why did it have to end so soon
When you said that you would never leave me
Tell me
Where did i go wrong?
What did i do to make you change your mind completely?
When i thought
This love would never end
But if this love's not ours to have
I'll let it go
With your goodbye...
