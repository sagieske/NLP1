Song:

We are back in our minds, again
(x3)
We don't fight no more
We done close that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brother
Livin' in this world we all live in
We are back in our minds, again
(x3)
We don't fight no more (we don't fight, y'all)
We don't close that door
This time for sure (we don't fight, y'all)
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're souls to your brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in
Back in our minds again
