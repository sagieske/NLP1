Song:

Baby don't be shy
When you're holding my hand
'Cause this time goes back
You got to understand it's you

Ba ba ba baby in your eyes
I see it so clearly that our love it's so strong
And you never go wrong
I got the best for you so I'm waiting down
If you need someone
Baby call my line
Call me anytime
I'll be there for you you you
I've been searching high high high
I've been searching low low low

Chorus
Ba ba ba ba baby
Don't forget my number
Ba ba ba ba baby
Love is stronger than thunder
Ba ba ba ba baby
Don't forget my number
Love will see you through

I've been searching high
I've been searching low
Want to spend spend my life with you
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Can I dance with you
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Love will see you through

Ba ba ba baby in your eyes
I see it so clearly that our love it's so strong
And you never go wrong
I got the best for you so I'm waiting down
If you need someone
Baby call my line
Call me anytime
I'll be there for you you you
I've been searching high high high
I've been searching low low low

[Chorus:]
Ba ba ba ba baby
Don't forget my number
Ba ba ba ba baby
Love is stronger than thunder
Ba ba ba ba baby
Don't forget my number
Love will see you through

I've been searching high
I've been searching low
Want to spend spend my life with you
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Can I dance with you
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Love will see you through
