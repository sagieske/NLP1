Song:

I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference

Little boy caught in a drive-by
Witnessed the killer who made his daddy die,
And 'cause he identified and signed the dotted line
He could feel it in his stomach, he signed away his life
Little boy who once was the lader of his class
The little source of joy, always neatly dressed
Now would hang his head, and be left crying at his desk
Was found with his mother, lying in her lap
With two bullets in his chest

And, on my god, what is this madness?
I will not let it kill my gladness
And, oh my god what is this madness?
My joy inside will send this message

I want to be somebody
I wnat to make a difference
For we are all children of the Mother
I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference
For we are all children of the Father

Outspoken man, leading sisters and brothers
Picked himself up from husting, drugs and gutters
Doing time on the inside, he found a higher power
Now, back with a mission to help us help each other

Respected from bourgeoisie to homeless in the street
From universities, Africa, the Middle East
And through the treats of death he spoke truth and set men free
But the power of the truth made enemies of the weak
He was killed by his own people

And, on my god, what is this madness?
I will not let it kill my gladness
And, oh my god what is this madness?
My joy inside will send this message

I want to be somebody
I wnat to make a difference
For we are all children of the Mother
I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference
For we are all children

Ignite This Fire inside, this light that is the Truth
Shake off the system's chains, no longer be their fool
In the face of brutality, show the other cheek
Trigger-happy policing will never kill our dignity

And, on my god, what is this madness?
I will not let it kill my gladness
And, oh my god what is this madness?
My joy inside will send this message

Lift up your heart and See
Open your heart and See
Lift up your voice and Sing...

I want to be somebody
I wnat to make a difference
For we are all children of the Mother
I want to be somebody
I want to make a difference
For we are all children of the Father
