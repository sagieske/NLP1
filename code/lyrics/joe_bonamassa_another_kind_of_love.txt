Song:

Poor little baby
You've got your lover, she's a girl
Poor little baby
You've got caught up in the world

I've got to say you lost your way
You're a woman, another kind of woman
Another kind of love

You just pile on your misery
Now you have failed
But deep down inside yourself
See if you can tell

Poor little baby
You've got caught up in the world
I got to say you've lost your way
You're a woman, another kind of woman
Another kind of love, hey yeah

I can show you a brand new world
Now you'll never be satisfied
When there's nowhere to run, baby
There's nowhere to hide

Poor little baby
You've got caught up in the world
I've got to say you've lost your way
You're a woman, another kind of woman
Another kind of love
