Song:

Am I sleeping forever
Am I drowning in fear
Are my sins unforgiven
Will you still let me in

I was crucified
Buried down alive
Wasted all my time

Where is the road
And what's the time
Everything is gone in my own eyes
I'm lost in the dark

I wish I'm not the same old me
Will you still remember me
I'm lost in your heart

Is this place getting colder
And there's nobody here
Are my days are really over
Give me sign make it clear

I was crucified
Buried down alive
Wasted all my time

Where is the road
And what's the time
Everything is gone in my own eyes

I'm lost in the dark
I wish I'm not the same old me
Will you still remember me
I'm lost in your heart

I'm running away from delusions
I'm living my life way too fast
What surrounds me are illusions
It tears me apart
Lost in the darkest hour

Where is the road
And what's the time
Everything is gone in my own eyes
I'm lost in the dark

I wish I'm not the same old me
Will you still remember me
I'm lost in your heart
