Song:

How could you be everything?
We were crackin' you up to be.
We're cracking ourselves up.. Too...
We're cracking ourselves up to be you.

Had you in my hand now where'd you go, Aurora?
See you up ahead, but I don't know if I could go as far as you go.

Everything keeps on happening, and it's happening to me.
I'm losing side of it's meaning.
You blew away the meaning.

Had it in my head, but where'd it go, Aurora?
See you up ahead, but I don't know if I could go as far as you go.

And everyone keeps telling me that this is good.
I needed you to tell me it was is good too.

Had you in my head, but where'd you go, Aurora?
I See you up ahead, but I don't know if I could go as far as you go.
