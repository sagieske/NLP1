Song:

Oh, it's cryin' time again, 
You're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin' Oooh
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence makes
The heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never be no stronger
(Stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now

That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you've found someone
That you love better (better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow ('morrow)
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'.
Alright now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
(That it won't be long before it's cryin' time)
