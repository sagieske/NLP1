Song:

There's a place at the edge of the sky
Where there's a love deep as it is wide
The weak are strong, hungry are all fed
And there's a breeze from the angels flyin' overhead

Ah, yeah
There's a path, a glorious light
That guides you up the mountainside
At the top, if you could you'd cry
'Cause you see pure love for the very first time
Deep as it is wide

Chorus:
Every breath takin' me closer
Every step leadin' to paradise
They say, the faithful get to go there
I believe there's a love deep as it is wide

I hear when you get to the river
You look back for the very last time
And when you cross, you get washed off forever
Hurry up boy, eternity is on the other side
Whoa, deep as it is wide, yeah

Repeat Chorus

Every nation, color and creed
Like grace pouring out, far as the eye can see
Singin' praises up to a King 'cause He died
For a crowd, deep as it is wide, yeah, yeah, yeah

Repeat Chorus

I believe in love, oh yeah
I believe there's a love deep as it is wide
Oh, yeah, oh, oh

There's a place at the edge of the sky
There's a love deep as it is wide
