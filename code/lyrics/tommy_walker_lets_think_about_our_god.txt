Song:

Let's think about our God
Our Savior and our King
The One who gave it all
He gave up everything
Let's think about the Man
Who she'd His precious blood
So we could be His friends
His friends until the end

And give our love and praise to Him
He is our Savior and our friend
Let's give our love and praise to Him
He is our Savior and our friend

Let's think about our Father's heart
So right and true
He's never given up
Given up on me or you
Let's think about our God
Of love and mercy free
He's washed us white as snow
For all eternity

We love You Lord
We love You Lord
Just one thought of You
And all we can say is

Let's think about our God
The high and lofty One
Who says He's never far
From the brokenhearted ones
Let's think about our Lord
Who formed the stars above
So we could have a glimpse
Of His glory up above
