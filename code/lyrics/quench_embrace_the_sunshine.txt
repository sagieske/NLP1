Song:

Do you ever feel the cold at night
All only to feel it's warmth inside
Sick and war-ar-arm beneath the healing li-i-ight
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshine, e-e-embra-ace
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshi-ine, e-e-embra-a-ace
I woke up late today without warmth all over me
As the sunshine reaches out, breaks through the trees
Leafy shadows crawl across my bedroom walls
I could feel the bree-ee-eeze
When I'm feeling down and all messed up within
I just remember the sun's warmth pulls me throu-ou-ough
I get outside and soak it up with my blue eyes
You can feel it too-oo-oo
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshine, e-e-embra-ace
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshi-ine, e-e-embra-a-ace
E-e-embrace the sunshine, e-e-embra-ace
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshi-ine, e-e-embra-a-ace
I feel the strength, I feel the peace and harmony
Away from everything I learnt tranquility
All it has to give I take with open arms
Feel that sunbaked breeze
I want the feeling like the one I feel right now
I tried to know where, I'll find my space somehow
I need to get away, leave the night behind
I will find my way-ay-ay-ay-ay
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshine, e-e-embra-ace
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshi-ine, e-e-embra-a-ace
E-e-embrace the sunshine, e-e-embra-ace
You got to e-e-embrace the sunshi-ine, e-e-embra-a-ace
Can you feel the warmth withi-i-i-i-i-in
Can you feel the warmth withi-i-i-i-i-in
