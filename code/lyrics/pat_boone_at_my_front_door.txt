Song:

Crazy little mama come knocking, knocking at my front door door door
Crazy little mama come knocking, knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
Woke up this morning with a feeling of despair lookin for my baby and she wasn't there
Heard someone knocking and much to my surprise
There stood my baby looking in my eyes
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
If you got a little mama and ya want to keep her neat
Keep your little mama off my street
Same thing will happen like it did before
She'll come knock, knock, knocking atmy door
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
If you got a little mama and ya want to keep her neat
Keep your little mama off my street
Same thing will happen like it did before
She'll come knock, knock, knocking atmy door
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
Crazy little mama come knocking, knocking at my front door door door
Crazy little mama come knocking, knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
Music interlude
If you got a little mama and ya want to keep her neat
Keep your little mama off my street
Same thing will happen like it did before
She'll come knock, knock, knocking atmy door
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
Yi yi yi yi yi yi
Crazy little mama come knock, knock, knocking, just like she did before
Oh oh oh oh oooooooooo
Music to end
