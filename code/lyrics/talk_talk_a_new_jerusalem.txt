Song:

And I'm home again
But alone my child
For the emptiness of war remains
One among five
But I'm dead to love
A pawn the same

And I'm home again
Run along my child
For the water's blood
And so the sea

Summer unwinds
But no longer kind

Heaven burn me
Should I swear to fight once more

D'you see
Wise words
Wild words
