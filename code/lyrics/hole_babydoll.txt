Song:

Here you come sucking my energy
And you suck it up right off the street
Ha.. Babydoll
Here you are sucking my energy and I
Drill it in my good hole so that I can see
You are you are so much bigger than me
You are you are so much bigger than me
And a... Babydoll
My raw hand my fever blister
Watch me watch me watch me disappear

Here she comes
Her pants undone
All waste and void all waste and void
Her void... And her void wow
There you go in your nazi car
Oh my babydoll how a w***e you are
And your sit around with your old rag
How can I how can I talk when you've got the gag and I
Here you come sucking my energy
And you suck it up baby right off the street and I
Babydoll

In the dark yah I destroy what I began what I destroy it
She's hanging in the blossom tree oh
Babydoll just bleeds for me
Babydoll
Touch her oh I feel
Her chemical wedding her chemical peel
I knife me and
I slash my and
I knife me and
Then I slash my my my my my
Sickened suddenly
Here you are as ugly as me
Drill it in my good holes o that I can see
Yah drill it in my good hole so that I can see yah

Here you come sucking my energy
You suck it up baby right off the street
Babydoll
She starts too stare the sun
Into the sun
Now I I want a cancer
That the crooked eye spun

Well you oh my and my energy
Cause baby you are so much so much bigger than me
Babydoll
Little girl she's on the floor she gets it all
Cause she's the w***e
Little girl she's on the ground she gets it all
For falling falling down falling down and what a down
What a whiner wow
Help help she says I am not free
She says help me I am withering withering
Withering with a ring
Hang on soul it's a soul comes down
See see it's a soul
