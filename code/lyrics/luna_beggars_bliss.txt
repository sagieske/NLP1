Song:

Woman made of paper, understand me now
This time they got you by the ears
You might be nothin' or just a footprint
They've been watchin' you for years

It's a strange fascination
It's a bliss
It's a beggar's bliss

A double dance for twenty dollars
You may be crooked but not cheap
Go ahead and make a mistake
That's what you're made of
They've been watchin' you for years

It's a strange fascination
It's a bliss
It's a beggar's bliss

In the shadow of a candlestick your face appears
Quickly, now is the time, why are we waitin'?
Uptown, downtown I could care less
I've been watchin' you for years

It's a strange fascination
It's a bliss
It's a beggar's bliss
