Song:

This feeling that I'm feeling
Making me want to give up
How I used to be
True player all the way
Till I met her
Switched my game in a heartbeat
Cause she's everything
Always said I would
Never fall I love
She really got me
Floating on cloud nine
Chorus
I wouldn't give her up
For nothing in the world
I don't want no body she's all I need
Chillin with the fellas
But I'm in another world reminiscing
About everything that she does
In my heart there's no other
Cause she's everything
Always said I would
Never fall in love
She really got me
Floating on cloud nine
Girl it's almost like dreams cause I never
Ever thought that nobody could change me
She came and changed my world
Can't shake this feeling that you're givin me
Its almost like someone put a spell on me
She came and changed my world
