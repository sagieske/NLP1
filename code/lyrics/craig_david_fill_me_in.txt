Song:

(All right)
(Come on)
(Can you fill me in)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor

So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Ja'causezi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone

I mean me and her
Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Ja'causezi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Check in where nobody saw

The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it coz you felt cold

I mean me and her
I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

(Can you fill me in)

All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby

(Craig David)

Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby

Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in

(Can you fill me in)

Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Ja'causezi turned on
Can you fill me in

(Can you fill me in)..
