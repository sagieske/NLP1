Song:

I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Trying to make myself a sail
Then I'll float to you my darlin'
With the evening on my tail
Although not the most honest means of travel
It gets me there nonetheless
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
And a helpless one at best

Darling I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy
Before I go
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
And lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy
After my heart

Oh, and I'm often fals explaining
But to her it plays out all the same
And although I'm left defeated
It get's held against my name
I know you got plenty to offer baby
But I guess I've taken quite enough
Well I'm some stain there on your bedsheet
You're my diamond in the rough

Darling I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy
Before I go
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
And lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy
After my heart
I know that there're writtings on the wall
But Darling I'll bathe your skin
I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy
After my heart

Oh, and I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, then I'll be there waiting for you
I'll be there waiting for you
Oh, then I'll be there waiting on you
I'll be there waiting for you
I'll be there waiting for you
