Song:

Lover:
Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year,
Especially if you and me
See it in together.

Father:
So you think '21
Is going to be a good year?
It could be good for me and her,
But you and her - no, never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic,
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather...

Mother:
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!

Mother & Father:
You didn't hear it.

You didn't see it.
You won't say nothing to no-one
Ever in your life.
You never heard it.
Oh, how absurd it all seems
Without any proof.
You didn't hear it.
You didn't see it.
You never heard it - not a word of it!
You won't say nothing to no-one,
Never tell a soul
What you know is the Truth.

Father:

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year,
Especially if you and me
See it in together.
Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year,
Especially if you and me
See it in together.
I had no reason to be over-optimistic,
But somehow, when you smiled, I could brave bad weather...

Mother:

What about the boy?...
