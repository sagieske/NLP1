Song:

Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still and know that I am here
Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still, be still and know

When darkness comes upon you
And covers you with fear and shame
Be still and know that I'm with you
And I will say your name

If terror falls upon your bed
And Sleep no longer comes
Remember all the words I said
Be still, be still and know

And when you go through the valley
And the shadow comes down from the hill
If morning never comes to be
Be still, be still, be still

If you forget the way to go
And lose where you came from
If no one is standing beside you
Be still and know I am

Be still and know that I'm with you
Be still and know I am
