Song:

All the way across the world
You went to find the sunshine in your soul.
Did you find what you were lookin' for?
Did the world show its face to you?

All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.

So many times you told me you were leavin'
To try and find a place where you could go.
Did you find what you were lookin' for?
Did the world show its face to you?

All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.

All the way across the world
You went to find the sunshine in your soul.
Though I missed you so badly,
I was so glad to see you again.

All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.

All the way across the world
You went to find the sunshine in your soul.
Did you find what you were lookin' for?
Did the world show its face to you?

All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.

All the way from Africa.
All the way from Africa.
E-oh
