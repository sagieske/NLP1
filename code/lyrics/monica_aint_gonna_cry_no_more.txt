Song:

Mmm... Beeen a long time
Yea... Yea... Yea
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Can I talk to you for a minute

Verse 1:

Inseparable that's how we were
Through anything you were my world
I gave you, you shared with me
For the love of you I give anything
I would chill wit you, you and your crew
And if I complain bout the things you do
But I see it now, how it all went down
I can't take no more don't want you around
Never told me the whole truth
Never reaching back I knew
You refused how could you do this to me?
Through the hurt so now I see
That you came for you and me it can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

Chorus:

Cause I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Because you don't deserve me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm tired of you, me, and she

Verse 2:

And now I can't believe all the things you did
All your secret trips just to see your kids
What about the crib that I never been
Cause that's the one that she lives in
But soon you see cause the man is not
In your love affair was gonna be forgot
And you will miss me but I won't miss you
You can pull the key cause now we're through
Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew but we're through
You didn't have to do what you did to me
You want her so now I see plans
We made for you and me they can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

Chorus:

I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm sick of you hurting me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Because you don't deserve me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
And don't forget to leave my key
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm tired of you, me, and she

Verse 3:

Used to think that you and me were in love
For sure but I was wrong cause you led me on
But now I found I'm cool without you around
You gotta bounce, I'm tired

Chorus:

I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm sick of you hurting me
It's not the fact that it's your baby
I ain't gonna cry no more
But it's the fact that you lied
Because you don't deserve me
And it hurt me
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
Cause you don't mean me no good
I ain't gonna cry no more
Cause I'm tired of you, me, and she

Repeat chorus 1x

Bridge:

I'm sick of you
I'm through with you
I'm done with you
I'm tired of your lies

Repeat chorus 1x
