Song:

Between the forest and the ocean lies a lonely strand
The ocean is your mother the forest father land
You are stranded on that empty beach
Not knowing where to go, out to sea or else in land
Your whole life you don't know

In between the earth and sky, there is an atmosphere
Feet on the ground your head up high
But you are stuck right here
You're in between your whole life long
What happens when you die
Down below is mother earth,
Your father dwells on high

Honor thy father and thy mother
Though they're not the same
And one pits you against the other
It's the cruelest game
You are stuck and you are stranded
You must live until you die
At home, & forest & in ocean, worship earth & sky
At home, &forest & in ocean, worship earth & sky
