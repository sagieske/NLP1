Song:

Remember when you left
Yeah, you had your rules
About playin' the game
And any day, you could walk away
Feelin' no pain

Now look at yourself
Yeah, you're all hung up
On somebody else
And in your eyes
I see all the signs
Of the misery
That you laid on me

Baby, baby, didn't you know
You'd have to cry sometime
Oh, didn't you know
Didn't you know
You'd have to hurt sometime
Didn't you know
You'd have to lose your pride
Didn't anybody tell you
Love had another side

Oh, you used to be so proud
Now your head's a little lower
And you walk a little slower
And you don't talk so loud

Hmm, now, you've gotten wise
Yeah, you know how love can
Build you up one moment
And the next
Cut you down to size
And then you discover
All she told you
Was a bunch of lies

Didn't you know
You'd have to cry sometime
Oh, baby, didn't you know
Didn't you know
You'd have to hurt sometime
Didn't you know
You'd have to lose your pride
Didn't anybody tell you
Love had another side

Whoa, oh, whoa
Now, you come to me
Yeah, you hurt so bad
You wanna feel the security
Of a love you once had
Oh, but I can't open doors
And my arms can't ever
Take the place of her
'Cause no other could ever
Take the place of yours
So what can I tell you

Baby, didn't you know
You'd have to cry sometime
Didn't you know
You'd have to hurt sometime

Oh, didn't you know
Didn't you know
You'd have to cry sometime
Didn't you know
Think about it
You have to cry sometime
