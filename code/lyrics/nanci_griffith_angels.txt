Song:

The touch of your hand will let me know
You'll take me in then let me go
If not for love why would we meet?
How is it turned two into one so easily?

We're lifted up by Angels

You understand, and you never say
How every plan could fade away
If not for love where would you be?
Ashes to dust, water to rust, away from me

[Chorus:]
We're lifted up by Angels
Higher than the world
Strong enough to leave it
Bound to learn the secret
Angels never hurt
Close enough to heaven
Above the rain
Darkness cannot reach us
Let the Angels teach us
Only love remains

We're lifted up by Angels

Given wings to fly
Leave the night behind us
Trust the light to find us
Even as we rise

We're lifted up by Angels

[Chorus:]
