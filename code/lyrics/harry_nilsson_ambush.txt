Song:

The lamp that lights the way
Is a light from yesterday.
The drum which leads the way
Is a sound from yesterday.

The road is filled with shadows
Of a million, living leaves.
Darkness all around us
And not a friend in sight.

We sang a song together
To help us through the night.
The song was sung with spirit
But soft, and like a choir.

And as the others sang along,
Our voices lifted higher.
We sang until we reached the bridge
We crossed, then saw the wire.

But by the time we stopped the song,
The enemy had opened fire.

Now, we ain't gonna sing that song no more
Ain't gonna sing that song no more.
Just don't pay to sing no more
Especially when you're in a war. A war.

Now, this time through,
We want everybody to listen to the punchline
All right. All right. All right! All right!

The song was sung with spirit
But soft and like a choir.
But by the time we stopped the song,
The enemy had opened fire.

Now, we ain't gonna sing that song no more.
Ain't gonna sing that song no more.
Just don't pay to sing no more.
Especially when you're in a war.
