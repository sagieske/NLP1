Song:

Going down tonight, it's going down tonight
It's going down tonight, it's going down

Baby, I love the way you're lookin' at me, lookin' at me
You're so amazin', you gotta give it to me, give it to me
You touched every single part of me, I'll touch every single part of you
I'm gonna make sure that your gonna wanna come back for more

Baby, I can tell you're feelin' me, feelin' me
Your body's callin', what's your fantasy, fantasy?
You touched every single part of me, I'll touch every single part of you
Hey girl, stop playin' games and meet me at the door

Do you wanna get down? Do you wanna get down tonight?
You can bring your home girl if you like, don't be scared girl, I won't bite
'Cause I'm gonna bring it out of you, all the freaky things inside of you
It's going down tonight, I said it's going down tonight
Yes, yes, it's going down tonight

Girl, when we meet here we're gonna go, we're gonna go
Takin' you to places you never been before, been before
I'll do freaky things you like, you'll do freaky things I like
I'm gonna make sure that you are gonna wanna come back for more

Let's try to keep this between me and you, me and you
No need to tell unless you want me to, want me to
We'll do freaky things tonight, we'll do freaky things I like
So girl, stop playin' games and meet me at the door

Do you wanna get down? You can bring your home girl if you like
Don't be scared girl, I won't bite 'cause I'm gonna bring it out of you
All the freaky things inside of you, it's going down tonight
I said it's going down tonight, yes, yes, it's going down tonight

Hey yo, shakin' that body like it's J. Lo
Shawty 'bout to make 112 loose control
We all up in the club like hey yo
Work it like a stripper like ooo wooahh

Come and take a sip of that oo wooahh
She's all over me like oo wooahh
In the vip I'm like do it baby
Shake it baby, drop it baby, shake it baby

Pimp to the T in the vip
Everybody drinkin' in the bar with me
I spot a group of ladies with they eyes on me
And I ain't gotta pick one, I can have all three

Like what's that the latest I have seen you choosin'
Can help but thinkin' of you three and nude and
Skip the game, cut that out of confusion
I'm tired of talkin' over all this refusin'

If this goes to well, we all can loose it
Make 'em an offer and they couldn't refuse it
Got in the two door, started cruisin'
We blew threw when they started removin'

And while I drove, they topless now
Two of those, it's poppin' now
Touch here, kiss there, no stoppin' now
She licked there and got her underwear droppin' down

Do you wanna get down? You can bring your home girl if you like
Don't be scared girl, I won't bite 'cause I'm gonna bring it out of you
All the freaky things inside of you, it's going down tonight
I said it's going down tonight, yes, yes, it's going down tonight

Do you wanna get down? You can bring your home girl if you like
Don't be scared girl, I won't bite 'cause I'm gonna bring it out of you
All the freaky things inside of you, it's going down tonight
I said it's going down tonight, yes, yes, it's going down tonight

It's going down tonight, it's going down tonight
It's going down tonight, it's going down tonight
