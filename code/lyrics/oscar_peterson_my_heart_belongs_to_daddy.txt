Song:

I used to fall in love with all those boys
Who maul the young cuties
But now I find I’m more inclined
To keep my mind on my duties

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don’t follow through
‘Cause my heart belongs to daddy

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine Finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
But my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn’t be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you’re perfectly swell
But my heart belongs to daddy
‘Cause my daddy he treats it so well

There was a dame at a football game
Made long for the strong undergraddie
I never dream of making the team
‘Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn’t be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

So I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know you’re perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
‘Cause my daddy he treats it so well
