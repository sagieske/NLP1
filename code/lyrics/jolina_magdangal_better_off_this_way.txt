Song:

It's better off this way, (hey hey)
Would hate to ever see you
Walk away,
Uh-huh...

I like what we have the way it is
So why you gettin' serious
I know what you like
I'm not that cutesy type
Don't want to ruin what we have
By throwin' love into this
So I'll pretend that you did'nt say
What you said, (yeah)

What's gettin' into you
Why you in this crazy mood
We've been friends through
Everything, why change?

It's better off this way, (hey hey)
Would hate to ever see you
Walk away
Cause of a mistake
That one of us would make
Trust me when I say
It's better off this way,
Yeah, It's better off this way,
Lalalala...
Yeah, It's better off this way,

I know all the lines that you've used
On all the girls you've been through
I know all the tricks not to quick
To fall for this
Tommorow you'll be in love again
You know you will so don't pretend
But I'll be here and we could still
Be best of friends

What's gettin' into you
Why you in this crazy mood
We've been friends through
Everything, why change?

It's better off this way, (hey hey)
Would hate to ever see you
Walk away
Cause of a mistake
That one of us would make
Trust me when I say
It's better off this way,
Yeah, It's better off this way,

Sometimes I look at you
Secretly I feel It too
Kinda strange to think of us
Together in that way
And when you're there for me
Think that maybe we could be
More than friends
But why take that chance

It's better off this way, (hey hey)
Would hate to ever see you
Walk away
Cause of a mistake
That one of us would make
Trust me when I say
Yeah! it's better off this way...
Lalalala...
Better off this way...
