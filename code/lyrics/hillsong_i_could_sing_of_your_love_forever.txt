Song:

[Intro:]
Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing of
Of when Your love came down

[Chorus:]
I could sing of Your love forever (x4)

[Bridge:]
Oh I feel like dancing
It's foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy
Like they're dancing now

I could sing of your love forever (5x)
