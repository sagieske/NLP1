Song:

[Verse:]
Well, I'm turning in voices, I don't want them no' more
Took off, my baby, I'll be useless in the morning
My heart is all in tatters, I ain't nobody sane
Just trying not to call you, t-t-trying not to call you

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I learned the rules, out with the wolves
I'm vicious now honey, cool and unprincipled
With tears in my eyeballs, wine on my lips
Aha

[Chorus:]
All my love, my love is a plague
Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?
Of all the winds and weeds(?), just the same
I can't feel the pain! Ain't that a shame?

[Verse:]
Now somebody hit the lights, get some ropes and medicines
And think about the shoot-up and how it's gonna end
Last night I was freezin', tonight I'm soaking wet
Well, I must have had a fever, salivating in my bed

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I learned the rules, out with the wolves
I'm vicious now honey, dumb and insatiable
With tears in my eyeballs, your name on my lips
Aha

[Chorus:]
All my love, my love is a plague
Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?
Of all the winds and weeds(?), just the same
I can't feel the pain! Ain't that a shame?

[Bridge:]
Oh, my love, she's a plague, ain't that a shame?
And you know you're gonna wait so long
Time slips away till you can't feel the kick
My, how it tames, I stood out on that phone
And waited in vain, blew back my baby

[Chorus:]
All my love, my love is a plague
Ain't that a shame? Ain't that a shame?
Of all the winds and weeds(?), just the same
I can't feel the pain! Ain't that a shame?
