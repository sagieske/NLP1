Song:

Now honey
You do the the dishes and I'll feed the ol' sow
Also the chickens and our one Jersey cow
Take down your curlers and powder your nose
Big time at Jones' Place so wear your best clothes

There'll be no evening gowns, not even a tux
They'll come in wagons, buggies and pickup trucks
We'll do square dancing under kerosene lights
We'll wear our glad rags tonight, my honey
We'll wear our glad rags tonight

Big time at Jones' Place so wear your best clothes

Sylvester Cunningham will fiddle a tune
Red headed kids will swipe away his spittoon
Then run and hide behind a bale of hay
But that old sittin' hen will scare them away

Look for me beside the old cider keg
I'll set my cup down and we'll both shake a leg
Never a ballroom had a prettier sight
We'll wear our glad rags tonight, my honey
We'll wear our glad rags tonight
