Song:

Dangerous feelings break out my soul
It's just the meaning of being alone
I need you here wherever you are
I need you now to take me so far
I wanna run like the speed of the sound
I was somewhere, I'm sure you're around
You give me now the meaning of life

With you I'm feeling alive
Ooooooo...

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing
Ooooooo...
Aaahhh...

Go!

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing

Why you're looking like that
I'm burning like fire
I wanna be higher
Just let me know
Why you're looking like that
You're driving me crazy
You're looking amazing
