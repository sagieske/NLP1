Song:

The sun is shining hard at my feet
And the city is an animal ready to eat

It's raining like a nose bleed, cigarettes and sweets
And I feel it coming on
Bloody as the day I was born

It's 1974
Just like the day I was born
It's 1974

She isn't crazy
She's just not impressed
She stabs me with her eyes
Dirty knives hidden in her dress

And it's raining like bombs in my room when I'm alone
And I swear I think I knew you before
Just like the day I was born

It's 1974
Just like the day I was born
It's 1974
Just like the day I was born
It's 1974
Just like the day I was born
It's 1974

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it, come on
Do you want it, do you want it, come on just bring it on
Nothing gonna stop it now
But nothing
Do you want it, come on
Do you want it, do you want it, come on just bring it on

It's 1974
It's 1974
It's 1974
It's 1974
