Song:

Saying goodbye wasn't easy to do
After all that we've been through
I can't get by with all this things in my head
I'm trying to understand

Refrain:
In my heart
Beating over and over
For your love
Is the one thing that I can't let go

Chorus:
Do you really wanna know
What my love is holding on
After all this time That you I'm thinking of
Did I ever crossed your mind
That I can even crossed the line
For this heart is yours only yours
Till the end of time

Day by day
I try to live on my own
As I can't escape the ghost of you
Wish that you would be here by my side
And try to make things right

Refrain:
In my heart
Beating over and over
For your love
Is the one thing that I can't let go

Chorus:
Do you really wanna know
What my love is holding on
After all this time That you I'm thinking of
Did I ever crossed your mind
That I can even crossed the line
For this heart is yours only yours
Till the end of time

-Instrumental-

Chorus:
Do you really wanna know
What my love is holding on
After all this time That you I'm thinking of
Did I ever crossed your mind
That I can even crossed the line
For this heart is yours only yours
Till the end of time
