[VERSE 1]
Do you remember when
I said I'd always be there.
Ever since we were ten, baby.
When we were out on the playground
Playing pretend.
Didn't know it back then.

[REFRAIN]
Now I realize you were the only one
It's never too late to show it.
Grow old together, 
Have feelings we had before
Back when we were so innocent

[CHORUS]
I pray for all your love
Girl our love is so unreal
I just wanna reach and touch you, 
Squeeze you, somebody pinch me
This is something like a movie
And I don't know how it ends girl
But I fell in love with my Best Friend

[VERSE 2]
Through all the dudes that came by
And all the nights that you'd cry.
I was there right by your side.
How could I tell you I loved you
When you were so happy
With some other guy?

[REFRAIN]
Now I realize you were the only one
It's never too late to show it.
Grow old together, 
Have feelings we had before
When we were so innocent.

[CHORUS]
I pray for all your love
Girl our love is so unreal
I just wanna reach and touch you, 
Squeeze you, somebody pinch me
This is something like a movie
And I don't know how it ends girl
But I fell in love with my Best Friend

[VERSE 3]
I know it sounds crazy
That you'd be my baby.
But you mean that much to me.

'Cause nothing compares when
We're lighter than air and
We don't wanna come back down.

But I don't wanna ruin what we have
Love is so unpredictable.

But it's the risk that I'm taking, 
Hoping, praying
You'd fall in love with your best friend

[CHORUS]
I pray for all your love
Girl our love is so unreal
I just wanna reach and touch you, 
Squeeze you, somebody pinch me
This is something like a movie
And I don't know how it ends girl
But I fell in love with my Best Friend

I pray for all your love
Girl our love is so unreal
I just wanna reach and touch you, 
Squeeze you, somebody pinch me
This is something like a movie
And I don't know how it ends girl
But I fell in love with my Best Friend

[BRIDGE]
I remember when I said I'd always be there
Ever since we were ten, baby.
