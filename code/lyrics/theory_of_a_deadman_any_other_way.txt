Song:

You've tried to open your mouth but only s**t would come out
I always wondered where you got it from
You haven't heard a damn word I've said,
You never believed in anything I did
I don't care what you're doing, do what you want to,
Look where it got you

You can't help yourself
I know you'll never change
You say you don't need anyone
And wouldn't have it any other way

Just try to open your eyes and try my life on for size
I always wondered who you're hiding from
You haven't heard a damn word I've said,
You never believed in anything I did
I don't care who you're doing, do who you want to,
Look what it got you

Well you can't help yourself
I know you'll never change
You say you don't need anyone
And wouldn't have it any other way

Oh you made a big mistake, and won't admit it
You say you don't need anyone
Oh you made a big mistake, so don't forget it
I know you'll never change
And wouldn't have it any other way

You can't help yourself
I know you'll never change
You say you don't need anyone
You say you don't need anyone
You say you don't need anyone

You've tried to open your mind and leave your last life behind
I always wondered what you're running from

Oh you made a big mistake, and won't admit it
You say you don't need anyone
Oh you made a big mistake, so don't forget it
I know you'll never change
And wouldn't have it any other way
You say you don't need anyone, anyway
You say you don't need anyone
And wouldn't have it any other way
You say you don't need anyone, anyway
You say you don't need anyone
And wouldn't have it any other way
