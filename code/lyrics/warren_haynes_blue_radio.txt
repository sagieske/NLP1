Song:

Rebels facing a brand new world
Standing in the doorway without a clue
Devil's inside all of us
And we'll go right straight to hell before we're through

Yeah heroes, we don't need you anymore
Your frozen strength can't help us with our fear
We've got bottles washing up on every shore
And the message is loud even if it ain't so clear

Yeah, the government rained on your hit parade
But what became of your world once you had it made

Where did you go blue radio?
What about those whose colors were true?
Those golden dreams why did they have to go?
Now there's too much green in between me and you
Blue radio

Big E. And golden Jerry
I watched them change you take your spirit away
Suffering and searching for the mighty dollar
But this game was not what you came to play

Now the lights go down on another stage
And videos and computer drums
Lord, they're all the rage

Where did you go blue radio?
What about those whose colors were true?
Those golden dreams why did they have to go?
Now they're lonely screams dying to cut through

And we try to resurrect the distant sound of thunder
But it's not the same, maybe it'll never be the same

Midnight train rolling in from Georgia
Big O. Ray James and Wild Richard, too
Then the same thing that derailed your glory
It took Jimi and Janis and gave the devil his due

Where did you go blue radio?
What about those whose colors were true?
Those golden dreams why did they have to go?
Now they're lonely screams dying to cut through

Where did you go blue radio?
What about those whose colors were true?
Those golden dreams why did they have to go?
Now there's too much green in between me and you
Blue radio
