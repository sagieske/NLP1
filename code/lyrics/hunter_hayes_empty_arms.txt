Song:

You're gonna miss me, baby
The day that I'm gone
You're gonna miss me, baby
The day that I'm gone
Cuz I'm leavin in the morning
And I won't be back at all
You have run me ragged, baby
It's your own fault, you're on your own
Let me say, you have run me ragged, baby
It's your own fault, you're on your own
You didn't want me no more, baby
Till your other man was gone
You can try to get me back, baby
With all your tricks and your charms
Ohh, you can try to get me back
With all your tricks and your charms
But when your playin games are over
You'll be left with empty arms, yeah
You're gonna miss me, baby

The day that I'm gone
Oh, you're gonna miss me, baby
The day that I'm gone, oh yeah
Cuz you know I'm leavin in the morning
And I won't ever be back at all, no, no
You have run me ragged, baby
It's your own fault, you're on your own
You have run me ragged, baby
It's your own fault, you're on your own
Well, you didn't want me no more, baby
Until your other man was gone
You can try to get me back, baby
With all your tricks and charms
Ohh yeah, you can try to get me back, baby
With all your tricks and your charms
But when your playin games are over
You'll be left with empty arms
