Song:

It's coming down, babe.
Could be as bad as they talked about.
It's coming down, babe.
Could be before we can make it out.

But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost.
But when they say all is lost, all is not lost, no all is not lost at all.

They could be right about it.
They could be right in some crazy way.
'Cause if they yell fire, well that's what we get.
Yeah that's what we get.
Yeah they yell fire, and that's what we get.
So, yeah it's coming babe.
Probably bad as they talked about.
But just remember: when the tide rolls in, it can't be too long until it rolls back out.

And when they say all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost.
But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, no all is not lost at all.

And if they burn, if they burn this place down to the ground, what does it matter?
What does it matter?
So when they say that all is lost, all is not lost, all is not lost.
But when they say that all is lost, all is not lost. No, all is not lost at all
