Song:

I've got you
Somehow you
Don't got me
You let me go
But I just can't
Set you free

These words from the eyes
The one
That I love
Mmm

I'm sorry it hurts
I don't mean to burn
It

Oh

Your eyes
They speak
To me
Like this
I'm hurting inside
No and my heart weeps
Oh darlin'
I'm sorry
But I know you're gettin' tired
Of that phrase
But it's the end of this phase

One more word to say
One more night just looking
In your face
Don't you see
My pain
Strong 'cause you're so calm
Won't you be my lady
Won't you be my lady

Say what you want
But you know we belong
Whether you want to or not
Lonely's gettin' old
I need you to hold
Let's start it all over again
Again
No

One more word to say
One more night just looking
In your face
No won't you see
My pain
Strong 'cause you're so calm
Won't you be my lady
Won't you be my lady
Oh
