Song:

(Fallon, Gaster, Maines, Sult)
Everything gonna be all-right
I went deep down into that river now. I rose up.
I felt that sun beat down upon this sinner's face.
I went deep in that water now. I rose up.
I felt that sun beat down upon my face
Everything gonna be all-right
So the I smash the palace like the son of Samson,
Hollerin' louder than all of Bedlam,
Take me to higher ground,
The bury my body six feet down.
I walked forty miles out into that desert now.
Wailed and moaned, till a Lion, He called my name.
And He said that Old Ship of Zion is taking way way out,
Out into outer space.
And He said everything gonna be all-right
I climbed the highest of the heights.
Atop that mountain I watched the day turn into night.
Oh I tell you I was a wretched sight,
But I stood long and hard until the light.
Rubbing needles in my eyes, eating dirt.
I stood up, and everything was all-right.
