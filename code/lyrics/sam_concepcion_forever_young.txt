Song:

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, forever young

Do you feel the time goes by too fast
You can say the world is going crazy
We're taking in too much too soon
So afraid we'll lose a second of the moment

Have you taken some time to let it chill
Make your mind rest and breathe in easy
Let's go back to the old hangout
It's the only place where we felt it so real

We tried to grow fast and prove who we are
The headlights are on but the road is hazy
Today's the day it won't happen again
If we go back on to recall

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young

When we were little kids it wasn't long ago
We were playing in mud, we had the sun in our face.
Life wasn't perfect but we felt alive.
If you had a bad time, we were there to back you up.

Is it true you said that you have forgotten
How to laugh and talk all about nothing
We made our separate ways but that's over now
It's time to go back where we used to hang out

We tried to go fast and get what we want
Turned on the headlights when the road is hazy
Today's the day we will make it all back
To the place where we feel all so young and happy

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young
Forever, for-for-forever young

It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you wanna go
We're going back to the place
Where we all feel forever young.

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever, forever young

It doesn't matter where you are
It doesn't matter where you wanna go
We're going back to the place
Where we all feel forever young.
