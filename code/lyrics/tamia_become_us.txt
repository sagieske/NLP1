Song:

Oh yeah oh I'm feelin
This one right here

[verse]
Don't know
I don't know what's going on
Somethings happened
I just don't feel the same at all
When you touch me
I just have to close my eyes
Each time you hug me
Feelings happening inside

[Bridge:]
And I
I'm about to say what's always been forbidden
Between us

[Chorus:]
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling
You and I are about to become us
Ohhh

[verse]
Feels like
Feels like I been going crazy for your loving
And even though we're only friends
I need much loving
So much more of you than what you have been giving
Feel us happening inside

[Bridge:]
And I
I'm about to say what's always been forbidden
Between us

[Chorus:]
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling
You and I are about to become us
Ohhh

[verse]
We could become one baby
So much more
In love
And I love you baby
I trust you baby
With my all

[Chorus:]
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling
Baby somethings about to happen
Tell me you cannot feel us falling

Were about to become us bout to become us
