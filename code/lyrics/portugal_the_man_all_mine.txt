Song:

They lead us out from our zoos
A fixed escape still, we didn't know just what to do
It was steps and steps on missing backs
And our hands had been bent backwards to match

It's all mine, All mine

A pacing pace that races through
Our will and bones that never knows just what we do
Oh how we run around and forget about love

A million people in their beds
A million more in other peoples beds
One hundred stuck stayed
While a million more just played
Mixing stories came down from above

It's all mine, All mine

I she'd my skin and just crawled around
My body ached as I was rolling rounds
Felt it as I slipped away
Making parts and mixing up with the stars
