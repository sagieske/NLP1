Song:

I
Let me love you Carmelita
Let me kiss and hold you tight
Must I beg for some affection
From your direction
Night after night

Ii
Let me love you Carmelita
You don't know
What I'd go through
It's no fun
The way I'm thirsting
My heart is bursting
With love for you

Iii
Did your mother
Ever tell you
That it isn't right to kiss
I'm a man and you're a woman
It's only human
To want a squeeze

Iv
Let me love you Carmelita
Just one tender kiss and then
I will bet my bottom peso
On your own say so
We'll kiss again

Repeat iii and iv

Let me love you Carmelita
Just one tender kiss
And then
I will bet Carmelita
I won't have to beg again
Let me love you
Carmelita
