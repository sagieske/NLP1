Song:

Another night you're on my mind
I'm hypnotized but I cannot find the signs
The signs for the tubes to come home
I need the tube to get home
Another night, I'm here alone
My eyes so tired from staring at this phone

Why won't you call and come home?
Please call and come home
And I know you won't come just for the cash
Will you come for my bangers...
My beans and mash?

A suicide in soho grand
My wrists so tired from working with my hands
Please pick me up when I land
Just be there when I land
Another day on primrose hill
I fear I'm fading
I put you in my will

Why has the world gone so still?
The world is so still
I feel my next meal might be my last
Will you come for my bangers...
My beans and mash?
Just come for my bangers...
My beans and mash!

I think I'll stop and drink
The only thing I've ever seem
To see is you!

Love, there's things I've never said
I need to get them off my chest
Before I'm dead
I feel so bloody dead!

(Instrumental)

Another night you're on my mind
I'm hypnotized but I cannot find the signs
The signs for the tubes to come home
I need the tube to get home
Another night, I'm here alone
My eyes so tired from staring at this phone

Why won't you call and come home?
Please call and come home
And I know you won't come just for the cash
Will you come for my bangers...
My beans and mash! ?

Oh come for my bangers!
My beans and mash!

Oh come for my bangers!
... My beans and mash!
