Song:

The story is a famous one
Now worshipped, now dismissed
Rehearsed and trawled for meanings
That may well not exist
The demon at the story's heart
The cuckoo in the nest
Gives little of himself away
Which is of course why you will stay
In case he falters, should betray
By whom or what possessed

These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place
They're laid here before you
So judge if you can -
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man?

His origins, his way of life
His motives - they're all news
No shortage of detractors
To air their noisy views
The man inspires a thousand lies
The lover takes his choise
Remaining coldly in control
Aware that sadly, on the whole
It is the fool who bares his soul
I'll give the man a voice!

These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place
They're laid here before you
So judge if you can -
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man?
