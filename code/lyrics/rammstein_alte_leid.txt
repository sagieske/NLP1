Song:

(The Old Sorrow)

Out of the seed and into the light *
A being pushes me to go
For the same thing and the old sorrow
It catches my tears with laughter
And on the mat a young body rots
Where fate directs it's puppets
For the same thing and the old sorrow
I know at last that nothing is given away here

Out of the seed and into the nothingness
Everyone knows what remains at the end
The same thing and the old sorrow
It drives me slowly to insanity
And the same war rages on the mat
It still always scorches my heart
The same thing and the old sorrow
I know at last...

I want to fuck

Never again, the old sorrow

* The word "Bohne" actually means bean. The two lines that begin the two verses that contain it are referring to life growing out of a bean (and into the light or nothingness). Seed sounds much better in English though.
