Song:

I can't feel your bones but I can see them
And I can't call you up without a reason

I can take a thousand miles and I can drive for hours to your house in the
Summer
But I could stay for longer if you wanted me to

Oh oh oh oh oh
I've been up and I don't sleep enough
And oh oh
I don't sleep enough
And oh oh
I know we don't talk as much but I can hear you still
Oh oh oh oh oh
X3

I can hear your voice on the phone when you're up all alone
Because I am up too
