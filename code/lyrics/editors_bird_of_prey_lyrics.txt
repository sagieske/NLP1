Song:

Every lie you've ever been sold 
The greatest story ever told. 
A circling bird of prey, 
Above a church on a Sunday. 

I wrap myself in you, 
A little something that I can cling to. 
Oh, there you are my love, 
There you are my love. 

Rain down through my hands, 
Scream out like children, 
My heart is a church bell ringing. 

You are a shiver, 
The gold and the silver, 
My heart is a church bell ringing. 

Every lie you've ever been sold 
The greatest story ever told. 
A circling bird of prey, 
Above a church on a Sunday. 

Rain down through my hands, 
Scream out like children, 
My heart is a church bell ringing. 

You are a shiver, 
The gold and the silver, 
My heart is a church bell ringing. 

To the birds, 
To the birds, 
To the birds. 

To the birds, 
To the birds, 
To the birds. 

You are a shiver, 
The gold and the silver, 
You are a shiver, 
The gold and the silver.
