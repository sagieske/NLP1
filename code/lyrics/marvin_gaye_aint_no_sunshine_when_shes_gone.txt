Song:

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And she's always gone too long.
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder this time where she's gone.
Wonder if she's gone to stay.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And this house just ain't no home.
Anytime she goes away.

I know x 16
Gotta leave the young thing alone
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
Only darkness every day.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.
And this house just ain't no home.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
