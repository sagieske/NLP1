Song:

Ah it's another day
And everything feels the same... But
I know everything changes
Yeah I look around
And I see your face turned down
Well I think to myself
What could be missing?
Everybody thinks that everybody knows,
But they won't know till you tell them so
Everyday I'm gonna say I love you
Cuz that's what it'a all about yeah
Everyday I'm gonna say I love you yes I do
Ooh ooh ooh
I've always loved the way that you smile at me
Let your love light shine on
You never really know what you've got till it fades away
Now I've got something to say to you
Everybody thinks that everybody knows,
But they won't know till you tell them so
Everyday I'm gonna say I love you
Cuz that's what it–± all about yeah
Everyday I'm gonna say I love you yes I do
Ooh ooh ooh
Every day I love you
