Song:

Roger Whittaker
The sun has set and golden Clouds, 
Gleam in the evening sky.
I must confess I'd always hoped:
Today would pass me by.

Jessica Whittaker
Oh Dad, I really hate to see, 
The sadness in your eyes.
We always knew this day would come, 
It can't be a surprise.

Roger & Jessica
We had our special day to together.
You were always my best friend.
But the princess and the old king, 
Knew this day would end.

A perfect day, a perfect day with you.
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, 
No other word will do.
A perfect day, a day for you and I.
Now the evening shadows chill my heart
And I can't say goodbye.

Jessica Whittaker
Dad don't worry now I'm grown, it'll be ok.
You taught me well so trust me now
And I'll be on my way

Roger & Jessica
We had our special day to together.
You were always my best friend.
But the princess and the old king, 
Knew this day would end.

A perfect day, a perfect day with you.
Just a perfect day of perfect hours, 
No other word will do.
A perfect day, a day for you and I.
Now the evening shadows chill my heart
And I can't say goodbye.

A perfect day, a day for you and I.
Now the evening shadows chill my heart
And I can't say... 

Jessica Whittaker
I'm leaving home.

Roger & Jessica
Goodbye.
