Song:

Right away from Hollywood
I said to mom, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't going back
To London to the shackler with do-do dance
Some come, hell run
Locker on depart on the baseball bat
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like jfk you know

I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Living the dream like a London Queen

Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like jfk you know

I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Living the dream like a London Queen

I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Living the dream like a London Queen

Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen

I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Living the dream like a London Queen

I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the usa
Living the dream like a London Queen

Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
Living the dream like a London Queen
