Hellfire!

I have always been here
In all forms in all perversions
I will always be here
In all ways in all times

A question in hidding
A solution in disguise
I know no bounds
Like a locust storm I rise

Leprous hell-world
My world
Night world

Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march

I have crossed infernal wastedlands
To plant my flag amongst yer' bones

Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given

Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march

Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given

I have got paths yet to trade
I am abomination

Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march

Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given

There is a rot whitin us
The flames lick through your veins
The abhorrent mark descending
Abomination crawling near

The absolute inhuman
I bear the abhorrent mark
My touch like hell's fire
I am abomination
I am abomination!
