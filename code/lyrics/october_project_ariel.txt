Song:

My name is Ariel
And I want to be free
It is your sorrow
That has made a slave of me
Forgive me
Forgive
But you are all I know
Forgive me for leaving
The day is breaking now
It's time to go away
I'm so afraid to leave
But more afraid to stay
Forgive me
For leaving
The sadness in your eyes
Forgive me
Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand footsteps
Was us all away
Like sand
The sky has fallen
Now the earth is dry and torn
I know your're tired
From the violence of the storm
I love you
I love you
But you are all I know
Forgive me
Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand footsteps
Wash us all away
Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand memories
Wash us all away
Like sand
My name is Ariel
