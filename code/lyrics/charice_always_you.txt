Song:

I've been to so many moments in my life
Where I can't find anyone to turn to but You
Only You
Always You.

And when all that's around me are fallin'
You will remain there standing just for me
Only You
Only You.

In my weakest times, You were so strong
When all hope is gone, You carry on
I draw my strength from You
When I could no longer find any of it in me.

You are my life
You are my strength
I can't fight a battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with You.

'Cause You are my shield
You are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All the love that I have come from You
Always You.

I've been lost in the middle of nowhere
And I can't find my way home
I'm so lost without You
But You have pulled me through.

You took me in Your arms
And You rescued me from the dark
And now, I'm finally home
I feel safe, 'cause now I'm with You.

'Cause You are my life
You are my strength
I can't fight a battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with You.

'Cause You are my shield
You are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All the love that I have come from You.

All the love that I have come from You..

You are...my life
You are my strength
I can't fight a battle alone
I can make it through when I'm with You.

'Cause You are my shield
You are my soul
You're breathing life into my heart
All the love that I have come from You.

Always You, always You
Always You, only from you
All the love that I have come from You
Always You.
