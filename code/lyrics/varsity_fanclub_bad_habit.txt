(Drew)
Girl I've got some things to say
Sit down, put your phone away
Don't want no interruptions
Baby Listen
I can't do this somthings missing
You always said that you would change
Don't try to cut me off baby
Girl, I think you're holding me back
I'm out the door that's that

(Thomas)
Every time I say I'm gone
I prove me wrong
Cause I'm addicted I'm addicted to you

I try and try to leave but I just can't
Let you go cause every single moment
My heart says that I just can't quit
I'm like the ending of a movie that you just don't get
I don't show up late I never forget
You got me running circles in my head
No, I can't quit you're my bad habit

(Jayk)
Know I said I couldn't stay
I try so hard to walk away
But girl you got me itching And got me wishing I could break myself off you
I try to be alone baby but you just take control of me
And I keep tryna hide it And I deny it
I don't need you anymore but

(Thomas)
Every time I say I'm gone I prove me wrong Cause I'm addicted I'm addicted to you

I try and try to leave but I just can't
Let you go cause every single moment
My heart says that I just can't quit
I'm like the ending of a movie that you just don't get
I don't show up late
I never forget You got me running circles in my head
No I can't quit you're my bad habit

(Everyone)
So baby help myself get better
Show me that I'm yours forever
I don't show up late, I never forget
You've got me runnin circles in my head
No, I can't quit your my,
Bad habit

I try and try, to leave but I just can't let you go
Cause every single moment
My heat says that I just can't quit
I'm like the ending of a movie that you just don't get
I don't show up late, I never forget
Youve got me runnin circles in my head
No, I can't quit your my,
Bad habit
