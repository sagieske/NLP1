Song:

Don't waste your time, it will never work,
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse,
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me 'cause I was born to lead.

I'm on your side, don't ever believe,
Don't let anybody tell you, you cannot achieve your dreams,
What are you fighting for?
Let down your guard, lift up your arms,
So look to the sky and be thankful you're here,
The man in the mirror's the one that you fear,
The most, and just like a ghost,
You'll escape your fate, you must not lose your hope,

To be the last one standing up,
And when that day comes,
They'll know what your about.

Don't waste your time cause it will never work,
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse,
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me 'cause I was born to lead.

I've got your back, so f**k what they say,
The hate that they show, don't enable your strength,
Don't stray, stand up and fight,
Run from the answers, no break or words, just fight.
F**k the ones that are holding you down,
Open your eyes, you're wearing the crown,
You are the reason that Jesus exists,
So burn off your face, cause I won't miss how you go.

To be the last one standing up,
And when that day comes,
They'll know what you're about.

Don't waste your time cause it will never work,
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse,
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me 'cause I was born to lead.

The camera's going to show them what you're made of,
Go.

Mother f*****g move.

Don't waste your time cause it will never work,
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse,
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me 'cause I was born to lead.

Don't waste your time cause it will never work,
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse,
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me 'cause I was born to lead.
