Song:

I'm about my issue baby
And you can tell them my name yeah
I'm about my issue baby
Whatever stands in my way yeah

Every time I take...
A chance is all I seek
God with me
I'mma find my way

You came in my house and found a couple hand guns
And a new sk
Catch a cake
Get away by grace God
Stand on the complex
Laugh hard
Man didn't tell you that you're playing hard?
I pull a card on jp
Before your block turns around
Pull a vp
And laugh while lookin' at tv

And I certify my gangster
New Italian suits on my hanger
I got lace and diamond rings
And shiny things
Come try the king

Cause I'm about my issue baby
And you can tell them my name yeah
I'm about my issue baby
Whatever stands in my way yeah

All block nevermind lookin' at her
Look, keep it movin' in that skirt
Men over there try to shoot your guy
It's hard for me to tell
How high I am
Now you see it
Don't believe it still
And all I ever had was a Glock 23 and an instrument
We set the lan and we get the plan
You can ride this and get splashed
You're a wild girl
Go count girl
Even though you keep it down
You're loud girl
You turned down
I don't know how girl

I'm about my issue baby
And you can tell them my name yeah
I'm about my issue baby
Whatever stands in my way yeah

Girl listen, listen, I dream too much
Probably cause I sing too much
Bring your gun to now
Bring your gun to now
Pop it and run to it now
You really got a way so you try to play it down
When they kick you down and run thorugh your house
Cuffs on your wrist
And they cussin' you now
It all makes sense then

Top at the top
Why do we rock?
Grime to provide
Not just to shine
Blood in my eyes
Not on my side

You're playin' with me?
I'mma try it and I'mma show out
If I got to go there
I prepare to go now cause

I'm about my issue baby
And you can tell them my name yeah
I'm about my issue baby
Whatever stands in my way yeah
