Song:

When she wept, I left come over my head
About, oh the feelings
And she wept, hold me again, I made no sound, oh repeating
And she swore love has never come so easily
And we went over again, my head about, oh the feeling

She said you don't need time
We changed, you won't need your maid inside
My faith won't lie
He said you don't need mine
Behave, you want to be my lady lover
Of my eighteen summers, were long
She said, you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't leave me shaking
Leave me shaking

I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

When she said, love come over my head about, oh what feeling
She said, you wanna refund?
Be paid, you ought to see my face in lights
My faith won't lie
But my sweet, you don't need mine your way
Just say you'll love me, just say you'll love me
Look, she said you don't read minds
Be patient, you won't see me shaking
You have been mistaken

I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
But it's all the rage back home
Yeah, it's all the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage back...
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home
I keep falling, maybe half the time, maybe half the time
It's all the rage back home
