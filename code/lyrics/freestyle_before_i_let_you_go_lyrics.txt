Song:

I can still remember yesterday
We were so in love in a special way
And knowing that your love
Made me feel... Oh... So right

But now I feel lost
Don't know what to do
Each and everyday I think of you
Holdin' back the tears
I'm trying with all my might

Refrain:
Because you've gone and left me
Standin' all alone
And I know I've got to face
Tomorrow on my own
But baby

Chorus:
Before I let you go
I want to say I love you...
I hope that you're listenin'
'Coz it's true, baby...
You'll be forever in my heart
And I know that no one else will doohh... yeah...
So before I let you go
I want to say I love you...

I wish that it could be
Just like before
I know I could've given you
So much more
Even though you know
I've given you all my love

I miss your smile, I miss your kiss
Each and everyday I reminisce
'Coz baby it's you
That I'm always dreamin' of

Refrain:
Because you've gone and left me
Standin' all alone
And I know I've got to face
Tomorrow on my own
But baby

Chorus:
Before I let you go
I want to say I love you...
I hope that you're listenin'
'Coz it's true, baby...
You'll be forever in my heart
And I know that no one else will doohh... yeah...
So before I let you go
I want to say

Bridge:
Cause letting love go is never easy
But I love you so
That's why I set you free
I know someday, somehow
I'll find a way
To leave it all behind me
Guess it wasn't meant to be my baby

[Chorus:]
Before I let you go
I want to say I love you
I hope that you're listenin'
'Coz it's true, baby
You'll be forever in my heart
And I know that no one else will do
So before I let you go
I want to say...
So before I let you go
I want to say...

[Instrumental]

I love you...
