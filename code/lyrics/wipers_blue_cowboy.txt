Song:

Blue cowboy rides off thru the range
The Wind it cries his lonely name.
He's on a lonely trail again.
Blue cowboy rides off thru the tide.
The wolves they howlin' out for the lost
But he'll never reach the other side.
Blue cowboy rides off thru the land.
His love it blew away with the dessert sand.
Now his horse is his only friend.
Blue cowboy rides off thru the clouds.
He rode straight into the sun.
They buried him with his boots on.
