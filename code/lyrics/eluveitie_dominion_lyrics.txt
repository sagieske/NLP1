Song:

I, the vermin, the leader, the failure
Brother, I shall not weep when you meet your doom
Not again I shall be your saviour
This nation is moribund, you just can't see
We have to align with the mighty
Lose your soul or lose your life

In the name of Gallia
In the name of my tribe
In the name of my greed
I became the minion
In the name of the Gauls
In the name of the kneeled
In the name of the fold, the name of the sold
I became the lie

Brother, I shall not weep
When you sail to the isles
Atlantic or otherworldly
Be my sentence, be my punishment
Be the sword to piece my heart

You dared to contest
My dear-bought crown
For glories extinct
You waged to evoke
My wrath, my weakness
And my innermost craving for... 

Gallia
In the name of my tribe
In the name of my greed
I became the minion
In the name of the Gauls
In the name of the kneeled
In the name the fold, the name of the sold
I became Rome's slave

Dumnorix, I did quite weep when I betrayed us all
To save us all at the threshold of our demise
Be my penance, be my nemesis
For I sold my soul... 

In the name of Gallia - welcome me, ferryman! 
In the name of my greed - welcome me, ferryman! 
In the name the Gauls
In the name of the kneeled
In the name of the fold, the name of the sold
I came to die
