Words by Phill Mchugh/Music by Greg Nelson
Deuteronomy 1: 31
Storms may rise on seas unknown
While we journey towards our home
Surely we'll learn what grace is for
As we sail to heaven's shore
Send us strength O pilgrim guide
Sin would drown us in it's tide
Be close at hand and go before
As we sail to heaven's shore
Holy Spirit lead us on
Give us courage bring the song
Lord we trust Your Father's care
Will convey us safely there
Open or seal off every door
As we sail to heaven's shore
Straighten our course with every prayer
Let heaven's breezes speed us there
And grant us mercy evermore
As we sail to heaven's shore
Draw us near O finest Friend
>From dawn's light to evening's end
Each passing day we love You more
As we sail to heaven's shore
As we sail to heaven's shore
