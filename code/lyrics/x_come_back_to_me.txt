Song:

He was born with a six - string
Not a shotgun in his hand
And he walked across the water
To reach the promised land

And he searched for the future
For the meaning of our lives
Hearing echoes in the distance
Telling love's so hard to find

Catch the storm
Don't wait until the dawn
Catch the storm
Without you I feel so sad,
Feel so sad

There were endless days and nights
Where our love turned into ice
But the flame's inside still burnin'
Broken dreams in paradise

We called the eyes of the rainbow
To free us from our sins
We searched the night for all lost promises
A fight we couldn't win
