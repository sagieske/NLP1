Song:

As I got up this morning
You watched me and hoped I'd talk to you
Even if it was just a few words
Askin' your opinion,
Thankin' you for something good that happened, Lord
But you noticed I was too busy
Tryin' to find the right clothes matchin' with the right shoes and I
Ran around the house getting ready
You knew there would be minutes to stop and say hello
But I still I were too busy
And at one point I had to wait doing nuttin'
Then you saw me spring to my feet
Thought I wanted to talk
But I ran to the phone
Called a friend: Wassup!

Ok now it's time for us to talk
So I find and empty room but hesitation is in my heart
A look down the hall ...nobody there so I close the door
Take of my new jacket? Man I can't put this on the floor
I'm a have this conversation standin' or my jeans will get dirty
Better yet I'm a sit on this chair right here 'cause I feel a bit lazy
Almost forgot to pull the curtains so no one can look in
And just when I'm about to utter you some words
Someone steps in
Embarrassed by the moment
I jump up and come up with some stupid excuse
Like I was looking for something
All while you were watchin' me patiently
Ready to give more chances
With the hope
That eventually at some point I will speak to you

You give me so much
You wait all day for a nod
A prayer or a thought
A thankful part of my heart

To all my moros back home
All day workin' hard
Struggling all week
Every dawn standing tall

I know you noticed that before lunch I looked around
I felt embarrassed to talk to you
That is why I didn't bow my head
Glanced 3 or 4 tables over, saw some of my friends talking to you
But I did not, there is still more time left
Hope that I will talk to you yet, but I
Went home and seemed as if I had lots of things to do
After that what is on tv
Suddenly I felt too tired to talk to you
Fell asleep in no time without a thought for you
I know it's hard to have a one sided conversation
Well give me some days to try again and again and again

Pasй por enfrente de tu casa esta maсana muy temprano
No me dio ni por llamarte, s
