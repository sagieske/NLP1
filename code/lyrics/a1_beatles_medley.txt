Song:

Baby's good to me you know
She's happy as can be you know
And she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

Baby says she's mine you know
And she tells me all the time you know
She said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine

I'm so glad she's my little girl
She's so glad she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things you know
That he he buys her A diamond ring you know
And she said so
She's she's in love with me and I feel fine

I'm so glad she's my little girl
She's so glad she's telling all the world

She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah (2X)
And with A love like that you know you should be glad

You think you've lost your love
Well I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say

She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She said she loves you
And you know you should be glad (Wwoohhh)

She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she says she know
You're not the hurting kind

Repeat refrain
She loves you yeah yeah yeah
She loves you yeah yeah yeah

With A love like that
You know you should be glad

She loves you yeah...... Yeah..... Yeahh.......
