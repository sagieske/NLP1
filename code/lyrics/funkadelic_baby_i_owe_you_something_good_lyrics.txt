Song:

You came along just in time my love
Self pity had got me down
You saved me from me, and from the bottom of my heart
Baby I owe you something good
You came (you came)
And you saw (you saw)
Don't you know that you conquered (conquered) whoa, my heart (my heart)
Just like the Romans said
To the victors belong, belong, belong the spoils
Unreluctantly I submit. My heart told me that I should
(So) so enriched was my reward
Baby I owe you something good
I've loved (I've loved) and I've lost (I've lost) but that's alright
I blame, I blame, I blame, (I blame) myself (myself)
While this old heart of mine, Lord, it refuse
To love, to love, to love anyone else
And then you came and rectified
All the love this old heart had been denied
Then you saved me like you said you would
For this, I owe you something good
Unreluctantly, I submit
My heart told me that I should
Then you came along and saved me like you said you would
For this I owe you something good
