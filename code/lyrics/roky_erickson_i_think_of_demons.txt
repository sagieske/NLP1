Song:

I, I, I think of demons
They never kill
I, I, I think of demons
They never will

They don't need to
They'll scare it's true
I think of demons for you

First, first, first I read demon
With horns with black tips
First, first, first I read demon
With horns with black tips

Fangs in the dazed moonlight
Blood never touches my lips
I read demon never sips

Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer
Who's been waiting on you
Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer, Lucifer
Who's been waiting on you

Demon eyes and demons do
Wait until you come through
To be our leader
We've been waiting on you
For you

They don't need to
They'll scare it's true
I think of demons for you
