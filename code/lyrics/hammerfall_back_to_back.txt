Song:

They came at dawn into the morning light
Black shadows riding on the mist
Prepared for battle, swords were shining bright
Filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charme
The sound of metal screaming in the air
The time has come where justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now, who are the fools
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
They're fighting hard, their way to victory
Dead bodies lying on the ground
They are soldiers of eternity
And their swords spinning around
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
Kill with power, ready to ride, let's go
They got it all, they'll never fall
But they will fight
The night is falling, light will disappear
A magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning, shining crystal clear
Now they were lost for the chase
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
No, no, no, no
