Song:

You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds
Whatever you do, don't open the wounds
You must undo the dream, as part of your deprogramming
It's what you force yourself to do when change has been forced upon you

It doesn't help to hurt yourself, late at night and most alone
And don't deprive yourself of light as you try to pass the day time
Yesterdays forecast was totally wrong
And I accept the happiness that didn't come

Hold your head up high and revel in the moment you feared would never come
To be standing skywide armspread on a mountain again

Hold your head up high, again, and revel in the feeling you feared would never return, to be
I'm on a mountain again! 

You must grieve your loss, until the grief is gone
But once you've come this far, you can't look back anymore
But whatever you do, don't open the wounds
