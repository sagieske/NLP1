Song:

I'm always missing you every hour I'm not kissing you
I'm filled with loneliness mixed with my happiness
I'm seven shades of blue till the waiting at last is through
Please darling miss me too like I'm missing you
I miss you when the purple shadows cover up the day
I miss you when the morning light tells me you're still away
I'm always missing you every hour I'm not kissing you
Until next time I do I'll be missing you
Your mem'ry gently walks upon the meadows of my heart
To bring this message though you're gone we're just a kiss apart
I'm always missing you every hour I'm not kissing you
Until next time I do I'll be missing you
