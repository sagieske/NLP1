Song:

I was running out in the cold light,
Wondering where to go
To run away, without you

All my fear is coming home,
And it's ripped out for the show
You can't be me,
I will become you, tonight

I was wandering under black skies,
Clutching at what is mine
No control, left to lose
When I felt that it wouldn't phase me,
I ran and hid like a child
I feel so guilty,
I'll make it up to you, tonight

Bridges I've been dreaming are going down,
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground,
Return us our futures

I was breaking out of my own skin,
Choking upon release
I'm in no state, to judge you
Scratching itches best left alone,
Chasing memories I used to own
I can't wait until this is over, tonight

Bridges I've been dreaming are going down,
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground,
Return us our futures

Well the nightmares I've been having have arrived,
They're changing my future
Signs of my creation at my door,
How could you do this to her?
