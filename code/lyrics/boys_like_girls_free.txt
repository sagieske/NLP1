Song:

Carry on, you won't miss me when I'm gone
Won't hear the phone ring
You won't hear me sing
Yeah I'm guilty, guilty of everything
I'll run away
Cause I've gotta find a place where you won't know me
I wanna go so far
Oh I'm guilty, guilty of every charge

Throw away the horoscopes
And don't you ever give up hope
Without me, you will be...
Free, without me
You're free, without me

Settle down
And keep your feet touching the ground
You will be okay
You will see better days
Just watch me
Watch yourself fade away
I love your mind
I love your routine, daily grind
All the words you say
Oh your every day
Just watch me
You'll see I'm gone away

Oh throw away the horoscopes
And don't you ever give up hope
Without me, you will be...
Free, without me
You're free
Free, without me
You're free

Now don't worry 'bout a thing
You can fly without my wings
I know you'll make it on your own, I know
Yeah if you stand up and be strong
I know you'll carry on
And I know that you will see that you're free

Without me, you'll be...
Free, without me
You're free
Free, without me
You're free

Now don't worry 'bout a thing
You can fly without my wings
I know you'll make it on your own, I know
Yeah if you stand up and be strong
I know you'll carry on
And I know that you will see that you're free
Without me
