Song:

Across the miles from heart to heart
We're born alone we live apart
And time slips by like sifting sand
So reach out stranger if you can
And take a stranger's hand.

If each of us could find a way
Too steep and high the words can say
To touch each other openly
To feel that we are more than strangers
That's where love may be.

To feel that we are more than strangers
That's where love may be...
