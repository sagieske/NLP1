Song:

Hey
The walls keep coming down but I'll stand brave
Love is just an empty word you say
I found loyalty and it was pain
And you hate that God keeps coming down
'Cause you're afraid Lucifer just might be your middle name
You're the only angel that got away

And we're all alone now
With nothing to stand in our way
Don't swear that it's over
If love is our secret I know you won't keep it

We're taking this easy
'Cause darling, that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up
So why don't you go back to sleep?

Hey
My walls keep tumbling down but I'll stand brave
Maybe I'm the one who's in your way
I'm the only reason love got away (love got away)

And we're all alone now (yeah, I'll be alright)
With nothing to stand in our way (hell, I'll be just fine)
Don't swear that it's over (with you by my side)
If love is our secret (don't leave me guessing)
I know you won't keep it

We're taking this easy (we're taking this easy)
'Cause darling that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up

So why don't you go back to sleep?
(Just like you never could)
Why don't you dream about me?
(Just like you always should)
'Cause I'm the reason you're alone now
Quit blaming everything on your hometown
Why would you say that?

Oh, oh, oh
I think you're better off when you're on your own
You say to keep me close
'Cause I'm the closest thing that you've ever known
You said the problem's in your heart
But the problem's who you are
So leave me alone now
I'd rather be lonely when I scream and shout
And let it out

We're taking this easy (we're taking this easy)
'Cause darling, that's what dreams are made of
This story is probably made up

So why don't you go back to sleep?
(Just like you never could) (yeah, I'll be alright)
Why don't you dream about me?
(Just like you always should) (hell, I'll be just fine)
Cause I'm the reason you're all alone now
Quit blaming everything on your hometown (don't leave me guessing)
Why would you say that?
