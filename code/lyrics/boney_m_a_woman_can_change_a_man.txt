Song:

A woman can change a man
If she loves him, the way that I'm in love with you
I know it, I know that I can
If it's the last thing, the last thing I'd ever do

So you may still feel the same old yearning
Believe me the flame will soon stop burning

A woman can change a man
If she stays with him whatever maybe in store for her
So just put, your trust in me
I'll never hurt you baby, I'll never desert you babe

It feels so good just to be near you
To feel your lips, to see and hear you
Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...

I'll be forever your shadow, walking next to you
Caring for you, is what I won't do for you baby
A woman can change a man
Make him want her, and make him wanna be with her
Oh baby I've no secret plans
I just hope in my heart, someday you'll be free of her

So you may still feel the same old yearning
Believe me the flame will soon stop burning

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...
