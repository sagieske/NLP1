Song:

I'm quick to flip the script and transform like a Deceptacon
Dope as pharmaceuticals, drink [?] at cafe Escalon
Love dosha dank that make me choke burp and cough
Cause I'm the type of n***a that like to smoke perk and toss
Use them Magnum rubbers baby, cause they be bigger than the rest
And in case you didn't know me homie I represent the Crest (sida)
Haters be mad at me, I pull b*****s with flattery
Have the funk savagely, commit assault and battery
On any man, who think he can serve me some static
Got many friends with mini vans, with fully automatics
Love Evelyn Jones and boy I'm deadly playin bones
Federalies had me gone but now a n***a back at home, its on
Lip poppin no stopping panties droppin left and right
Boy they be jock in, steady shoppin for s** at night
Old school like Atari and I'm dope on my pen
We be M A C D are E aka Silky Slim, from the V
Never drink haterade, Armani suits tailor made
Quick to shake a blade, and broke b*****s I'll never fade
Kick off your Air Maxes relax, while I bust
Cause thou shall not have stress, hutch shall not be trusted
Game spicy, like mustard rushed into your cerebellum
Super saucy ex felon but there's still no telling
What that H O might D O on the D low
So we go super hard on broads and play their a** like cards
Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
Cause this is the season of licks and capers
Unemployment at a record high
People coming, People going who's next to die
I, stay ready with heavy macks and choppas
Tell me can you crack tonight, steada tryin mac some c***
Cause I'm a 3C romp there in nothing higher
Threw a friend in the pen cause a n***a wore a wire
But now I'm back, with crates of raps
Ready to break some backs and make fools face facts
N****s walk around town, jealous with envy
Cause I stay fitted and getting hoes infinity
Representin Windy, Sage and Mark
Leonard, Soya Missen buggy and all
Peanut, Kendal, Kentay and Jack
Ta Ta, Torence, psd andyak
Chewy, Mini eyes and Wayne Howard the dope fiend
Ray Shawn, Da Da, Mac Lee, and Highshadee
Green eyes, Neko, my homeboy Jay
Please don't hurt Baby Rock, Freak E Dee, Dant and Ray
