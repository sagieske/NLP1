Song:

I can feel it again
Let the games begin
Turn the lights down
Inviting the energy
Suddenly, I can see
Something changing in me
Turn away all the pain
Inside me!
Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way
Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate
Yesterday I had died
With frustrations inside
Will I ever change
This part of me
In my mind
I have seen
This was not
Life for me
Took my pain
And I made it something
Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way
Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate
Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way
Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever change me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever break me
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever make me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever make....
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever change me
Nothing you could ever take
Could ever break me
Nothing you could ever say
Could ever make me
Nothing you could ever say....
Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
This is my way
This is my way
Nothing can break me
Or take away the need
It is my fate
This is my fate
Nothing can take me
Away from my escape
It is my way
This is my way
Nothing can break me
Or take away
