Song:

Misty mountain crevices hold treasures buried deep
A blizzard or rain can't wash any memories that you keep
I just came in on the banana boat, got born only yesterday
Came down through the stars, I landed from Mars
Made my way through the Milky Way
Last I saw you metamorphasized, a chrysalis into a butterfly
You opened your wings, such beautiful things and then I saw you fly away so high
A birds eye view up to the stratosphere, all the universe reflected in your eyes
I came to despise, your see-through disguise, your web of lies, and all the empty words you say
I see you like a bubble in the air
But bubbles can rise
Go off pop when they reach the top
I see you like a bubble in the air
But bubbles can rise
Last I saw you change inside, a chrysalis into a butterfly
You open your wings, such beautiful things and then I watch you fly away to die
I just came in on the banana boat, got born only yesterday
Came down through the stars, I landed from Mars, made my way through the Milky Way
I see you like a bubble in the air
But bubbles can rise
Go off pop when you reach the top
I see you like a bubble in the air
But bubbles can rise
Go off pop when they reach the top
I see you like a bubble in the air
But bubbles can rise
Go off pop when they reach the top
