Song:

Someone break these chains
Let me be myself again
I'm lost inside my own reflection
Someone take these eyes
They can see straight though your lies
I'm hunted by my own protection

Are we alive, are we insane
Trying to disguise so much pain
Are we alive, or are we betrayed
Who gives a damn about it anyway?

Someone shake these walls
They have no regret at all
I might adjust my own direction
Someone make me laugh
Tell me she is coming back
Addicted to my own infection

Are we alive, are we insane
Trying to disguise so much pain
Are we alive, or are we betrayed
Who gives a damn about it anyway?

Just don't need to find me gone some night tonight
Wouldn't you tell me if you know, know, know,
