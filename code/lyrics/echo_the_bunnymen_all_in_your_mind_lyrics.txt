Song:

You say your proud to be
One of the people
Hands on the money
And your feet on the ground
Shouting out loud
From the top of the steeple
Counting the flock while
Collecting their pounds
All you theiving wheeler dealers
In the healing zone
Giving me fever fever fever fever
Down to my bones

I pray
And nothing happens
Jesus
It's all in my mind
You say
Stop looking for answers
And reasons
They're all in your mind
All in you mind

Covered in flies
And smothered in lava
I can't scratch my itches
With these pumise stone hands
I dream of my days
As a desert farmer
Living my life
On the fat of the sand
All you theiving wheeler dealers
In the healing zone
Giving me fever fever fever fever
Down to my bones

I pray
And nothing happens
Jesus
It's all in my mind
You say
Stop looking for answers
And reasons
They're all in your mind
All in your mind

Stuck in a world
Losing it's way and wonder
I wonder what happened
To the world we knew
Splitting the atom
And feeling it's thunder
Could never ever make me
Feel the way you do
You give me fever fever fever fever
Down to my bones
Fever fever fever fever
In the healing zone

I pray
And nothing happens
Jesus
It's all in my mind
You say
Stop looking for answers
And reasons
They're all in your mind
All in your mind
