Song:

Are we scared of progression?
Sometimes it seems we've lost our sense of direction
Too scared to take a stand
Too scared to be against
Follow anything
Or just stand on both sides of the fence
Sure we're all safe inside our neutral unions
But we're leaving the foundation of rebellion in a state of ruins
I say fuck the social norm
I won't conform
I'm not concerned with being safe
REVOLT
REBEL
RESIST
Fear of consequences
For speaking our minds
Is just another way of giving into
Forced censorship
And I'm never giving in
REVOLT REBEL RESIST RESIST
