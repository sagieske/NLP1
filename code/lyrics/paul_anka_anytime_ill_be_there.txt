Song:

Anytime you need me babe
Just call I'll be there
Call and see what a good friend can be
When you need someone to care
Nothing more than understanding
Just a man who's undemanding
Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly
Goes when the wind gently blows

And I'm asking nothing of you love
Only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself
As long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you
Just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love
And for need

I love you so, I still do
I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye
Call and I'll come when your world's come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too
And I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell
And sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding
Now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime

There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you
And never run out, never run out (no)
Never run out of what you're all about
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime
