Song:

Leave your cares behind
It'll be just fine
Come on and dance with me
You can dry your eyes
It'll be alright
Come on and dance with me

Verse 1
Another day of an endless fight
That comes to take away your joy inside
Leaving you without a hope or prayer
And it seems no way out of your despair
Let me take a moment of your time
To share a word and help you free your mind
Listen close to what i'm telling you
Here's what you gotta do

Chorus
Leave your cares behind
It'll be just fine
Come on and dance with me
You can dry your eyes
It'll be alright
Come on and dance with me
You can just let go
Goodbye sorrow
Come on and dance with me
It's time you know, that he loves you so
Come on and dance with me

Give him your worries let him care for you
His love and strength will always bring you through
You see I told you it would be okay
You're on your way to a brighter day
So lift your head and put a smile on your face
Leap for joy and dance all over the place
Listen close to what i'm telling you
Here's what you gotta do

Chorus

Bridge
You'll make it over
Because he's right there by your side
And when it's over
There's a joy you can't describe

Chorus
