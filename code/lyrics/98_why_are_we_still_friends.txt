Song:

We do almost everything that lovers do
And that's why it's hard, just to be friends with you
Every time your heart is broken by the fool
I want you to know that it hurts me too
It's hard to wipe your tears away (tears away)
Knowing that you should be with me
Now tell me why

Why? Why are we still friends
When everything says
We should be more than we are
And tell me why every time I find
Someone that I like
We always end up just being friends (Just Being Friends)

I would hate for you to find somebody new
Who you really love, cause it would mean losing you
But am I a fool girl not to say
If I'm always scared I'll lose you anyway
Somehow somewhere I've got to choose (got to choose)
No matter if it's win or lose
Now tell me why

Why? Why are we still friends
When everything says
We should be more than we are
And tell me why every time I find
Someone that I like
We always end up just being friends (Just Being Friends)

I don't wanna be like your brother
I don't wanna be your best friend
I only wanna be your lover
When will this end
If I told you that I wanna be in your life
Then you could be the woman in mine
Now tell me why

Why are we still friends
When everything says
We should be more than we are
And tell me why
Everytime I find
Someone that I like
We always end up just being friends

Why are we still friends
When everything says
We should be more than we are
And tell me why
Everytime I find
Someone that I like
We always end up just being friends
