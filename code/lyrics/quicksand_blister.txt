Song:

Kid, picked on, love, blinds him,
Found, his own girlfriend.
Its all he could ask for.
He doesnt't't need,
His hands,
Tied up,
To persuade, this kid,
Had got, it all, too good.
Bit, dust,
And, said I live for,
I live for you.
Trust, too much, this, is what, you,
Get for this is just another lie,
Just another liar.
He has his hands,
Tied up,
To persuade, this kid,
Had got, it all, too good.
Bit, dust,
And said, I live for.
I live for you.
Trust, bliss, date, faith, trust, hate, share it,
Share it all with you.
I live for you
