(Intro)
Play games with me lady, I'll show you the rules
Keep your head, and you can't lose
You turn around and see what you've done
Stop your man and make him right
And every day and every night
From searching stupid honies on the road
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, I love you
Be around and keep me on the line
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling, I need you
Losing you would be an awful crime
(Solo)
I want to see my lady every night
Turn me on and treat me right
Lay me down and then you count again
Stop your man and keep inside
And every day and every night
From searching stupid honies on the road
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, I love you
Stick around and keep me on the line
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling, I need you
Losing you would be the end of time
(Solo
