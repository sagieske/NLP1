[Song:]
Bartender I really did it this time
Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 AM
The door was locked so I kicked it in

She was trippin on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my shit out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard

And in my drunken stuper
I did what I should have never done
And now I'm sittin here, talking to you
Drunk and on the run

I'm sittin at a bar on the inside
Waiting for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin' car
Crashed that piece of shit and then stepped away

Ya know Moe I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers till they get here
Yea I know the sun is coming up
And yall are probably get ready for closing up
But I'm trying to drown my sole
I'm tired of this life on the dirt road
Everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin on

She got me sittin at a bar on the inside
Waitin for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin car
And crashed that piece of shit then stepped away

[Rap:]
Guess it was meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I am headed to the penitentiary
See me on TV
The next cop series
I am a danger
I guess I should have did something about my anger
But I never learn
Real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love
And watch it burn
I know it's my fault
But I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit
So I crashed that piece of shit Nova

[Song:]
And now I am going back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
And when we all pile out that county van
They're gonna ask me where I've been

I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin for my ride on the outside
She broke my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fuckin car
I Crashed that piece of shit then stepped away
