Song:

We're in the mother f*****g building!
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models

Oh my god waiter,
We packed up in this b***h,
And I'm feeling the hater vapors, yeah it's hot up in this b***h!
But boy you will never faze me,
And I know why you hate me
Cause my f*****g cleaning lady
Look hotter than your b***h,
And you know I'm about to spend
A hundred racks upon this bar, bar.
You don't wanna drink you wanna be noisy Mrs. Ard-Vark
And I know that you not to rejection,
But if you don't get naked get the f**k up out my section!

Chorus:
I'ma need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models

All up in the V. I. P that s**t look like a cloud
Guess Aladin got two hundred Jasmines' coming to the house.
And we're banging on that magic carpet, f*****g on the couch
All the fettuccini say she saw a genie that's that loud
They say silence is golden, so my chain don't make a sound
But these bottles I'm holding I'ma give 'em to the crowd!
Oh, that must be the s**t they're talking about
Can you hear me now or I gotta say it loud?

Chorus:
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
What you want?
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models

I see you standing in the back, babe
Let me help you out with that, babe
You're looking badder than the b***h
You the baddest in the clique, see you picking up the slacks, babe
So let me you back to my place
We're so drunk, so high, babe
Liquor is over, and over, I ain't got no hang over
You can tell by the look on my face I need

Chorus:
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
I need a hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
A hundred f*****g bottles
Stunnin' is my motto
Wit two-hundred bad models
