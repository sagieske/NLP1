Song:

Don't tell me that this is your last chance to change
'Cause if you do, then you would be telling a lie but

I warned you
What could happen if you should decide
To live your life from the 9 to 5
And I'll mourn you;
For that detail that is left unsaid,
Is a reminder of the time you bled

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

They've sold you
Everything you need to fix you up
And you feel good now but you can't wake up
They found a way to reassure you
(That everything would be okay)
Reach out today, now I emplore you
To remember who you are

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

So you felt it, but you don't know,
Why you can't explain at all
Why you felt it, 'cause you don't know,
No you don't know

Break the walls between building atrophy
Causing all your problems to recede
Break the walls between (break the walls between)
Causing all your pain (causing all your pain)
You'll never learn

Return to days when you knew you still felt alive
Reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

(Break the walls between building atrophy)
Take back
The beat in your heart
Why fight
When you can't be bought?

(Causing all your problems to recede)
Take back
The beat in your heart
Why fight
When you can't be bought?

(Break the walls between)
Take back
The beat in your heart
Why fight
When you can't be bought?

(Causing all your pain)
Take back
The beat in your heart
Why fight
When you can't be bought?
