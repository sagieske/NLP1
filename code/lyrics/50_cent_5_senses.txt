Feat. Jeremih

[50 Cent]
I'm gon be honest with you
I expect you to like me
I mean what is there not to like
I'm confident, got a great sense of humour
I'm fun, I'm the kinda person you have fun with

[Jeremih - Chorus]
If you look this good
I wonder how it taste
Baby if I touch your body
Hear you scream my name
Would you whisper to me it's yours
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses
Baby all my senses

[50 Cent - Verse]
It's like everything's good when I touch and you touch
It smells like heaven
Way better than atula
Your love let me taste it
Come here let me taste it
Time's of the essence baby don't you waste it
I tell you what I'm thinking you listen to my thoughts
So you could see my vision, than you'll never get lost
If you follow my lead, girl I'll be what you need
I put my trust in you, 
Now put your trust in me

[Jeremih - Chorus]

[50 Cent - Verse 2]
I'll be a true friend someone to believe in
I'll give you freedom, unconditional meeting
If tonights her night, it's her night
Just get back to me tomorrow girl alright
I'm not into cuffin', I'm not into frontin'

I'm into gettin' paper, blowin' paper I be stuntin'
See to me it's nothing
Lets get into something
Shall I come pick you up meet you at the tele girlfriend

[Jeremih - Bridge]
Would you whisper to me it's yours
Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control my senses

[Jeremih - Chorus]
[End]
