Song:

Chorus
Alive alive lord your spirit is alive
Alive alive lord your spirit is alive
Alive alive lord your spirit is alive
Alive alive lord your spirit is alive

Verse 1
Let my soul look up and my heart shall sing
I have forever more been made new
For the lord doeth live in the praise we sing
Exalt the king your word is true

Chorus

Verse 2
For the lord is great
Yes the lord he reigns
Make a joyful noise all ye lands
Let the earth rejoice
Let the people shout
He is the great, the great I am

Chorus

Vamp
I'm living by your spirit
I'm trusting in your word

Special
With a mighty praise
With a mighty roar
With mighty shout
I lift my voice (we're not saying glory, glory)

I'll lift you
I'll praise you
With power, i'll bless your name

Special alive alive (repeat)
