Song:

I never thought that we would ever come to this
You always said that we were built to last
I thought that we were meant to be together 'til the end, my friend

Now you prove me wrong
Stumbling in your acting
Telling me that we've grown apart, ohh oh

No, I don't want to let you go
I will do it all the same
But you know, I can't stop feeling
I will make it easier
So I will say whatever you- want to hear
But I can't stop feeling

I gather all my things and favourite books
Along with all the memories of you
'Cause I will always love you after all is said and done, you won, ohh oh

I'll be over here
In case you want to see me
Or realize that we're meant to be, ohh oh

No, I don't want to let you go
I will do it all the same
But you know, I can't stop feeling
I will make it easier
So I will say whatever you- want to hear
But I can't stop feeling

No I don't want to let you go
I don't want to let you go

Now you prove me wrong
Stumbling in your acting
Telling me that we've grown apart, ohh oh

'Cause I don't want to let you go
But I will do it all the same
But you know I can't stop feeling

No, I don't want to let you go
I will do it all the same
But you know, I can't stop feeling
I will make it easier
So I will say whatever you- want to hear
But I can't stop feeling

No, I don't want to let you go
I will do it all the same
But you know, I can't stop feeling
I will make it easier
So I will say whatever you- want to hear
But I can't stop feeling

But I can't stop feeling
