Song:

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him
And listen for a while
And there he was this young boy
A stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters
And read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Is killing me softly with his song
Is telling my whole life with his words
Is killing me softly with his song

Ooh... lalalala-lala-la-lala
Lalalala-lalalala
Doorooroo-dadada-lalalala
Oh... lalalala
Doo-doo-dadada-lalalala
Oh... lalalala
Killing me softly with his song

Strumming my pain, woah... oh... 
He was singing my life, yeah... 
Killing me softly with his song
Is killing me softly with his song
Is telling my whole life with his words
Is killing me softly with his song
