Song:

Blood done been running down streets flood with beats
Pepper spray over cracked concrete
So vicious make a rich mans neck split
Underworld bout to wreck s**t bet this
Banks closed stomachs churning
Lines and rows cops blastin out church windows
They heard word of two on a terror list
Hid in the pews just two city terrace kids
One held a piece just for peace of mind
The other was spittin poems blowin minds
On the picket line
Barricades lay cross made with bumpers and burning tires
And you could smell the exhaust
And you could hear the kids screaming don't
Play us, too close
You can have the mic or the heater but you can't hold both

And they were both...
And they were both...

Ocean of tears rise, rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now fill our hearts to tear them down

The water main's cut off panic hit the manor of the
Mayor who's soft
Word hit the streets that the cops got off
They shook to rhythm of heaters that burned
Like claps of thunder
You turn to look at vengeance returned that shatter control
After the whole shock of the news that a bomb hit the
Bridge at broadway
Gridlock full stop every exit way from Chavez to main
Downtown was the same
Every corner a flame with lines of people stripped of they clothes
Freeze hold up your id's their houses burned as they watched
The colonel looked at his clock

And they were all...
And they were all...

Oceans of tears rise, rise a flame to tear them down
Ocean of past crimes now fill our hearts to tear them down
