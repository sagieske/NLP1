Song:

Let's change the subject to someone else.
You know lately I've been subject to change.
Normally I reel in the strange.
Hangover, I'm older.

You're one to talk, the heart is a clock.
Just like a bomb it keeps on ticking away.
Counting down to denotate.
You will need, an army to summon me.

It doesn't matter much to me.
If it doesn't matter much to you.
It doesn't matter much to me.
If it doesn't matter much to you.

It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
And though I hate to rewind (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time.

My past is getting us nowhere fast.
I was never one for taking things slow.
Nowhere seems like somewhere to go.
Come over, and over.

Doing my time for line after line.
When will I learn to sing these crimes to myself?
Prisoners to share a cell with.
I'm holding, still holding.
Holding you in.

It doesn't matter much to me.
If it doesn't matter much to you.
It doesn't matter much to me.
If it doesn't matter much to you.

It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
And though I hate to remind. (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time.

Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you?

It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time. (Before, before)
And though I hate to revise. (Before, before)
It's just a matter of time.

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?

What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?
It's just a matter of time.
Time!
