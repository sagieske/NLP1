Song:

I know you're tryin' to be a big girl
And keep the tears from your eyes
And it's going to be a little hard
To lift your head up high

And you're gonna need a man
A man who'll understand
Whoa, darlin' darlin' darlin'
Please consider me

Well, I know that all your friends
Have left you all alone
And all the good times
You had with them are gone

So you need yourself a man
Yeah, and I'll understand
Well, darlin' darlin' darlin'
Please consider me

Baby, oh I've felt
This way before
Many many many many many
Times before

So you've got to have a man
Yeah, and you know I'll understand
Whoa, darlin' darlin' darlin'
Just consider me

I don't want to be left on the outside
Please consider me babe
I don't want to be left all alone
Please consider me, yeah
I don't want to be left on the outside baby
Please consider me, yeah
