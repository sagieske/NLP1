Intro:
[Makaveli speaking on the One Nation album]
We got to get the n****s that runnin' out of here
So that's what we do
Let the gone, now
Now we got One Nation
With Greg Nice, Buckshot, Smiff-N-Wesson
Smiff-N-Wesson, Melle Mel, Scorpio, The Luniz,
Snoop, Kurupt, Daz, Me, Scarface, Kokane,
Bone Thugs, Spice 1
All of 'em on my s**t
One Nation
And it's just to hit my nation
All the real n****s that I recognize in the game

[Napolean]
Outlaw
With that mutherfucking n***a Yukmouth
Doin' that s**t for Rap-A-Lot
So grap your gat a lot, n***a
Young n****s on the rise, m**********r

[Yukmouth]
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

Verse 1: Napolean
n***a this is war
We get the s**t together right now, n***a
After midnight,
This full pound gon' make some sound, n***a
Kick in the door
I throw your wife on the couch
I put my d**k in her mouth
And put that s**t in and out
Outlaw no doubt
Ha, what you don't talk some s**t
Ha, what make Napolean flip
I blow your
Backbone to your mot*****in' lap hoes
If you wig it, I'ma take it down
Who do you, gotta stay low
Ha, make a move, n***a
When your sure improved, n***a
Outlaw soldier
Take it to school, n***a
We rule n***a
Have it
Will rap about your gat or won't you grab it
Feelin' hot like a weapon
Gettin' 16 for my automatic
Thugged out to the overdoses
You n****s got to sell 'em some s**t
You probably thought you could leave quick
It ain't happenin' b***h
It's hard to get mob on mine
Outlawz my spine
It ain't hard to find
But get ya, and lay low
And get ya pis by the dough
I keep my s**t on c***, cause Makaveli said so
I keep my s**t on c***, cause Makaveli said so

Chorus:

[All]
If you,
[E. D. I]
Got to get your money on
>From night till mo'
You better
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Yukmouth]
Buy Chronic by the zone
Then get yo smoke on
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Young Noble]
Resign the streets
Because you love to bang
[All]
Then do yo thug thang
If you,
[Napolean]
Don't give a f**k about life
I lost my family twice
So I'ma
[All]
Then do you thug thang

Verse 2: E. D. I (Yukmouth)

I been what is know as a bandit (Bandit)
You better hand it over,
If you wanna see your grandkids (Grandkids)
I don't give a f**k (Fuck)
Cause Makaveli planned it
(Cause Makaveli planned it)
But when it's said and done
In the streets
We can handle it
Do yo thug thang, o really (Really)
You don't wanna see me silly (Silly)
With fully loaded 9 milli (9 Milli)
When it get to spittin'
You gon be sittin' me

I'm the epidemy of everthing you fear (Fear)
Crystal clear (Crystal clear)
Pistol there (Pistol there)
In the air
I hit you there (There)
Hit you there (There)
Then I'm out of here (Here)
With your Cartier (Cartier)
And your hottie head (Hottie head)
Between knees (Knees)
I got on the clean knees (Knees)
You ain't see no
Thugs like these,
With slugs like these
We rush tightly
All in together now
Makin' it mo better now
(Makin' it mo better now)
Layin' competitors down
Ahead of you now
Superial style
Grand imperial thug world
I'm rougher for rhyme
I had you wanted for mine
While I'm gunnin' for mines (Mines)
Thought it was gone, but still on
We commin' to town
(You rainin', clickin' n****s,
That will see us, man)
You rainin', clickin' n****s,
That will see us, man
But if you think,
You can't do yo thug thang, n***a
(Do yo thug thang, Nigga)

Interlude:
[Yukmouth]

F**k You
f**k the Outlawz
f**k the Régime

N***a

Verse 3: Young Noble

If you ain't,
Lovin' this thug s**t
You must be a b***h
Can't compete with the bricks
All the drugdealers rich
Or try to get in
Try to hustle and pear
Walkin' up and down block all day,
'till the rest of the fiends get here
A b***h named Tarifa
She owned 300 thugs
On a n***a to hold her beaver
>From the blow I fronted
And do yo thug thang
Rappin [?] drugs slang
[?] and have you losin' you brain
Abusin' the game
So now you're in danger
Lyrically I ruin your name
And keep one in the chamber
Nasty new street slugger,
Catch you with a boxcutter
Used to fight with my brother
And run the spot with my mother
You get after, ask her quick
And s**t blast the b***h
fu***n' around with this Outlaw s**t

[All]
Get your thug on n****s
Ha, then do yo thug thing

Chorus

Verse 4: Yukmouth

N****s used to hit me up
Till they see that fu***n' Régime
Stick me up, up in the sky
Firebreatin' dragon
n****s bout to die
n****s feel like Armageddon,
When I be headin'
And wait n****s up at they own wedding
With they own weapons
Counterfessons
Ghetto lesson number one:
Never try to go to war without your gun
n****s get done
Since I quit fu***n' with Num
I did once like Big Pun
Off the books,
Have your body in a coffin up
n***a I'm off the hook
Like a phoneless chuck
That burned out
Thugged out and turned out
Set that motherfucking perm out your head
n****s dead,
If you ain't Régime, or Outlaw
Kiss the ring
I do my thug thing without y'all
Matter of fact
I gives a f**k about y'all
Put a n***a up in a ho
Just like a ground hole
Thanks of the Hounddogg
They finally found y'all
Leavin' [?] on your face
And about 12 mot*****in' bodies,
Hangin' around y'all
I do my thug thang
Dopin' in and out of lanes
And I must thank
[?]
Tats on my arm
I better ring the fu***n' alarm
Or be the first that get mashed on
n***a, do yo thug thang

Chorus: x2

[Napolean]
Uhhh
