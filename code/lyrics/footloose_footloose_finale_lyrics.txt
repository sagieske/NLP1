Song:

I've rented my tux
Bought flowers
12 bucks
And on my 23rd try
I finally tied my tie!
I got this feelin
That time's no longer holding me down

Been feelin so strange
My life is about to change
I know just how she feels
It's what happens when you wear heels!

Let's hit the ceiling
And then let's tear up this town

Tonight we're gonna cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off a my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

I got this feelin
That time ain't holdin me down (time aint holdin me down)
Let's hit the ceiling
And then let's tear up this town
Oowee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Oh, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let's go
Cut footloose
Cut footloose
Oohohhohh

First we gotta turn you around
Then put you're feet on the ground
Now take a hold of your soul
Cut footloose (take a hold of your soul)
Everybody cut
Everybody cut
Everybody cut
Everybody cut
Everybody, Everybody, Everybody
Everybody cut footloose!
