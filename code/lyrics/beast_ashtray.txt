Song:

I used to think it was all about me
I was victimized by everything
I used to lose and I lose again
Now I'm living like a cigarette in an ashtray

I used to think it was all about me
I used to suffer through everything
I used to lose and I lose again
Now I'm dying like a cigarette in an ashtray

Rembering
Where you came from
Surrendering
When you're ending
Reprocessing
Rembering where you come from when you're ending
What you have lost what you can win
Rembering where you come from when you're ending
What you have lost what you can't win
Acknowleding where you come from when you're ending
What you have lost what you can win
Acknowleding where you come from when you're ending
What you have lost what you can't win
Surrendering what you're made of
What you're made from
What you have done
When the end comes
Reprocessing where you came from when your ending
What you have lost what you can't win
Reprocessing what you're made of
What you've become, all you have learned, what you have done
Reprocessing, what you're made of
What you have done, when you're bleeding
Rembering

Rembering

Reprocessing

You like to think it's all about you
You are victimized by everything
You do the same things over and over again
Soon you'll be lost like a cigarette in an ashtray

He used to think it was all about him
He was victimized by everything
He did the same things over and over again
I lost him like a cigarette in an ashtray
