Song:

This was always the last place
I expected to be
Once upon an apocalypse
So better make the most of it
So I said to the horsemen
Have a Coke and a smile
So I said to the horsemen
Why not stick around for a while?

But they said You Got The Wrong One Baby
The New Generation is pushing up some daisies
And by decree of Rapture Inc.
We're closing this here market permanently

Coming down like a ton of lead
More bang for your buck
More pangs for the dead
Coca Cola and Armageddon
I like it, like it, yes I do

So they
Tried to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
But it was way off key
So here comes the big rc
The melting pot boils
The bible belt breaks
And young America begins to sing

Coca Cola and Armageddon
We like it, like it, yes we do
Coca Cola and Armageddon
It's The Real Thing now
Come and get it
