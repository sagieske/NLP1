Song:

Damn, damn

{Verse 1}
Damn cold world, I never thought I'd see the day that you my old, girl
Now I'm stuck here hollerin' at old girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls shotgun in the drop
Made a right, hut one hut two, told them hos to take a hike
Then it's on to the next, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

{Verse 2}
I wanted some time, I wondered if I was wrong
Trying to do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

{Bridge}
'Cause her eyes and those hips and that don't compare at all
And I bet all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

{Chorus}
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that your gone, gone, gone

{Verse 3}
'Cause being your friend is killing me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault, and the wrong time I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausting

{Bridge}
'Cause her eyes and those hips and that don't compare at all
And I bet all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

{Chorus}
All I want is you, mmm
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that your gone, gone, gone
All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that your gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

{Verse 4}
'Cause they don't smile or smell like you
And they don't make me laugh or even cook like you
And they photograph not even s** like you
Lets face it, I can't replace it, that's why all I want is you

(Verse 5}
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal
Trying to celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl who I'm kidding, still sick, real s**t
All my new b*****s seem to get old real quick
Could it be you everything these lame b*****s couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be
Lost in the player way sort of get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say I'm wrong you say come again
Damn, said I was wrong don't rub it in, I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes, like a line full of hos
Look how they coming in, just saying
You don't wanna have me, then someone will, I'm playing
Weight on my chest like I body build, I'm praying
You ain't content with trying to do you your own thing, come back baby
Boomerang

{Chorus}
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that your gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

You know that your gone, gone, gone
I want you back
