Song:

It's hard to breathe when you're choking yourself.
It's hard to see through eyes misleading.
Though I swear I've been here before.

So please, oh please pick up your feet I can't carry you
Anymore. Anymore.

In a world of disbelief these words are guidance.
In a world of disbelief these words are guidance.
That one should follow.

So please, oh please pick up your feet I can't carry you.
So please, oh please pick up your feet I can't carry you.

So say your prayers for the last time, You're a victim of your own lie.
You're a failure, You're Wrong.

We lay our hearts into a pool of filth, we are lead by false pretenses.

In a world of disbelief these words are guidance.
In a world of disbelief these words are guidence.
