Song:

According to my heart you're the one for me
The one love of my life is here when you're with me
If someone stole your love my heart would beat no more
For you're the one my heart is always longing for
Though I don't know the reason why my dreams don't turn out right
Still I'll keep listening to my heart who knows someday they might
For according to my heart the future will be bright
And every day I pray that my heart knows what's right
[ fiddle - steel ]
According to my heart...
