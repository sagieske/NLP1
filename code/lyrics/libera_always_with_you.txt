Song:

Do you know me, Who I am
I am always with you
I am near you every day
Always share what you do.

Follow the path to anywhere
A stranger in the world without you
Forever I will be there
The shadow you always knew.

If you think I've gone away
And I'm never with you
I am not so far away
Always shadowing you.

Follow the path to anywhere
A stranger in the world without you
Forever I will be there
The shadow you always knew.

Beati quorum via, integra est
Beati quorum via, integra est

Do you know me, who I am
I am always with you
I am not so far away
Always shadowing you
Always shadowing you
