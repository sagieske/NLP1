Song:

Hey you, see me, pictures crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing, to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore

Anymore... Nananananananananana

Hey you, are me, not so pretty
All the world I've seen before me passing by
Silent my voice, I've got no choice
All the world I've seen before me passing by
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
I don't see, anymore
I don't hear, anymore
I don't speak, anymore
I don't feel

Nananananananananananana... (x2)

Hey you, see me, pictures crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing, to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care about how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
I don't sleep, anymore
I don't eat, anymore
I don't live, anymore
I don't feel
