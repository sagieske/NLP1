Song:

Grey is the sky today and so is my heart
Memories of a friendship that now seems so far,
Chased dreams of past days...I was really fine!
I have never thought my best friends could ruin all this time

I told you about my jealousy and what makes me feel sad
Don't you really understand why I feel so bad?
Are you still the girl who, smiling, won the fight
Against the run-down battery of my broken car?

That's a song to say goodbye, to a girl that I still love as a friend
I hope she'll understand what I mean...

Everything falls down to the ground
Everything i hate: it happened!
Now i ran away: it's over!

The cd players is running. That is our song.
It reminds me of a the time gone, where I don't belong.
This is my decision: we won't meet again!
That's the only way in which we can still be friends

Please don't say anything!Please don't say a word!
I want you to run away instead of fighting against the world
I won't to take a step back, I won't look back no more
Just becauseI'm scared of how much I felt lost before....

That's a song to say goodbye, to a girl that I still love as a friend
I hope she'll understand what I mean...

Everything falls down to the ground
Everything i hate: it happened!
Now i ran away: it's over!

Everything falls down to the ground
I won't meet again the girl I
Want to be my friend. It's over!
