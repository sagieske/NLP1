Song:

All your love I miss lovin'
All your kiss I miss kissin'
All your love I miss lovin'
All your kiss I miss kissin'

Ever since I left you baby, I never knew what I was missin'
All your love I miss lovin'
All your kiss I miss kissin'
All your love I miss lovin'
All your kiss I miss kissin'
Ever since I left you baby, I never knew what I was missin'

All your lovin pretty baby
That I had in store for you
All your lovin pretty baby
That I had in store for you-
What could a poor boy do?
All your lovin pretty baby
All your lovin pretty baby
All your lovin (x's 7) pretty baby
What could a poor boy do?
All your lovin pretty babay
All your kissin is kissin
All the lovin you gave me pretty babay
Ever since I left you baby,
I n-n-never knew what I was missin' aaaah
