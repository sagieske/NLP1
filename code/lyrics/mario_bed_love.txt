Song:

Ohh ohh yeah

If I told you would you wanna stand over you turn away
All I did was fornicate can't capting moving
But everything get anything when you can't feel a thing at all, no
I don't really know when I can feed em anyone
But I'm not a man in my place I didn't have no gorgeous
They're gorgaine, being selfish rich your love

So I just stand here in the middle of love and goodbye
Waiting for your heart to... And show me
I'm afraid, tell me I'm invited 'cause I just don't know if you're willing to

Chorus:
Without touch just we're here tonight I wanna make you fall in bed love, bed love
Bed time, bed love,
Don't be mad just be clear, tonight I wanna fall in bed
Love bed, love bed, love bed, love bed
Baby I don't know something you've been giving on
And that could be love or you just wanna...
With that set just we hear
Tonight I wanna make you fall in bed love bed, love bed,
Love bed, love bed

So I chose the show inside of me wasn't alive
And it's all because of your modesty that love just to fought
I see the way that you look at me stop reading my mind
My heart, rewhine, gotta control this one more time
I can tell you believe, you can see
More things, that I can, that I can... Wish I could, wish I see
But I can't and I don't know if I'll ever feel
Probably 'cause I can tell when it's feel
So I just stand here in the middle of love and goodbye
Waiting for your heart to call and show me
... Tell me you're invited 'cause I just don't know if you're winnin

[Chorus:]

Everybody needs something that everything get enough
And if we live it for the moment
Everything get too much
It was one thing baby that you
Maybe I don't wanna miss the time

[Chorus:]
