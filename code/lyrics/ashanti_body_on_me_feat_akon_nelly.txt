[Chorus:]
The way that you walkin, the way that you talkin
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the morning
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me

[Verse:] (Ashanti)
Hey boy
I think I just might wanna come see you tonight
And you can have your way boy
I know it's been a while since you made my body right
Now I've been waiting patiently, anticipating you and me
And it aint no question cuz boy I love you when you put that body on me

[Chorus:]
The way that you walkin, the way that you talkin
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the morning
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me

Hey how you doin mama

You givin me the eye eye

What we should do today
Go tell you friends bye bye
And lets go hop a plane
It's no mistaken the attractions ironic
I wanna make you someone more then just a a bon in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
Where you wanna come hang when your man is trippin
You say your short this month and your late on your rent
He took your car watchin me hold this
Hey hey you see oohhh
You see lil mama outta control

[Chorus:]
The way that you walkin, the way that you talkin
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Tryna get in them draws and bang it out til the morning

Cause you shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me

Cause you shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin dat body on me
