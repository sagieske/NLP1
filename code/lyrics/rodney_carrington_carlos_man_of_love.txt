Song:

Good evening, your dream is here for I am Carlos
You think I'm s*** and your right,
Come a little closer I wont bite.
I see the love that's in your eyes,
Between my legs you'll find a prize.
For I am what your dreaming of,
I am Carlos man of love.
Around the world they call my name, there is only one of me what a shame.
We will roll around in the grass,
You naughty girl you grabbed my a**.
I am what your dreaming of,
I am Carlos man of love.
You look so nice your so pretty.
Of course you wont mind I touch your titty.
Spread your legs for I am here,
I make my wiener disappear.
I am what your dreaming of,
I am Carlos man of love.
Feel free to go a head,
Touch me right there,
Look at my crotch,
Look at my crotch and
Feel the heat off your eyes touching my crotch.
I am what your dreaming of,
I am Carlos man of love.
