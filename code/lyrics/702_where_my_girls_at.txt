Song:

[Verse One:]
See, he's my property,
And any girl that touches,
I might just call your bluff,
'Cuz I don't give a...
Who are you to call my cell,
Oh I'm gonna wish you well,
'Cuz any girl that tried has failed,
But...

[Chorus:]
Where my girls at,
From the front to back,
Well is you feelin' that,
Put one hand up,
Can you repeat that,
Tryin' to take my man,
See I don't need that,
So don't play yourself.
Where my girls at,
From the front to back,
Well is you feelin' that,
Put one hand up,
Can you repeat that,
Tryin' to take my man,
See I don't need that,
So don't play yourself.

[Verse Two:]
Hey hey hey hey,
Don't you violate me,
'Cuz I can make you hate me,
If you decide to mess with mine.
Chop you down to size,
Make you realise,
That you done messed up this time.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You must learn the rules,
Don't come close to,
Anything that belongs to me.
He is mine,
My property,
So you must leave.

[Repeat Chorus to fade]
