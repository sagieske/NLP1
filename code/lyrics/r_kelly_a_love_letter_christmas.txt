Do do do do do do
Do do do do
This is a Christmas remix
And it's sang
La la la la la la
La la la la

Yea... Yea

Did you get my card?
Did you read my love letter?
Did it touch your heart?
When you read my love letter

Pour the wine, read the signs
Baby, it's Christmas time
You and me underneath this tree
Candles, stories told
Kisses under mistletoe
And every ones' asking their family

Did you get my card?
(Christmas card)
Did you read my love letter?
(Did you read my love letter)
Did it touch your heart?
(Did it touch your heart, girl?)
When you read my love letter
(My Christmas love letter)

Sleigh bells, sweet dreams
Kids are sleep, you and me
Wrap the gifts I can't wait til morning
Cuz, this moment's so heaven sent
Marshmallows, hot chocolate
Fireplace, you and me cuddling

Did you get my card? (my card)
(Did you get my card girl?)
Did you read my love letter?
(Tell me did you read my love letter?)
Did it touch your heart?
(Did it touch your heart?)
When you read my love letter
(When you read my love letter)

(My hope is) I hope these words find you
I wrote this letter according to my love for you
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box
Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love
Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder
If you are reading this I hope that things are well
And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail

Did you get my card (My Christmas card, yea baby)
Did you read my love letter (Did you read my love letter, girl)
Did it touch your heart (When you read it)
When you read my love letter (My love)

Did you get my card, did it make you smile, yeah?
Did you read my love letter? Did it leave you again, yeah?
Did it touch your heart? Did it make you wanna try me back, baby?
Did you get my love letter? Did you get my love letter?
All the latest things, hold me

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Latest things
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Sound beautiful, sound real good
Break it down, I wanna have some fun, give me the cowbell
Y'all wanna have some fun with me?
It's Christmastime, we might as well have some fun, uh

Break down, break it down
Break down, break it down, uh

I'm a tell you who I am, I'm a tell you what I'm looking for
Now when I tell you what I'm looking for
If you fit that description, come my way, baby, uh

I am just a snowman and I'm looking for a snow girl, come on
I am just a snowman, come on, baby
And I'm looking for a snow girl
Yeah, freestyle

It's Christmas time in the hood and everybody is charged
This beat's so out of this world, they're stepping up on Mars, yeah
So move them mopes, walk on in, say, hell with security
'Cause Kell's is having a Christmas party and everybody's V. I. P.

Now I know we all have our problems
I'm just trying to make it better
So I had to put on my music cape and write this love letter
Come on, baby
