Song:

Yeah, yeah
I see you, girl
Dark Child
I got my eyes on you, Monica
Let me see what you workin' with
Let's dance


When I step in the club, so much love
All eyes on me
All the girls and thugs ??? go up
It's their time, baby


If you're lookin' right and your game is tight
Come chill with me
Get up on the floor and dance some more
The night's just diggin' me, oh, ho, oh


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


And when I'm doin' my thing you're checkin' for me
Just step my way
Don't you be too shy or be ashamed
You'll get love from me


So when we move in close, we're toe to toe
Just dance with me
And when we've come to me and my friends
We'll do it again


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


Come on let me see you work it out
On a pretty young thing you could turn it out
Party all night, workin' it out
Till the lights out, till the early morn'


Come on let me see you work it out
On a pretty young thing you could turn it out
Party all night, workin' it out
Till the lights out, till the early morn'


Don't you know now is the perfect time
I can make it right makin' you all mine
Baby, tonight if you hold it down
I can give you all that I got


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


I can feel your eyes on me, you're watchin'
And off up in the club tonight is poppin'
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
I know you do


I see you, you're watchin' me
I see you, all eyes on me
I see you, you're watchin' me
I see you, all eyes on me
