Song:

He'll be the bride of the darkness open wide
She'll feel the bite
Of the night before the prime

And if he's alright
When the shadow comes alive
In the middle of the night
She's going to the other side

Dead, dead
So dearly departed
Dead, dead
So lost and brokenhearted

Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead! All they want to do is rock

When the moon is high
Still live and the candles die
Here comes the bride
Raven hairs get milky white
She's hot as ice
You gotta keep her off your eyes
She's going to the other side

Dead, dead
So dearly departed
Dead, dead
So lost and brokenhearted

Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy

Dead! All they want to do is rock

Dead, dead
So dearly departed
Dead, dead
So lost and brokenhearted

Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
Dead, dead! Dead girls are easy
