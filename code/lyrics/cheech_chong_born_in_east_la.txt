Song:

(Cheech:)
Took a walk to the corner store
Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores
Up pulled a guy in a yellow van
Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand

(Chong:)
He said, alright all you mojados down here
I want you all to hit the floor
I got one thing to ask you and nothing more
So answer in English, if you can
Where were ya born, man

(Cheech:)
Huh? Where was I born?

(Chong:)
That's right, I said
Where were ya born?

(Cheech:)
Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man
Hey, I'm a Cancer with a bad moon rising

(Chong:)
Look here el fago, watch my lips
Where were ya born?

(Cheech:)
I was born in east L. A.
Man, I was born in east L. A.

(Chong:)
Oh yeah, you were born in east L. A.
Let's see your green card

(Cheech:)
Huh? Green card?
I'm from East la

(Chong:)
Alright, then who's President of the United States

(Cheech:)
Oh, that's easy, man
That guy that used to be on Death Valley Days, John Wayne

(Chong:)
Alright, let's go, come on

(Cheech:)
Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land
People talkin so fast, I couldn't understand
There was nobody there to lend a helping hand
I was cold, it was dark where is a burger stand

I want to go back to East la
I wish I was back in East la
I don't belong here in downtown T. J.
Cause I was born in East la, ole

I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream
Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine
Walked all day in the burning sun
Now I know what it's like to be born to run

Up ahead was the promised land
Shining like a star just beyond my hand
All I could see was a golden door
I looked up, a sign said five billion sold

And I was back in East la
Yes, I was back in East la
You know I'm never gonna stray
Cause I was born in East la, oh la

(adlibs with I'm a low rider rocker in East la, oh la)

East la!!!
