Song:

Get your bravery from a six pack
Get your bravery from a half-pint
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up and you don't feel pain

Go out and fight, fight
bottled violence

Lose control of your body
Beat the s**t out of somebody
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
But you don't take any s**t

Go out and fight, fight
bottled violence
