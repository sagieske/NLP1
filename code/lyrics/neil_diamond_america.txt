Far
Weve been travelling far
Without a home
But not without a star

Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream

On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to america
Never looking back again
They're coming to america

Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, were travelling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and well say grace
Freedoms light burning warm
Freedoms light burning warm

Everywhere around the world
They're coming to america
Every time that flags unfurled
They're coming to america

Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to america
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to america

They're coming to america
They're coming to america
They're coming to america
They're coming to america
Today, today, today, today, today

My country tis of thee
(today)
Sweet land of liberty
(today)
Of thee I sing
(today)
Of thee I sing
(today)
