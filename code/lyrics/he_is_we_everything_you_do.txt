Song:

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

Let me introduce myself,
I'm all smiles.
You may know me as a former 'most love only last a while. '
Pessimistic, so realistic,
You get the picture.
I met you now my world is so much bigger.

Upside down, off the ground is what you do.

When you touch me, it's like the very first time.
I'm so lucky, to say that you're mine.
I still get those stupid butterflies,
But it's just what you do,
I'm loving everything you do.

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

Crazy how it happened so fast,
Truly blows my mind.
Going on a hunt for four leaf clovers,
To wake up to that smile each sunrise.
Whenever I'm not by your side,
I get home sick.
A little pathetic, with a dash of ooey gooey so romantic.

Upside down off the ground, God I love you.
Upside down off the ground is what you do.

When you touch me, it's like the very first time.
I'm so lucky, to say that you're mine.
I still get those stupid butterflies,
But it's just what you do,
I'm loving everything you do.

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

I'm loving everything you do.

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do

Yes sir you came and you took my breath,
My head is feeling a little light.
All right, I hope that you feel it too.
Yes sir you came and you took my breath,
My head is feeling a little light.
All right, I hope that you feel it too.

Oh everything you do.

I still get those stupid butterflies,
But it's just what you do.

When you touch me, it's like the very first time.
I'm so lucky, to say that you're mine.
I still get those stupid butterflies,
But it's just what you do,
I'm loving everything you do.

Everything you do,
Everything you do.

I'm loving every single thing you do,

I'm so in love with everything you do.

Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do
