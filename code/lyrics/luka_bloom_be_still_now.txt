Song:

I walked along the western shore
One bright November day
I watched the heron watching me
And thought I heard him say

Just be still now
Wait a while
And let life come to you
Just be still now
All your dreams
Are on the breezes passing through

I walked along the city streets
And wished that I could fly
I saw the heron by my feet
And thought I heard him say

Just be still now
Wait a while
And let love come to you
Just be still now
All your dreams
Are on the breezes passing through

Just be still now
Just be still
