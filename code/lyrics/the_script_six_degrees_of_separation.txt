Song:

You've read the books, 
You've watched the shows, 
What's the best way no one knows, yeah, 
Meditate, get hypnotized.
Anything to take from your mind.
But it won't go

You're doing all these things out of desperation, 
Ohhh woah, 
You're going through six degrees of separation.

You hit the drink, you take a toke.
Watch the past go up in smoke.
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that, 
I'm better now than ever, and your life's okay
Well it's not. No
You're doing all these things out of desperation, 
Ohhh woah, 
You're going through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else 
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have messed up a little.

(No, no, there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)

You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too, 
Anyone'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Tarot cards, 
Gems and stones, 
Believing all that shit is gonna heal your soul.
We'll it's not, no

You're only doing things out of desperation, 
Ohhh woah, 
You're goin' through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else 
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have messed up a little.

No there's no starting over, 
Without finding closure, 
You'd take them back, 
No hesitation, 
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

No there's no starting over, 
Without finding closure, 
You'd take them back, 
No hesitation, 
That's when you know you've reached the sixth Degree of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else 
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have messed up a little.
