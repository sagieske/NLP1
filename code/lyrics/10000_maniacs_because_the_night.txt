Song:

Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, n' try n' understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

C'mon now, try n' understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now...

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, on the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

C'mon now, try n' understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now...

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious cycle turns, n' burns
Without you oh I cannot live, forgive the yearnin' burnin'
I believe it's time, too real to feel, so touch me now, touch me now, touch me now...

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
