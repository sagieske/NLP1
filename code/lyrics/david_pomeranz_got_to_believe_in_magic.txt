Song:

Take me to your heart,
Show me where to start,
Let me play the part of your first love;
All the stars are right,
Ev'ry wish is ours tonight, my love.

Pity those who wait,
Trust in love to faith,
Findin' out too late that they've lost it;
Never leting go,
They will never know the ways of love.

Got to believe in magic,
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers;
You've got to believe in magic,
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love.

I may never know
Why I need you so,
All I need to know is this feeling;
Handle it with care,
We were born to share this dream, my love.

Got to believe in magic,
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers;
You've got to believe in magic,
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love.

Got to believe in magic,
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers;
You've got to believe in magic
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love.

Got to believe in magic,
Tell me how two people find each other
In a world that's full of strangers;
You've got to believe in magic
Somethin' stronger than the moon above
'Cause it's magic when two people fall in love.
