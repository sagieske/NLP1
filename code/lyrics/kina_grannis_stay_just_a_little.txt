Song:

I heard it in your voice when your love died
On a telephone connection stretching miles and miles of wire
You said it was over and then cried and cried
You were gone before I said goodbye

I don't like to think it is true
That distance came between us like a knife and cut right through
Where did we go wrong and let it all undo?
The only one I ever loved was you

Chorus:
Would you stay just a little, my love?
Would you sway just a little, my love?
Because the hole in the middle of my heart needs filling up
If you stay just a little, that's enough

It kills me as I lay awake at night
Remembering the last kiss that we shared doesn't feel right
Is it impossible for me to win this fight?
Keep you a little longer in my life

Chorus
