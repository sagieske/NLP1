Song:

Holy Father, love me still
I have fallen from Your will
I am broken
Hear my humble cry
My cry

I have wandered for so long
Tired and weary on my own
In Your arms I know I'm home, O God
My God

Take my life and make it Yours, Lord
Fill me with Your love
You are all I need
I surrender all of me

Take my life and make it Yours, Lord
Fill me with Your love
You are all I need
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender all of me
