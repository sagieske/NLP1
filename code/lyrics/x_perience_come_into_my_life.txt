Song:

Come into my life
(Chorus:)
Come into my life again
I will get back to you and then
You can take me right
Come into my life my love
I know I cannot get enough
Enough of you tonight
Oh, come into my life
Oh, baby hold me tight
Come into my life my love
I know I cannot get enough of you
Come into my life again
I wanna see you, love you, feel you
When were getting old the time goes by
It aint to late before we die
We gonna leave the bad times
And we gonna leave everything behind again
You know, you re always on my mind
We gonna leave everything behind
(Chorus 1x)
You came like a thief at night
You broke the door and took me right
Now I pack my bangs and go
To hunt you, somewhere else, I know
We gonna leave the bad times and
We gonna leave everything behind again
You know, you re always on my mind
We gonna leave everything behind
Come into my life
Come into my life
(Chorus 1x)
Come into my life
Come into my life
Come into my life
