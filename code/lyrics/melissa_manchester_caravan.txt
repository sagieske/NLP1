Caravan
[Manchester]

A bunch of weary voices
I mistook for angels
Telling me what to do with my life
Leaving me no choices
Putting me through changes
Telling me what to do with my life
Oh
I'm sure I won't be back for more
Oh
I am in search of you
My caravan
I will bring my red beads
You will bring what you need
Riding through this journey
On this night
Time to free the gypsy
Time for you to see me
Riding through this journey
On this night
Time to free the gypsy
Time for you to see me
Riding from the darkness
To the light
Oh
I'm sure I won't be back for more
Oh
I am in search of you
My caravan
Oh
I'm sure I won't be back for more, no
Oh
I am in search of you
My caravan
Oh my life's begun
Oh my time has come
It's come
It's come
It's come
I can feel it come
I can see it grow
I found my caravan
Oh
I'm sure I won't be back for more
Oh
I am in search of you
My caravan
Oh
I'm sure I won't be back for more, no
Oh
I am in search of you
My caravan
