Song:

Everybody tells me that you're pretty
And I always try to disagree, ohh
To see you with another guy
Would tear me up deep inside
Cuz they don't know you once belonged to me
Ohh oh

Chorus:
& I know it would be awkward running into you that way
It was okay 'til you said that word to me
Oh no you didn't just call me friend
Oh no I must be hearing things
You can call me wrong
You can call me right
But don't you call me friend tonight
Oh no you didn't just say we're through
Oh no I aint never gettin over you
Tell me that I'm crazy chasing you again
Oh ohh, but don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend

I aint gonna lie
You look so happy
Wish there was something I could still make you feel
Every smile makes me wanna fall apart
Every laugh is like a bullet to my heart
Cuz I'm at the end of the room
Watching every guy coming at you

& I know it would be awkward running into you that way
It was okay 'til you said that word to me
Oh no you didn't just call me friend
Oh no I must be hearing things
You can call me wrong
You can call me right
But don't you call me friend tonight
Oh no you didn't just say we're through
Oh no I aint never gettin over you
Tell me that I'm crazy chasing you again
Oh ohh, but don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend

A friend don't think about you when he's dreaming
Or every single minute that he's breathing
So why is this so hard to believe
A friend wont do it all to try to please you
A friend can never kiss you when he sees you
& you know I wont so just please don't call me friend

Oh no you didn't just call me friend
Oh no I must be hearing things
You can call me wrong
You can call me right
But don't you call me friend tonight
Oh no you didn't just say we're through
Oh no I aint never gettin over you
Tell me that I'm crazy chasing you again
Oh ohh, but don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend
Don't you call me
Don't you, don't you call me
Don't you call me
Don't you call me friend
