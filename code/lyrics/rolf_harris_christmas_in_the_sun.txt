Song:

Christmas in the sun
Come on down and join us for a Christmas in the sun
Shaded by the jackeranda trees
Your picnic lunch is ready any time you please
Or spread yourself a towel on the sand
And let the world go by

Christmas in the sun
Come on down and join us for a Christmas in the sun
Underneath the summer sun

Crazy summer days
In the heat the treetop shimmer through the haze
The kids are splashing water in the shade
Or grabbing chucks of ice and cooling lemonade
And Dad's got a cold one from the fridge
To help him brave the Barbeque

Christmas in the sun
Come on down and join us for a Christmas in the sun
Underneath the sky of blue

As a kid I dreamed of...
Icicles - icicles
Jingle bells - Jingle bells
Santa in his sleigh dashing by
Jack Frost nipping gently at my nose
And snow flakes drifting from the sky
Then I'd wake and find it was...

Christmas in the sun
Come on down and join us for a Christmas in the sun
Underneath the summer sky

Christmas in the sun
Come on down and join us for a Christmas in the sun

And even though my childhood seems a billion dreams awaaay

I can see it still
And I always will

And I still have that sunshine in my heart every Christmas day

It can move me still
And it always will
I wish you all you that sunshine in your heart

Every single day

Yeah what are you going to get me for Christmas lads?

Whatever you want

What did you have in mind?

Whatever you like
