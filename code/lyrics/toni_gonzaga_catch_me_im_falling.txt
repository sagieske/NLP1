Song:

I don't know why
But when I look in your eyes
I felt something that seems so right
You've got yours I've got mine
I think I'm losing my mind
'Cause I shouldn't feel this way

Catch me, I'm falling for you
And I don't know what to do

How can something so wrong
Feel so right all along
Catch me, I'm falling for you
How can time be so wrong?
For love to come along
Catch me, I'm falling for you

How can love let it go
When it has no place to go
And I can't go along pretending
that love is in here to stay
catch me im falling for you

If I could just walk away
Without you from day to day
I would die just thinking of you
I think that we'll never be
More than friends, you and me
But why do I feel this way

Catch me, I'm falling for you
And I don't know what to do

How can something so wrong
Feel so right all along
Catch me, I'm falling for you
How can time be so wrong?
For love to come along
Catch me, I'm falling for you

Maybe someday I'll see
Why love did this to me
'Cause I can't go along,pretending
That love is in here to stay
Catch me, I'm falling for you
Catch me, I'm falling for you

And is it wrong for me to feel this way
'Cause I don't know what to do without you
I'M FALLING FOR YOU
Catch me, I'm falling for you

How can something so wrong
Feel so right all along
Catch me, I'm falling for you
