Song:

Hey hey Baby where did you disappear
Hey hey baby where did you go from here
Did you hear it calling your name
Did you feel it burning in your veins
Hey hey baby where did you go with the rain

I saw a storm in her eyes
A thousand lives
And she danced oh danced oh like a fire

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Angel wings and devil's heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Devil's wings and Angel heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo

Hey hey Baby why do you disappear
Hey hey baby why do you come back here
Did you hear me calling your name
Did you feel me burning in your veins
Hey hey baby why do you go with the rain

I saw a storm in her eyes
A thousand lives
And she danced oh danced oh like a fire

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Angel wings and devil's heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Devil's wings and Angel heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Angel wings and devil's heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo

Wings & Hearts
Two sides of evil
That's what you are
Devil's wings and Angel heart
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo
Voodoo got you
You got the voodoo
Voodoo got you
