Song:

Bloodlust tonight, bite my tongue and hold it in
From deep inside, she aches for every part of him
In the rapture of the midnight Sun
She is longing for immortal love
New moon hangs high, tell me will it ever end?
Oh, oh, oh

Here comes a bad rain
Falling from an aching heart
Here comes a bad rain
Don't know when it's gonna stop

She's somewhere else, should be lying next to me
Under the spell tangled in her ecstasy
From her vein she gave a streaming life
Let him pray on her like a sacrifice
Still she denies everything so brazenly

Oh, oh, oh
Here comes a bad rain
Falling from an aching heart
Here comes a bad rain
Don't know when it's gonna stop

And in the madness of this love
She won't surrender till it's done
And so I'm lost to wait
God, this night could last forever

(Solo)

And so it ends, kisses me and kills the lights
The living dead always leave her satisfied

Here comes a bad rain
Falling from an aching heart
Here comes a bad rain
Don't know when it's gonna stop

Here comes a bad rain
Falling from an aching heart
Here comes a bad rain
Don't know when it's gonna stop
