Song:

Your dream make up is cracked and wearing thin
Your eyes are on your chin
It's getting hard for you
But to make up is only make-believe
And we don't need a scene like this

Whatever happened to the Beautiful Losers
Whatever happened to the Beautiful Losers

Your eyes closed and dreamed of places[Beautiful Losers lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]
That you and I would go
It's getting hard for me
To love you, like I used to
I don't believe "hello"
Do you?

Whatever happened to the Beautiful Losers
Whatever happened to the Beautiful Losers
