Song:

I’m lookin' at the sun You’re lookin' at the moon The different sides of me and you.

I look into your eyes and realize it’s true The feeling’s there, can you see it too? Don’t try to play around, girl.

Just let it happen 'coz I heart you. I-h-e-a-are-t-y-o-you
Believe me, baby it’s the truth I-h-e-a-are-t-y-o-you
Don’t look no further,
I got you My heart is beating fast,
I’m feeling kinda new
And it all started when I first met you
Sometime has passed us
By I hope you got the clue If this was pokemon,
I choose you I can’t escape the feeling,
So I'll let it happen 'coz
I heart you I-h-e-a-are-t-y-o-you
Believe me baby it’s the truth I-h-e-a-are-t-y-o-you Don’t look no futher I Got You..
