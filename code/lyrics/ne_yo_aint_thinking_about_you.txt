Song:

Not gone let it stress me no more

I wont put up wit you and yo drama
No not tonight
(no not tonight I aint thinkin bout ya)
Your insecurities aint gonna stop me
No not tonight
(I'm gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)
I did everything that you wanted me to
I was everything that you wanted me to
Floss up in the street
Representin you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No still not enough so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)

No ohooohohohooohoh
I wont play myself no more
Said I wont worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)

You fuss at me cause yo girl think I'm flyy
(just how the hell can you say that's my fault)
But if they're undressin me
(wont you tell yo girls to check they eyes)
Starin at yo guy
I was everything that you wanted me to
I did everything that you wanted me to
Floss up in the street representin you
All your fantasies in the bedroom
No still not enough so I have had enough
I'm gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, ainy thinkin about you)

No ohooohohohooohoh
I wont play myself no more
Said I wont worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)

Go on and fresh fit and gas up the whip
And get where imma get tonight
Said I tried my best to be your best
And now I'm stressed out
Pop a bottle or two wit you and my crew
Aint thinkin bout you tonight
Stress somebody else
I am gonna enjoy myself tonight

No ohooohohohooohoh
Said I wont play myself no more
Said I wont worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)

No ohooohohohooohoh
I wont play myself no more
Said I wont worry myself
Really don't want to deal with this oh
Not gonna let it stress me no more
Gonna get up, get out, aint thinkin about you
(get up, get out, aint thinkin about you)
