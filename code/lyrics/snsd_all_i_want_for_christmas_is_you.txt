Song:

[Tiffany] I don’t want a lot for Christmas,
There is just one thing I need
I don’t care about the presents,
Underneath the Christmas tree
[Taeyeon] I just want you for my own,
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true,
All I want for Christmas… is… you

[Sunny] I don’t want a lot for Christmas,
There is just one thing I need
[Sooyoung] I don’t care about the presents,
Underneath the Christmas tree
[Yuri] I don’t need to hang my stocking,
There upon the fireplace
[Seohyun] Santa Claus won’t make me happy,
With a toy on Christmas day
[Jessica] I just want you for my own,
More than you could ever know
[Jessica/Yuri/Seohyun] Make my wish come true,
All I want for Christmas is You (You baby)

[Yoona] I won’t ask for much this Christmas,
I don’t even wish for snow
[Sooyoung] I’m just gonna keep on waiting,
Underneath the mistletoe
[Hyoyeon] I won’t make a list and send it,
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
[Tiffany] I won’t even stay awake to,
Hear those magic reindeers click
[Yuri] I just want you for my own,
More than you could ever know
[All] Make my wish come true, all I want for Christmas is you
([Jessica] You baby, oh~)

[Jessica] All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
[Sunny] And the sound of children’s laughter fills the air
[Seohyun] And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
[Taeyeon] Santa won’t you bring me the one I really need
Won’t you please bring my baby to me, oh

[All] Oh I don’t want a lot for Christmas, this is all I’m asking for
I just want to see my baby, standing right outside my door
Cuz I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know
Make my wish come true, [Jessica/Seohyun] all I want for Christmas… is…
[Seohyun] You~

[All] All I want for Christmas ([Taeyeon] And you, and you)
All I want for Christmas
[Taeyeon] All I want for Christmas ([Seohyun] Christmas)
