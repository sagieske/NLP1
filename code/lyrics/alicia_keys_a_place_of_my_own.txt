Song:

When your aims applause, life can be so lonely,
But the faith of the star, makes the way less heavy,
This life can seem so unfair but who care,
If I can rise up then I will get here
Chorus:
Cause I'm lookin my own place to come on,
Lookin for a house to make a home,
Lookin for seats upon a rome,
Lookin for a place to call my own

Hey, hey
What is place to go
Is where I've never gone before,
It takes a place where you saw,
But it makes you much stronger.

Now I feel so alive and there's no more cry,
I chose to rise up and there's no deny

[Chorus:]
Cuz I'm lookin my own place to come on,
Lookin for a house to make a home,
Lookin for seats upon a rome,
But now I have a place to call my own

So many people they tryna make your,
Make you believe it,
And nothing without them go,
Don't you believe it,
Not for a minute you gonna show love,
This is the way

[Chorus:]
Now I got a place, to call my own
Now I got a house to make a home,
Now have the seats upon a rome,
'Cause I have a place to call my own.

Hey, hey
I did it finally... Bout a thing...

Hey, hey
I'll never worry bout a thing
Come on...
