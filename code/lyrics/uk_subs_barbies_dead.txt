Song:

Barbie wore black, black hat
Barbie wore gloves, warm gloves
Barbie was thin, white skin
Barbie's in bed, she's dead

Bellboy cries for Barbie
Mailman cries for Barbie
Gasman cries for Barbie
Said come on let's get drunk

Barbie had a gun, field gun
Barbie had a bird, blackbird
Barbie had a car, Jaguar
Barbie was rich, rich bitch

Boys they cry for Barbie
Girls they cry for Barbie
Daddy cries for Barbie
Then they all got drunk

Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead

When Barbie was alive, so alive
Barbie did sing, sweet things
Barbie had pink hair, spiked hair
Barbie loved rock, punk rock

Boys danced with Barbie
Girls played with Barbie
Daddy he loved Barbie
And the whole party got drunk

Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead
Barbie's dead
