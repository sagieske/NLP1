Song:

Fall on me

So you're down there
Confused you can't bear
When things aren't easy
Hiding is not the answer

Anxiety
Then faithless you'll be
Hope
Just fall on me

There's no other answer
I'll catch you
Just fall on me

Hear me now
Hear my voice
Speaking the words of love
Betrayed and died
How lucky you are
Just open your eyes and see

Anxiety
Then faithless you'll be
Hope
Just fall on me

There's nobody out there
I'll catch you
No other answer
I'll catch you
Just fall on me

I'm tired
Free me
Pick me up from this mess I made
Hear me
Reach me by the hand
And lift me

There's nobody out there
I'll catch you
No other answer
I'll catch you

Just

Fall on me
