Song:

I'm
Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl
I'm
Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl

I don't see nothing but pain and misery,
Cause you are the one for me
Why can't it all be true?
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie?
Why can't it all be true?
Why can't it all be true?
Can't it all be true...

I'm
Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl
I'm
Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl

Suddenly, I believe you are the one for me
Graciously you move through my closed hearts artery
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie?
Why can't it all be true?
Why can't it all be true?

Suddenly, I believe you are the one for me
Graciously you move through my closed hearts artery
Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie?
Why can't it all be true?
Why can't it all be true?

Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl
Wishin' and wishin' away at you girl...
