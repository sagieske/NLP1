Song:

You put my picture in a frame
Ten thousand voices call my name
You were standing here all alone
Painting pictures of a life you call your own
You would never see the light in your way.
We have the cash but not the time.
You have the words but not the rhyme
If I told you all the right things to say
Would you find the strength to shout it loud everyday?
'Cause a whisper don't get heard anymore....
I know there'll be people crying,justifying
If ever I fall from grace
Watching the walls come down a new king's crowned
If ever I fall from grace
And I know there'll be people singing,church bell ringing
If ever I fall from grace
Gone but it won't take long
The world goes on
If ever I fall from grace...
He's got that look upon his face
Eyes closed and running with the race
You don't understand the meaning of truth
When you look into a mirror and it's not you
WHat does anybody know anymore?
I know there'll be people crying,justifying
If ever I fall from grace
Watching the walls come down a new king's crowned
If ever I fall from grace
And I know there'll be people singing,church bell ringing
If ever I fall from grace
Gone but it won't take long
The world goes on
If ever I fall from grace...
Just as the climbing's easy
The falling down gets hard
Finding the place you're after
Still it seems so far...
