Song:

Only that I see, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of
Something I can never be
It doesn't matter to me, 'cause I will always be that pimp that I see
In all of my fantasies

I don't know your f*****g name
So what? Let's...

Screamin' to be the only way that I can truly be free
From my f****d up reality
So I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause it's so fun to see
My face staring back at me

I don't know your f*****g name
So what? Let's f**k

All day I dream about s**
All day I dream about fu***n'

All day I dream about fu***n'

All day I dream about s**
Yes, all day I dream about s**
And all day I dream about s**
Yes, all day I dream about s**
And all day I dream about s**
Yes, all day I dream about s**
And all day I dream about s**
Yes, all day I dream about s**

All day I dream about s**
All day I dream about fu***n'
All day I dream about s**
All day I dream about fu***n'
