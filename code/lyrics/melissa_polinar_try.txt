Song:

There's something about you
The way you move, the way you look at me

There's something about the way you see things
It's like a change of scenery

Everything about you I just want more of
But don't get any closer
If this will last a little longer
There's a chance I'll find myself saying

There's nothing, nothing I can do
To keep my heart away from you
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

To get you off my mind
To help me move on and just live my life
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

Cause whenever you're near, it's love that I fear
I've been in this shell
And I can't tell if I'm living at all
I've been doing well on my own
But maybe it's just me who I'm deceiving

Cause everything about me leads right to you

Oh, I want to get closer
But let me doubt a little longer
Till I'll turn it over and give in

Cause there's nothing, nothing I can do
To keep my heart away from you
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

To get you off my mind
To help me move on and just live my life
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

Cause whenever you're near
It's love that I fear
Of falling so helplessly
Fear of losing, losing control

There's nothing, nothing I can do
To keep my heart away from you
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

To get you off my mind
To help me move on and just live my life
I can't help it, I can't tell you how much I try

Cause whenever you're near it's love that I fear
