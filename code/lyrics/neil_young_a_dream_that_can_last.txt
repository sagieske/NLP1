Song:

I feel like I died and went to Heaven
The cupboards are bare
But the streets are paved with gold

I saw a young girl who didn't die
I saw a glimmer from in her eye
I saw the distance, I saw the past
And I know I won't awaken, it's a dream that can last

I feel like I died and went to Heaven
The cupboards are bare
But the streets are paved with gold

And all the lights were turned down low
And no one wondered or had to go
Out on the corner the angels say
There is a better life for me someday

I feel like I died and went to Heaven
The cupboards are bare
But the streets are paved with gold
