Made a wrong turn
Once or twice
Dug my way out
Blood and fire
Bad decisions
That's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated
Misplaced, misunderstood
Miss no way it's all good
It didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

[Refrain]

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself
You were wrong
Change the voices
In your head
Make them like you instead

So complicated
Look happy you'll make it
Feel with so much hatred
Such a tired game
It's enough
I've done all I can think of
Chase down all my demons
I've seen you do the same (Oh)

[Refrain]

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

[Bridge]
The whole world's scared
So I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking
Is an ice cold beer
So cool in line
And we try try try
But we try too hard
And it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics
'Cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans
They don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves
And we do it all the time

Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah... 
Oh... 
Oh pretty, pretty please... 

[Refrain]

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than
Fuckin' perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

Yeah... You're perfect, you're perfect... 
Oh... 

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me
