Song:

I've seen a fire start in Frisco
The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a-blazing
Throwing up in flames

I heard men, women and children
Crying out to their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen
So they were burned alive

They went down, down, deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in New York
In the year two thousand and one
I've seen steel birds falling down in great fire

I've seen so many wars
I've seen men send rockets out into space
I foresee a holocaust
An angel of death descending to destroy the human race

Down, down, deep undergound
A great disaster



In the sixteenth century there was a French philosopher
By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesised that in the late twentieth century
An angel of death shall waste this land

A holocaust the likes of which
This planet had never seen
Now, I ask you
Do you believe this to be true?

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, "Have mercy, mercy!"

His body was riddled with a disease
Unknown to man so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

He went down, down, deep underground
A great disaster

You'll go down, down, deep underground
A great disaster
