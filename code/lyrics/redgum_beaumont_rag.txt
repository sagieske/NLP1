Song:

I am a wealthy barrister
About 100 bucks a word
I've got a plum stuck in my mouth
I'm really such a
Really such a turd

I attended pac
I meet a wife at the prefects' ball
I am the elder fotheringay
And she was apprentice,
She was apprentice w***e

I passed my matriculation
Four Ds and a C
Daddy bought be a Mercedes Benz
And he bought me a law de'
Bought me a law degree

I voted for Mal Fraser
Was the decent thing to do
Was a vote against the communists
And I hope that you did,
Hope that you did too

I love to read the bulletin and watch the abc
I love to wear by well-informed opinions constantly
All my friends are professionals from polite society
So come and sing the middle class Liberal
I've got a home in Beaumont Rag with me

I bought a brand new Range Rover
The outback is a lark
I slip it into four-wheel drive
At gates of national
Gates of national park

Oh the working class are out of place
When they are on strike
I drive my Jag in circles
Trying to knock them off their,
Knock them off their bikes

I love to read the bulletin and watch the abc
I love to wear by well-informed opinions constantly
All my friends are professionals from polite society
So come and sing the middle class Liberal
I've got a home in Beaumont Rag with
Come and sing the middle class Liberal
I've got a home in Beaumont Rag with me
