Song:

My mother works so hard
She works so late
Oh mother, take it easy
You work so hard
You might be late
To your own party

When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair
It's not fair

Hit you with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
And I'm going to kill you
If you dare to
Hit me with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
Etcetera, whatever
Oh my father

Father, I love you so
I love you so
I've got parts of your body
I love you so
You're never late
To your own party

When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair
When you leave me it's not fair

Don't give me more than I want
Don't give me more than I want
Don't give me more than I want
I will just take what I've got
Don't give me what you want

Mother, I love you so
I love you so
I've got parts of your father, and Dorrigo
Now I know that if I had a brother
He would know
He would know
But all I've got's a sister
She lives below
She lives below
She lives below your home

How I love you

Hit you with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
And I'm going to kill you
If you dare to
Hit me with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
Better late than never
Your own party

Hit me with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
Better late than never
Your own party

Hit me with a feather
Miss you by a whisker
Better late than never
Your own party
