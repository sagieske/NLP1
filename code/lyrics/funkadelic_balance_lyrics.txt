Song:

Balance is my thing
The sun don't
Snow, wind and rain
Most times
(x2)
Mother
I can see it, I can hear it
But I don't know where it's coming from
Mother
Are you sure this is the time in which we belong
Hey, mother
Don't be angry, don't be jealous
And don't forget who is to blame
Mother
It was you, it was not me who
Created this conflicting brain
Ohhhhhhhhh
Whoooaaaaaa
Balance is my thing
The sun don't
Snow, wind and rain
Most times
Hey, mother
I can feel it, I can taste it
I can smell what it's all about
Hey, mother
I know it's in me, all about me
But my instinct won't let it out
Hey, mother
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm high
Sometimes I am really down
Hey, mother
What's in your plans, what's in your game
What secrets can be found
Balance is my thing
The sun don't
Snow, wind and rain
Most times
Hey mother
What do you mean, "Don't take it personal"
C?
Hey mother
Am I to sit here when my brother is down
Yes, mother
I can see it, I can hear it
But I don't know where it's coming from
Hey mother
Are you sure this is the time where we belong
Balance is my thing
The sun don't
(x13)
