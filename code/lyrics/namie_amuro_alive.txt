Song:

Shadows on the moon
Mirror on my heart
Shattered broken glass
Cut my world apart
Rescue me my lover
Kiss me back to life
Save me when the sun goes down
Cause I'm lonely tonight

I need you loving me
I need you loving me
I need you loving me
To make me feel alive

Colour in the grey
See the night burn through
Lying here awake
Waiting up for you
Rescue me my lover
Kiss me back to life
Save me when the sun goes down
Cause I'm lonely tonight

I need you loving me
I need you loving me
I need you loving me
To make me feel alive

Shadows on the moon
Mirror on my heart
Shattered broken glass
Cut my world apart

I need you loving me
I need you loving me
I need you loving me
To make me feel alive
