Song:

You ask me
If there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder
If this heart of mine
Will lose
It's desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes
You think love will end
When you know
That my whole life depends
On you
(On you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear
I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you
Think love will end
When I've asked you
To spend your whole life
With me
(With me, with me)

You ask me
If there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love (12x)
Never (3x)
