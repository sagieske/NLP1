Song:

I'm down to my last
Stick of cigarette
I'm down to the last thought
In my head

You saw me
Packing my bags
You asked me
If I was coming back
And I told you
That I wasn't sure
And I'm
5 steps away from out the door

Darlin' it ain't easy
For me to say goodbye
But I have found myself another guy

You look confused
And I don't blame you
But you're never around
Enough for me to love you
Me to love you

Darlin' you don't deserve me
You don't deserve my love
I had plenty to give
But you shrugged it off

Don't think I don't know
About the hair on the pillow
And it seems like what we had was just a show
Was it all
Just a show?

Darlin' it aint easy
For us to say goodbye
I just hope that we'll have better lives
