Song:

You count 'em, one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad (get that mad)
You drain the life from me
And it feels oh, so good

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in (wasting time)
Just let me in
Let's make it right

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down and get down
Let's make it happen all night

You're moving close (you're moving close)
My pulse is racing
We're getting close
Yeah, I can taste it
I've never done it quite like this
So slow it down now
Just slow it down

The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in (wasting time)
Just let me in
Let's make it right

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down and get down
Let's make it happen all night

You count 'em, one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me
And it feels oh, so good

You count 'em, one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me
And it feels oh, so good

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down and get down
Let's make it happen all night

So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time (wasting time)
So get down and get down
Let's make it happen all night
