Song:

You are always in my heart
Even though you're far away
I can hear the music of
The song of love
I sang with you
You are always in my heart
And when skies above are grey
I remember that you care
And then and there
The sun breaks through

Just before I go to sleep
There's a rendezvous I keep
And a dream I always meet
Helps me forget were far apart
I don't know exactly when, dear,
But I'm sure well meet again, dear,
And my darling, till we do
You are always in my heart!
