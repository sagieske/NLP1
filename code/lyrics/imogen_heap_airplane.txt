Song:

Drifting though the atmosphere
And up into space
Leave behind the moon he's sitting
In his special place

Some flutterbies they enter and they
Play around in my soul
And once again part of me
Fills up to be whole

Da da day
Just flying in my airplane.

Peaceful colours everywhere
Purples and deep blues
Feeling so at home here oh
As if up here I grew

It's so beautiful up here now,
Oh I think I might just stay
All alone and by myself
So free and far away

Da da day
I'm with my aeroplane

I can see heaven
Heaven down below
I look at heaven
And an angel who I know
I can see heaven
Heaven down below

Da da day
I'm with my aeroplane

Just happy to be me again.
