Song:

Billy club wears a uniform, his dream job's to be a cop
His hero was G.I. Joe, loved to change his clothes
Boy Scout blues to screw banaroos to code of silence
Hand of the law has got control guilty of innocence
I'm a compund fracture from the north of ontario
I'm a no taught mannered product of my own
That dunce in the corner said wants to be a cop
Caught me smokin' in the toilet stall
Said I'll get you when I grow up Billy Club was on his beat
Noticed in my hand a drink remembers his childhood
Knows that he got me good Billy Club has got his gun it's out
Says to make a move I said," Billy when you gonna
Get over something to prove?"
