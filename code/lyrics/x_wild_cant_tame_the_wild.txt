Song:

(First rule of engagement: know your enemy.
See the fear feed on the lust of the eyes. Know,
That this is your night, the night of the dead.
Wait, I see a victim - here he comes, into my arms.)

Back in the night, looking for a fight
Whisky's a-burning in my head
Gotta get some more,
This night, I gotta get some pain
You'll get a knife in the back
An alleyway attack
Sleeping with the rats another day
You're barely alive, I see the fear in your eyes

(Come to me and see the happiness I bring.
You will not be afraid.)

Here comes the man - blood on his hands
Power is rushing in my veins
Nothing to say, you know you're gonna have to pay
I am the cat with nine lives, don't be surprised
Fortune is coming my way
Just give me the cash and then i'll send you away

(And you know I lie. Place your body on the knife.
Come there will be no pain for you or I.)

You say, we say, I say, you can't tame the wild
You say, we say, I say, you can't tame the wild

Back in the night, kickin' for a fight
Thunder is always in my brain
Come back for more
Today I'm giving you the pain
He got a knife in the back, an alleyway attack
Sleeping with the rats another day
He's barely alive, I kiss the fear in his eyes

(Come and see the glint of the knife. You will be amazed, blood drips)
