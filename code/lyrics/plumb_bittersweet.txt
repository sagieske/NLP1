Song:

I've been carrying this old luggage
And I'ts been really bugging me
So when you called to see me
I couldn't believe it
Could it really be?

You need to feel forgiveness
I need to feel resentment
Running down the drain
This bruising chain I've carried
Is the pain that I am burying today

[Chorus:]
Now I can breath
And I feel grace brush over me
It pours through my skin
And lets you in
And we are free
Now I can breath
And I feel grace brush over me
It runs through my veins
And what I taste is bitter sweet

The clock is always ticking
Bitterness grows by the minute
Why can't we realize
The wounds that we're inflicting
On our own flesh it isn't healing
By keeping love inside (Yeah)

[Chorus:]

Now I can breath
And I feel grace brush over me
It pours through my skin
And lets you in
And we are free
Now I can breath
And I feel grace brush over me
It runs through my vains
And what I taste is bitter sweet
Bitter sweet
