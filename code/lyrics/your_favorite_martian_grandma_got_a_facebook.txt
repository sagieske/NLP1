Song:

Grandma's got a Facebook, now she's hitting on my friends.
Don't care how it started, but now it's got to end.
Help me stay connected to my uncles and my aunts,
But I also know she's been in my best friend's pants.

Grandma, Grandma [x4]
Gr-Gr-Grandma Grandma
Grandma, Grandma [x3]

Well, ever since grandpa passed away, she's been chilling at home.
Watching soaps half the day 'cause she's feeling alone.
So, I set her up a Facebook and gave the address.
To my friends and I asked them all to send a request.
And no one would have guessed one day she'd go wild,
But grandma got obsessed and changed her profile to slutty Mcbuttsex
And I was appalled when I saw a bunch of pictures of her cleavage on her
Wall.

Grandma's got a Facebook, now she's hitting on my friends.
Don't care how it started, but now it's got to end.
Help me stay connected to my uncles and my aunts,
But I also know she's been in my best friend's pants.

Then she updated her status yeah, and it made me pissed
Cause she said her grandson was a crybaby b***h!
And all my stupid friends wrote her back and they laughed.
And they all liked her comment cause they're wack and I'm mad.
Is this considered abuse, yeah you'd be pissed at her too
Cause now her list to do's is just pictures of dudes.
I wanted her to make friends but she's about to seduce.
My homeboys with a mixture of vodka and prune juice.

Grandma's got a Facebook, now she's hitting on my friends.
Don't care how it started, but now it's got to end.
Help me stay connected to my uncles and my aunts,
But I also know she's been in my best friend's pants.

I checked my Facebook daily.
I get a friend request from this old a** lady.
I know it's your grandma, but I ain't gonna lie.
She's rocking that muu muu, and looking all fly.
I want to smack your grandma on her wrinkly a**
Wrinkly a**, wrinkly a**!
I want to smack your grandma on her wrinkly a**
Wrinkly a**, wrinkly a**!

Butterscotch my balls
Me and your grandma sharing a sponge bath
I want to put my hands in your grandma's candy dish.

Grandma's got a Facebook, now she's hitting on my friends.
Don't care how it started, but now it's got to end.
Help me stay connected to my uncles and my aunts,
But I also know she's been in my best friend's pants.
