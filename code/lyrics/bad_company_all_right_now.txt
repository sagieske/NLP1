Song:

Whoa-oh-oh-woah-ahh

There she stood in the street
Smilin' from her head to her feet;

I said, "Hey, what is this?
Now baby, maybe,
Maybe she's in need of a kiss. "

I said, "Hey, what's your name?
Maybe we can see things the same. "

"Now don't you wait, or hesitate
Let's move before they raise the parking rate. "

Ohh
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now.
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now.

(Let me tell you now)
I took her home to my place,
Watchin' every move on her face;

She said, "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryna' put me to shame? "

I said "Slow, don't go so fast, don't you think that love can last?"

She said, "Love, Lord above,
Now you're tryna' trick me in love. "

All right now, baby, it's a-all right now.
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now.

Whoo, oh yeah
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now, yeah
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now
All right now, baby, it's a-a-all right now
All right n-now, baby baby baby it's all right
All right now, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right
All right now, baby, it's a-all right now
Yeah, we're so happy together
It's all right, it's all right it's all right
Everything's all right
