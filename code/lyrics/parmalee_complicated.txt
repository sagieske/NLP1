Song:

Oh. Woah. Woah. Yeah.

Thoughts burning through my head.
Silence breaks me down again.
I can't believe it's over and gone.
You put me through the final test,
I found that I was second best.
You gotta leave me alone.
It's over now, on my way back down.
And you know, and you know, and you know,

My heart is aching.
My mind is breaking.
I'm so messed up, I can't breathe at all.
I never really knew you at all.
Complicated.

Take your things
And leave me with my stitched up heart.
This time I've had enough.
This time I've had enough.

My heart is aching.
My mind is breaking.
I'm so messed up, I can't breathe at all.
It's complicated.
I can't explain it.
I'm standing wit my back against the wall.
I never really knew you at all.
I never really knew you at all.

My heart is aching.
My mind is breaking.
I never really knew you at all.
It's complicated.
I can't explain it.
I'm standing with my back against the wall.

My heart is aching.
My mind is breaking.
I'm so messed up I can't breathe at all.
It's complicated.
No, I can't explain it.
It's complicated.
No, I can't explain it.
I can't explain it.
I can't explain it.
I can't explain it.
I never really knew you at all.
