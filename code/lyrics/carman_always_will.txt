Song:

I've been alone and I've been forgotten
I know what it feels like to be on the bottom.
Nothing to look forward to and nobody there.
I've felt the grip of the spirit that takes you
Under the ways of depression that makes you
Numb to the feeling of hope and you just don't care.

And I seek Your will
More and more each day.
But I'm weak and I
Feel I've lost my way.
And I'm hoping I
Will find You through the maze
Of all of my confusion when I pray.

Lord, I need to hear You say
That You're there for me
That You're with me still.
And I need to hear You say
That You care for me,
That You love me and You always will.

I know it's not a one way street
And what I need to hear from You,
You need to hear from me.

Lord, You need to hear me say
That I'm there for You
That I'm with You still
And You need to hear me say
That I care for You
That I love You and I always will
