Song:

I just need a little space to call my own
Just a corner of the world where I can be alone
With you
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
I just need some satisfaction (just me)
Some private interaction (just you)
Some animal attraction (just you)
I just need a little space to call my own
Just a corner of the world where I can be alone
With you
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
I just need some satisfaction (just me)
Some private interaction (just you)
Some animal attraction (just you)
I just need a little space to call my own
Just a corner of the world where I can be alone
With you
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
What do you do when everybody wants you
How do you breathe when they take you in
Who do you turn to when you need to get away
I know only your love can get me there
