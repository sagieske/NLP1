Song:

Yesterday you told me
I was your lover and friend
Now you?re trying
To drive our love to a end
How can I
Survive without you
In my life baby
All I wanna do
Is break down and cry over you

It?s not fair
How you mistreated me
You broke my heart
And suffocated my mind
Wiht your lies
It?s not fair
How you abuse my love
I gave to you baby

I feel like
I had a heart attack Everytime I think
About the love
I gave to you baby
The pain comes right back again
Because you threw away
The love I gave you
And you started to be
So untrue to me

It?s not fair
How you mistreated me
You broke my heart
And suffocated my mind
With your lies
It?s not fair
How you abuse my love
I gave to you baby

So many nights
On the telephone
You would tell me
So many fairytales
And during the day
You sent me many letters
Trying to make me feel better
But where was your love

It?s not fair
How you misteated me
You broke my heart
And suffocated my mind
With your lies
It?s not fair
How you abuse my love
I gave to you baby
