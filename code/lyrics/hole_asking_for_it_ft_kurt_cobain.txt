Song:

Everytime that i sell myself too you
I feel a little bit cheaper than i need too
I will tear the petals off of you
Rose red i will make you tell the truth

Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
She was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice?

Everytime that i stare into the sun
Angel dust and my dress just comes undone
Everytime that i stare into the sun
Be a model or just look like one

Wild eye Rot gut do me in
Do you think you can make me do it again?

Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
She was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice?

If you live through this with me i swear that i would die for you
(Kurt)Live through this i swear that i would die for you
If you live through this with me i swear that i would die for you
(Kurt)Live through this i swear that i would die for you.....

(Kurt)Live through this
Live through this....

Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
She was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice?

Was she asking for it?
Was she asking nice?
She was asking for it,
Did she ask you twice?

And if you.....ahh
And if you.....ahh
And if you.....ahh.....
And if you.....Live.....
