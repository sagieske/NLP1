Song:

ERIKA:
Once a lass met a lad
You're a gentle one, said she
In my heart I'd be glad
If you loved me for me

You say your love is true
And I hope that it will be

DOMINICK:
I'd be sure, if I knew
That you loved me for me

ERIKA:
Could I be the one you're seeking?
Will I be the one you choose? Can you tell my heart is speaking?
My eyes will give you clues

DOMINICK:
What you see may be deceiving
Truth lies underneath the skin

ERIKA:
Hope will blossum by believing

BOTH:
The heart that lies within

DOMINICK:
I'll be yours
Together we shall always be as one
If you love me for me

DOMINICK // ERIKA:
I'll be yours! // Who can say where we'll go, 
Together we shall always // Who can promise that we'll be
Be as one // But I'll stay by your side

BOTH:
If you love me for me
If you love me for me
