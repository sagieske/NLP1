Song:

Because you’re mine
The brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me
Because you’re mine, because you’re mine

Because you’re mine
The breeze that hurries by
Becomes a melody and why?
Because you’re mine, because you’re mine

I only know for as long as I may live
I’ll only live for the kiss
That you alone may give me

And when we kiss
That isn’t thunder, dear
It’s only my poor heart you hear
And it’s applause, because you’re mine

Because you’re mine
The brightest star I see looks down
My love, and envies me
Because you’re mine, because you’re mine

Because you’re mine
The breeze that hurries by
Becomes a melody and why?
Because you’re mine, because you’re mine

I only know for as long as I may live
I’ll only live for the kiss
That you alone may give me

And when we kiss
That isn’t thunder, dear
It’s only my poor heart you hear
And it’s applause, because you’re mine

Because you’re mine
