Song:

Toddler Anna: Elsa? (knocks)
Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door, 
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you want to build a snowman?
It doesn't have to be a Snowman

Young Elsa: Go away, Anna

Toddler Anna: Okay, bye

Young Anna: (knocks)
Do you want to build a snowman
Or ride our bike around the halls?
I think some company is overdue
I've started talking to
The pictures on the walls
(Hang in there, Joan! )
It gets a little lonely, 
All these empty rooms, 
Just watching the hours tick by
(Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock)

Anna: (knocks) Elsa?
Please I know you're in there, 
People are asking where you've been, 
They say "have courage"; 
And I'm trying to, 
I'm right out here for you
Just let me in
We only have each other
It's just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you want to build a snowman? (sniff)
