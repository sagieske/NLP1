Song:

There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her
And her friends think he's fit
And you just can't measure up no, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her, when she was there

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus:]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah but I know you were though

Now you don't know what she's up to
You can only assume
If she's not out front of the shop's then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone round in her school stuff
Bet that's what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

But she's not nice she's pretty f*****g far from nice
She's looking at ya funny rarely looking at ya twice

[Chorus:]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh you're better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah but it's clear you were though

You hear what she has been doing, never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at 20 past 3
She's been with all of the boys but never went very far
And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car

They've got engaged there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in oh
Now the girls have grown yeah but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

[Chorus:]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah but I'm only pretending you know (x2)
Yeah I'm only pretending you know
I was only pretending you know (x2)
