Song:

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away,
Run away from here

I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow point smile
Me and your runaway scars,
Got a photograph dream on the getaway mile.

Let's blow a hole in this town
To much talking with a laser blade
Gunnin' out of this place
In a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again.

How can they say, Jenny could you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back, let me be the one to save you.

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be.
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
When we would run away,
When we could run away, run away from here.

I'm shootin' out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there
'Cause I really don't care
And I'll do it again.

So get me out of my head.
'Cause it's getting kind of cramped, you know.
Coming ready or not
When the motor gets hot
We can do it again.

The papers say, Johnny won't you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't want to give yourself up
Tell the truth and God will save you

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
If we could run away, run away from here.

And though I know how much you hate this
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?

Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fail and leave you stranded
I ain't gonna be the one left standing
You ain't gonna be the one left standing
We ain't gonna be the ones left standing

Gravity don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny?
This world is after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away,
Run away from here.
Yeah, away from here.
Away from here.
