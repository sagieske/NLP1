Song:

The death throes of your final benediction echoes
Down the spiral of the world's spine
Down upon your great army behind the burning lake
The fiery last days of your reign on earth
Your falseness is your pity pride
Your cowardliness is your whole life
My blood is the way of your future
My army of pureness will crush your idols
Age of empire total war
Paradise lies in the shadow of my sword
Have I been understood?
