Song:

Bama lama bama loo
Got a girl named Lucinder, we call her the great pretender,
Got a girl named Lucinder, we call her the great pretender,
And when she talks, she says bama lama loo.

Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo,
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo,
Now I dig her style, she's like a drive me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo.

I asked my baby for kiss, she shook her head like this,
I asked my little girl for kiss, she shook her head around like this,
She said woooo-oh, yeah.

Bama lama, bama loo, ...
Now I dig that style, it's drivin' me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo.

I asked my baby for kiss, ...

Bama lama, bama loo, ...
Now I dig that style, now I'm drivin' her wild with
Bama lama, bama loo.
