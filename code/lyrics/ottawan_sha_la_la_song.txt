Song:

Sha la la la la oh oh oh

Sha la la la la oh oh oh
.. .
How we loved that sha la la song
We used to sing all summer long
When we were young.

Sha la la la la oh oh oh

Sha la la la la oh oh oh.
That was long ago
Oh oh oh
When I hear it now
Oh oh oh
It still turns me on just the same

It still lights me up like a flame
Each time again.
Remember we were so happy

Blue skies were never so blue.
We were so happy
And every wish that we made came true.
Remember we were in heaven

No love was ever so right

We were in heaven
And when we kissed. It was dynamite.
Sha la la la la oh oh oh
