Song:

I even loved the ground that you walked on
But that has been some time ago
I could never take you back, no matter how I try
For all the love I had is gone

You told me a lie and I believed you
That's alright if that's the way you want to do
Go on my dear now with your new love
You'll know how it feels when he lies to you
