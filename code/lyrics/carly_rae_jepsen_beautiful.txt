Song:

You're not trying to be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Fill the words that I don't say
I wish somehow, I could say them now
Oh, oh, I could say them now, yeah

Just friends, the beginning of the end
How do we make sense
From we're going our own
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, I should've known
Nothing in the world compares to the feelings that we share
So not fair
What makes you so beautiful, is you don't know how beautiful you are to me

You're not trying to be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Fill the words that I don't say
I wish somehow, I could say them now
