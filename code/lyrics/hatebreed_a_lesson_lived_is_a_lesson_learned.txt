Song:

A Lesson Lived Is A Lesson Learned Do it
Some scars are meant to be worn with pride.
Everyday is knowledge to use in life.
A lesson lived is a lesson learned.
Setbacks used to propel me forward
Misjudgment taken as force to do right,
A better outlook a mindset of power.
Each day resolve and reform.
A lesson lived is a lesson learned
You've got to fend for yourself
A lesson lived is a lesson learned
Everyday is a lesson.

Said so many things that I wish I could retract
I've got my issues, I've got my demons
Finished what I began and finally saw.
It's how you use the knowledge you've been given.
Stood tall when others would have turned and run.
Put my work in when everyone quit.
Claw and tear for everything I have.
And I've only just began

A lesson lived is a lesson learned
You've got to fend for yourself
A lesson lived is a lesson learned
Everyday is a lesson
