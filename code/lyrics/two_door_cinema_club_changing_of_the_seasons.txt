Song:

So it's over? I didn't realize
It's so much colder
But it was no surprise

Did you ever
Get to know me?
'Cause it has never been so plain to see

When you say you won't forget me
I can tell you that's not true
'Cause every day since you left me
I've thought less and less of you

And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore

The door is open
You whisper to me
As you stood frozen
Deep on certainty

I hope that you know
What I am thinking
Before you go
With your heart sinking

When you say you won't forget me
Well I can tell you that's not true
'Cause every day since you left me
I've thought less and less of you

And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you anymore
Anymore
Anymore

You say come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night
With me
You say come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night
With me
You say come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night
With me
They say come back and spend the night
Come back and spend the night
With me

When you say you won't forget me
I can tell you that's not true
'Cause every day since you left me
I've thought less and less of you

And I've worn out all the reasons
To keep on knocking at your door
Could be the changing of the seasons
But I don't love you
Anymore
