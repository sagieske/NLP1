Song:

I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Since you left me and you said goodbye
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
All I do is sit and cry
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You went away and left me misery
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
That's the way it'll always be
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You said you loved me and you'd always be mine
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
We'd be together till the end of time
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you say it was just a game
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Well all you're doin' is leavin' me pain
Time goes by it goes so slow, oh yeah
Till you start to see it to
Only just a few days ago
You said you loved me and it made me blue
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Now you're gone and I'm all alone
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
You're still way up there on your throne
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Nothin' seems to ever go right
I'm in pieces, bits and pieces
Night is day and day is night
