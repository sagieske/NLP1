Song:

Was that you dreaming out of control?
Don't get uneasy, no one's ever understood it all
And we will always love you
We'll be so proud of you
We will sing your song tonight

When they call you out
When they ask you who you've been
Will you have a doubt?
Will you tell them with a grin?
I was lost, I was blind, I was you
(I was blind, I was lost, I was you)

All I gave was me
All I gave was me
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la

Under the blue sky, seconds tick away
There's no resolution, it just changes everyday
So shh, we will always love you
We'll be so proud of you
We will sing your song tonight

When they call you out
When they ask you who you've been
Will you have a doubt?
Will you tell them with a grin?
I was lost, I was blind, I was you
(I was lost, I was blind, I was you )

All I gave was me
(All I gave was me)
All I gave was me
(All I gave was me)
I gave you all that I had to give you
I gave you all that I had to give you

Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la

Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
Sha la la la, la la la la la la la
