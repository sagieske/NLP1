==========================
Rolf Harris - Botany Bay
==========================

Farewell to old England forever,
Farewell to you numb-skulls as well.
And farewell to the well-known Old Bailey
Where I always did look such a swell.
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now my crime against the whole British Nation
Was to take some dry bread one fine day,
T'was death, or it was transportation,
So they tossed up a coin and sent me away.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now there's the Captain, he's our commander,
There's the bosun and all of the crew,
There's the first and second class passengers,
Know what we poor convicts go through.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

Now take warning you Dukes and you Duchesses,
Pay close attention to what I say.
Just make sure it's you own what you touchesses,
Or you'll join us in Botany Bay.

Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ay,
Singing too-ra-li oo-ra-li ad-dy,
And I'll see you in Botany Bay.

And I'll see you in Botany Bay.
