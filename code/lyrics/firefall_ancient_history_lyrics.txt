Song:

Throughout the ages, men were lost
They never found themselves
Through different stages never learning
Not to kill themselves

And so they prayed to God way up in the clouds above
They hoped he'd fill their hearts with love

It's ancient history
It's how we got this way
It's really no mystery that we're still the same today

Through sweeping changes, man evolved becoming civilized
Though our emotions, our animal natures
They still ruled our lives

Took what they really wanted, burned what they didn't need
Their hearts were filled with hate and greed

It's ancient history
It's how we got this way
It's ancient history
Funny we're the same today

It's ancient history
It's how we got this way
It's really no mystery that we're still the same today
