Song:

Watch her as she flew, deep within the blue.
A day out from the county, I. C. You.
There's nothing you can do, someone gently says to you:
"The doctor says that now it won't be long."

Try and live up to the moment, and I hope that I don't blow it.
What is in me that she hears?
Its just a song she likes, her little arms around my neck.
And a dying girl whispers in my ear.

Tell me now, can you feel it?
I've been keeping company with ghosts.
She comes to me, like a piece of summer.
She comes to me on days when I need it most.

Well summer dies, and nothing lasts forever.
You're so fine, the way you stand up to your fears.
Summer dies, and it's just moments we have together.
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years,
For you and I.
Oh, Annie.

More to life than trying to survive.
Oh, Annie.

My boyfriend took pictures of me as I held you.
Traveling alone, and the loneliness brings me to tears.
Summer dies, and it's just moments we have together.
I'd give my bones for you to get a few more years,
For you and I.
Oh, Annie.
More to life than trying to survive.
Oh, Annie.

Stronger than the hands that hold you,
You singalong to the song on the radio.
If I drank too much, then I am wreckless.
Just this once, would you forgive this?

Hold on, and days gone by.
Tell me now, can you feel this?
I can't keep this all to myself.
She's elegant, and she means it.
No.

Years, for you and I.
Oh, Annie.
More to life than trying to survive,
Oh, Annie.

Watch her as she flew, deep within the blue.
Watch her as she slips away from you.
I keep fingers crossed always for you.
