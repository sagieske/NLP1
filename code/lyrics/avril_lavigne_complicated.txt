Song:

Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is

Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?
Lay back it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see

I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talking to me one on one
What you've become

Somebody else, round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way, you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honesty and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's all you see
You're making me

Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you've become

Somebody else round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
Trying to be cool you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And You fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into Honesty
And promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no (no no no)

Chill out whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see

Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
And You fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into Honesty
And Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no

Why you have to go and make things so complicated? (yeah yeah)
I see the way you're acting like your somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this you
You fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty
Promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no
