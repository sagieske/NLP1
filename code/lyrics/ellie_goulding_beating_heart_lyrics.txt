Song:

I just made that piece in typical tease
With wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally we stepped to leave to the departure lounge
This belief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
On the white wine bit to sunlight

Want to hear your beating heart tonight
Before that bleeding sun comes to life
I want to make the best of what is left for tight
And hear my beating heart one last time
Before the light

And the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky he looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
And never faded ever green
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
On the white wine bit to sunlight

Want to hear your beating heart tonight
Before that bleeding sun comes to life
I want to make the best of what is left for tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't fake this town
Everything's changed
Eyes are leaving your side
It's hoping we collide
It's hoping we collide
It's hoping we collide

Want to hear your beating heart tonight
Before that bleeding sun comes to life
I want to make the best of what is left for tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Want to hear your beating heart
