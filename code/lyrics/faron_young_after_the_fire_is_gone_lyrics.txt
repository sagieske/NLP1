Song:

Love is where you find it when you find no love at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone

The bottle is almost empty the clock just now struck ten
Darling I had to call you to our favorite place again
We know it's wrong for us to meet but the fire's gone out at home
And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
Love is where you find it...
[ steel ]
Your lips are warm and tender and your arms hold me just right
Sweet words of love you remember that the one at home's forgot
Each time we say it's last time oh but we keep a hanging on
And there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
Love is where you find it...
