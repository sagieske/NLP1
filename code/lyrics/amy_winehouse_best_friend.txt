Song:

I Can't Wait To Get Away From You
Unsuprisingly You Hate Me Too
We Only Communicate When We Need To Fight
But We're Best Friends, Right?

You're Too Good At Pretending You Don't Care
There's Enough Resentment In The Air
Now You Don't Want Me In The Flight
When You're Home At Night
But We're Best Friends, Right?

You're Stephanie And I'm Paulette
You Know What All My Faces Mean
And It's Easy To Smoke It Up, Forget
Everything That's Happened In Between

Nickey's Right When He Says I Can't Win
So I Don't Want To Tell You Anything
I Can't Even Think About How You Feel Inside
But We Are Best Friends, Right?

I Don't Like The Way You Say My Name
You're Always Looking For Someone To Blame
Now You Want Me To Suffer Just Cause You Was Born *White*
But We Are Best Friends, Right?

You're Stephanie And I'm Paulette
You Know What All My Faces Mean
And It's Easy To Smoke It Up, Forget
Everything That Happened In Between

So I Had Love For You And I Was *Forward*
And There's No One I Want To Smoke With More
Someday I'll Buy The *Rizzla* So You Get The Dro
Cause We Are Best Friends, Right, Right, Right, Right?

Because We Are Best Friends, Right?
Because We Are Best Friends, Right?
