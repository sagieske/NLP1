Song:

Sitting in the barroom ordering another beer
She stepped up on the stage, but nobody wanted to hear
And every word she sang was sweet music to my ears.

Chorus:
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say.

It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me.

I sat there at the bar she sang the blues all night
Singing straight from the heart, living every line
I wanna tell you girl, you touched this heart of mine.

Chorus:
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say.

--- Instrumental ---

End of the night, they turned the lights down low
While the band packed up
She was standing there ready to go
I walked up and said, hey, I just want to let you know.

Chorus:
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say
Elise, Elise, I believe every word you say.

It don't matter if the world don't listen
Don't you pay no heed
Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me.

Elise, Elise, come and sing your song with me...
