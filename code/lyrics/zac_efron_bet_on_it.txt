Song:

Everybody's always talking at me
Everybody's tryin' to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on myself instead

(Did you ever?) Lose yourself to get what you want
(Did you ever?) Get on a ride and wanna get off
(Did you ever?) Push away the ones you should have held close
Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know?

I'm not gonna stop
That's who I am
I'll give it all I got
That is my plan
Will learn from what I lost
You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
I'm gonna make it right
That is the way
To turn my life around
Today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

How will I know if there is a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
Thought I've lost my heart, it's breaking
I don't wanna make the same mistake

(Did you ever?) Doubt your dream will ever come true
(Did you ever?) Blame the world but never blame you
(I will never) Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game, if I can't play it my way

I'm not gonna stop
That's who I am
I'll give it all I got
That is my plan
Will learn from what I lost
You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
I'm gonna make it right
That is the way
To turn my life around
Today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

It's no good at all
To see yourself
And not recognize your face
Out on my own
It's such a scary place, oooh!
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe

I'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop 'til I get my shot
That's who I am, that is my plan
Will I end up on top?
You can, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet all you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on me

I'm gonna make it right
That is the way
To turn my life around
Today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it
(You can bet one me!)
