Song:

By the Dave Clark Five
Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they're trying so very hard
To pull us apart
Well we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on loving this way
Well, if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart
Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never never let her go
No matter what the people say
Or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
People talk and try to break us up
When we know they don't understand
Well, I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holding her hand
Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they're trying so very hard
To pull us apart
Well, we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on loving this way
But if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart
Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never never let her go
No matter what the people may say
Or try to do
Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
