Song:

You're like a storm against the window
Follow me around just like a shadow
I'll swim a never-ending ocean
Until you bring back your devotion

It's like I live a thousand lifetimes
Still looking for the one that feels right
See, moving on just isn't working
You lit the fire that I burn in

[Chorus:]
And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

I guess I'm holding on to my faith
A solid hope I'm heading your way
And crawling over is so tempting
We could be more than just amazing

[Chorus:]
And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

[Bridge:]
I couldn't see it
I must have believed a lie
If I admit it would you let me make it right
Is it all gone
Oh no

[Chorus:]
We could be more than just
We could be more than just amazing
And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
And all the others set me thinking
We could be more than just amazing

[Chorus:]
And all I've been doing is protecting
A lie for the sake of my pride
While all the others set me thinking
Straight to the point of what I'm feeling
Oh we could be more than just amazing
