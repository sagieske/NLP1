Song:

Well all right bye bye
To this place that once held this heart of mine
I'm gonna cry you one last tear but I ain't cryin' no more
I know this big old world got somethin' better in store
For me? For me
You can keep this house that we built up togetheri'll be better off out
In the weatherlet the rain wash me downlet the wind come blow me out of
Towni've been lyin' down by the river for a long long timelet the sun
Shine me up like brand new dime
Well all right bye bye
To this place that once held this heart of mine
I'm gonna cry you one last tear but I ain't cryin' no more
I know this big old world got somethin' better in store
For me? For me
Well I've been reachin' reachin'leanin' leanin'
Jumpin', jumpin'
Workin' to win, workin' to win
Seven long years but I have no regretsbaby unlessit's that there'll be
No more days
Like the lovely days that we've seen, you and me
But I guess I must appear to be movin' mighty slowbut it's love that
Makes me linger so
Well all right bye bye
To this place that once held this heart of mine
I'm gonna cry you one last tear but I ain't cryin' no more
I know this big old world got somethin' better in store
For me? For me
