Song:

Ain't no love in the heart of the city,
Ain't no love in the heart of town.
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,
Ain't no love cause you ain't around.
Baby, since you been around.

Ain't no love in the heart of the city,
Ain't no love in the heart of town.
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity, child
Ain't no love cause you ain't around.

Every place that I go,
Well, it seems so strange.
Without you love, baby, baby,
Things have changed.
Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine,
From the city hall
To the county line, that's why

Ain't no love in the heart of the city,
Ain't no love in the heart of town.
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,
Ain't no love cause you ain't around.

(solo)

Every place that I go,
Well, it seems so strange.
Without you love, baby, baby,
Things have changed.
Now that you're gone
Y'know the sun don't shine,
From the city hall
Woman, to the county line, that's why

Ain't no love in the heart of the city,
There ain't no love in the heart of town.
There ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,
Ain't no love cause you ain't around.

(solo)

There ain't no love in the heart of the city,
There ain't no love in the heart of town.
Ain't no love, sure 'nuff is a pity,
Ain't no love cause you ain't around,
Cause you ain't around.
