Well I passed by this little place a time or two beforeand I liked the words they had painted on the doorsocial, Social Aid and Pleasure clubare they drinkin', are they dancingare they havin' a ball, Are they making plans for the next Mardi Grassocial, Social Aid and Pleasure clubi wonder what they're doing at the social aid and pleasure clubthat's two things that I'd like to see plenty more ofi heard a rhythm from some drummin' that was coming from withini smelled the catfish fryin', you know something's cookin'At the Social, Social Aid and Pleasure Clubwhoo! They got a guitar player in therewell I finally got my nerve up and I knocked upon the doorthe man who answered said What would you like to know about the Social, Social Aid and Pleasure Clubi always wondered what they're doin' at the social aid and pleasure clubhe said "Man, just come on in and see for yourself."Social, pleasuresocial, pleasuresocial aid and pleasure clubsocial, pleasuresocial, pleasuresocial, Pleasuresocial, Pleasureetc.
