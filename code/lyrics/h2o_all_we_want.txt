Song:

Cover up your eyes
And put your fingers in your ears
We're about to say some s**t
That you don't wanna hear
There's too many kids out there
Who never stayed to change
Who say some basic truth
Their mom and dad don't understand

All we want
Is only to be wanted
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy

Try and point the finger
While your running from the man
Blame it on the music
Or the movies and the games
Turning up the volume
So that you can hear the sound
Cause what's a kid supposed to do
When no one is around

All we want
Is only to be wanted
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy

It's just a matter of attention
It's too late for intervention
Never give back what you lost
Cause time worth spent is time together

Finally found a mission
So you're always on the go
Leave the kids at home again
With someone you don't know
You were never loved
You had a choice of what to be
You spent all your money
Trying to cover your mistake

All we want
Is only to be wanted
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy
Now while we're screaming for attention
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy now

Yeah, the kids are going crazy right now
And the kids are going crazy now
While their screaming for attention
No one's home

And that's all we want
Is to be wanted
No one's home
And the kids are going crazy now
While we're screaming for attention
No one's home
That's all we want
