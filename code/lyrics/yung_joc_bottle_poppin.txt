[verse 1 - Yung Joc]
I pull up to the club, jumpin out of rovers, lookin like a car show, dats da way we roll up
Dope bois showin luv, all da ho's know of us
Need extra security, dey know dey cant controll us,
I see some niggas hatin, I keep dat supersoaker
So I v.i.p my way standin on da sofas
U can watch me demostrate, da way a playa possed ta, I don burried cha weight, u know we throw dem toasts up
Say ya gettin guap, well shawty we aint heard bout it, finna set-up shop, well we aint even worried bout it
Word on da block, oh dey say u servin pies
I think ya need ta stop, I got some killas dat'll get dat work up out ya
I dont got luv fa u busta's, unless u my kinfolk yea u smell dat fruity fruit ? err'time da wind blow
I throw away dat chump change, im all abot dat bigga dough
Joc he a hood nigga, jus like Gorilla Zoe

[verse 2 - Gorilla Zoe]
When da money start droppin, all da ho's start jockin,
When dem ho's start jockin, bottles start poppin,
When dem bottles start poppin, know dat we're not stoppin
Imma keep bringin bottles, den dem models start flockin,
Imma throw a stack, she gon' throw it back,
I pop da rubberband, she gon' pop ha back,
She know dat I ball, she gon' grind da wall,
She gon' bust it open, fo me & my dwags
Got boi's in da club comin fresh from the trap,
Watch dem boi's cuff they gurls, cuz dey know we got dem stacks
We in da middle of da flo' blowin cush packs,
Got my workers in da bathroom, sellin pill packs,
Now da 4o dont stop cuz dey we got dat guap,
She gon' make ha booty clap & imma throw another knot,
When da money still phat, dey know dat its a wrap,
Bottle poppin ova herr, tell da dj run it back

[chorus - Gorilla Zoe chopped & screwed]
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,(aye)
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,(aye)
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,(aye)
Say-say u gettin money, we-we aint seen nuttin
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,
We bottle poppin, we-we bottle poppin,
Say-say u gettin money, we-we aint seen nuttin

[verse 3 - Yung Joc]
When my nigga steve died,
U know we popped dem bottles,
Nigga's tried to run & hide,
We went lookin wit dem choppa's,
Now its time to take a ride, in dat all black impala,
If u niggas think im lyin', I put dat on my momma,
& dats y err'time, his birthday come up,
Imma hit da town, from sun down-ta-sun up
Buy a couple rounds, till dey all get drug up,
Fo my nigga, im a clown
Like the numba 1 stunna
Yea we in da club, my niggas on a pill or two
Throw dat bitch a dub, tell dat ho' "im felling u"
Pour ha some of dis bub, yea dats what im finna do,
Den I ask a question, "shorty what'chu in to ?"
Den she started blushing, told me bring a friend or two
A whole lotta rubba's we gon' cut ha' like a gin-su
Flexin knots of money, dats da shit beginna's do
She know im gettin money & she wann be a winna too !!!
