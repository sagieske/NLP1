Song:

A moment in time, she closes her eyes
Holding the door like he holds her life
Frozen in time, she's made up her mind
The last tear has fallen, she takes back her life

Where are the days when we used to laugh
Where are the days when we cried out of joy

Everything it's just too much
Oh God, make it right
Rescue the love that I had
Bring back the light
Everything it's just too much
Show me the way
Take away the darkness
Bring back the day

Now all that is left, a skyline of scars
Her shackled wrists, his spitting fists and throwing strife
