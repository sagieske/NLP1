Song:

How, how could I be so blind
I didn't see you standing staring right at me
How, how could you leave me like
I wasn't doing anything to make you leave me for good

And all I ever wanted was love
And all I ever wanted was to be loved
And all I ever wanted was your love
And all I ever wanted was you

[Chorus:]
To be my life
To be my everything
To be with you
Is all I wanna do

[repeat chorus]

How, how I wish it never ended
'Cause what we had was so string and beautiful
How, how could you treat me so bad
You didn't even leave a note with a sour goodbye

And all I ever wanted was love
And all I ever wanted was to be loved
And all I ever wanted was your love
And all I ever wanted was you

[repeat chorus 2x]

When all ever wanted was love
And all ever wanted was you

[repeat chorus 4x]
