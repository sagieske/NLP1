Song:

Turn the music up
Turn the music up.
Move it
Move it
Baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance
Dance
Dance?
And I can't stop this rhythm in my heart.
Move it
Move it
Baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance
Dance
Dance?
Without this beat my life would fall apart.
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot
Gotta make a lot of money.
Gonna break your heart. Watch out boy
Watch out boy
Watch out boy.
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot

Gotta make a lot of money
Gonna break your heart.
But I'm the only one with the key
And that's me.
Sometimes you wake up in the morning with the bass line

A ray of sunshine.
Sometimes you know today you're gonna have a good time

And you're ready to go.
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn it up
Cause it's alright.
Greedy men in far off places
Don't be afraid to show your faces.
We know what you've done is wrong
But clap your hands

And sing along now!
Don't even bother to let us know

When you flick the switch and stop the show

Because the party has begun and we'll still be dancing
As-you-run-now!
Come on
Everybody ! Get on with your party !
And don't let nobody say you're wrong. - O. K.
So you've lost control
But they'll never steal your soul
No way !
That they're gonna spoil your fun.
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you.
I'm just a love machine
A huggin' kissin' fiend.
I think it's high time you knew whenever I think of you

My mind blows a fuse
Baby
When I look in your eyes.
My meter starts to rise and I become confused.
My voltage regulator cools when I'm sitting next to you.
Electricity starts to flow and my indicator starts to glow - wooo.
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you. . . .
I'm just a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you. . . .
