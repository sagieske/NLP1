Song:

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen.
Woman there, they don't treat you mean
In Abilene.

I sit alone, every night
Watch the trains roll out of sight
How I wish they'd carry me back
To Abilene.

Wish I could go there
The girl that I know there
Would love me all of my day
Why did I leave her
Never to see her
Oh, What a price to pay.

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen.
Woman there, they don't treat you mean
In Abilene.

--- Whistles with Instrumental ---

Wish I could go there
The girl that I know there
Would love me all of my day
Why did I leave her
Never to see her
Oh, What a price to pay.

Abilene, (Oh Abilene), Abilene, (My Abilene)
Prettiest town I've ever seen.
Woman there, never treat you mean
In Abilene.

--- Whistles with Instrumental to fade ---
