Song:

Let me tell you about this boy I know
He thinks he'll get the best of me
He tries to win my affection
With a fancy selection
Of sweet talk and flattery

What my mama had told me
What my mama done told me
Is what this is leading to

Well a girl should know better
And I do

I won't say he's cute
He's got money to-boot
That he doesn't mind spending on me
I let him see me a lot
I figure why not
There's worse places I could be

And I have to remind him
That he'll shudder to find a girl he can be boss to

But a girl should know better
And I do

I wasn't born yesterday
A girl's gotta grow up fast these days
All these men seem nice at first
But after a while they get bad and get worse

Well my mama did teach me
That I shouldn't let you reach me
And I'm sad that I get to miss
And I feel it when we kiss

And when the preacher asks if I'm ready for the task to love and honor you
I say a girl should know better
And I do

And when the preacher asks if I'm ready for the task to love and honor you
I say a girl should know better
And I do

I say a girl should know better
Oh, 'cause I do

I say a girl should know better
I - and I do!
