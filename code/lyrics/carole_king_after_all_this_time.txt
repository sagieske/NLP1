Song:

Ooh, I get a feeling every night when you come home
That life is sweet, yeah, baby
Sweeter than a honeycomb
And oh, darlin, I'm so glad that you are mine
And that you still love me after all this time

You bring music to my soul
Yes, and I can hear it play
Sweeter and longer and stronger
With each and every passing day
And, oh lord, our love is just like vintage wine
Because it's still so good after all this time

I believe, I believe with your sweet love
That you could make a tiger tame
Fill a desert full of rain
Bring me joy when I'm in pain

And even on the coldest winter day
I can hear my heart sing, yeah, baby
For the warmth and the light and the love you give me
To me it's like an early spring
No matter what the season, there can be no doubt in my mind
That I still love you after all this time
