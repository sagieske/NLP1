Version 1

Turn it around, baby
Spend more time with me
Try to believe you
Try to believe you...
Turn it around, baby
Spend more time with me
It's getting insane, I know
Let it not be true...
Turn it around baby...
Turn it around...
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I can only be myself...
Turn it around (x6)
Turn it around, baby
Let us break the rules
You know I need you
I need to feel you
Turn it around baby
And find me here
Waiting for you babe
Only for you babe
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I can only be myself...

Version 2

Turn it around baby
Spend more time with me
Try to believe you, try to believe you
Turn it around baby
Spend more time with me
It's getting insane I know
Let it not be true
Turn it around baby
Turn it around
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I can only be myself
Turn it around baby
It's just my jealousy
I don't want to lose you
Don't wanna lose you
Turn it around baby
We've come too far
Don't let this slip away
Don't leave me now
Turn it around baby
Turn it around
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I need you
I can only be myself with you
I can only be myself
I can only be myself
I can only be myself
