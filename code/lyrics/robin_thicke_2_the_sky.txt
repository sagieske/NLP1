Song:

Its amazing the way the darkness falls
And the truth out there is cold
And nothing to keep you warm
Jealousy and lies within me
I got a feeling the sun wont shine today
And I gotta to know right now
Will I be rich, have everything I want
I stop myself and look to the sky

Oh I got to give myself up to the sky
The only truth is in the sky

Nobody else can tell cause I'm stuck in a spell
Of greed and anger and hate
Oh I tried I tried I tried to rise above it
But it comes right back
Creeps up on me and it hits me
Double time

This can't be my fate
Its never too late
I wake up holding on to this pain
And there's nothing else I can do
But 2 give myself up to the sky

When you ask yourself
Hey why me and why not me?
When you're down on your knees
Look 2 the sky
Just look 2 the sky
You don't need no faster car
Or no bigger house
All you really need is friends and love
Hey come on home
Just throw up your hands
Throw up your heart
All you really need is love
I'm comin home
So come on home
