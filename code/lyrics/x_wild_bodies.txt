[Originally performed by s** Pistols]

She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree

She was a no-one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace

Body I'm not an animal
Mummy I'm not an abortion

Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby screaming

Body screaming f*****g bloody mess
It's not an animal it's an abortion

Body I'm not an animal
Body I'm not an abortion

Throbbing squirm, gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge I'm not a loss in
Protein I'm not a throbbing squirm Ah!

F**k fhis and f**k that
F**k it all and f**k the f*****g brat
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
I don't wanna baby that looks like that.

Body I'm not an animal
Body I'm not an abortion
