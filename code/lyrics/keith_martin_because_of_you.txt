If: ever you wondered if you touched my soul yes, you do Since.
I met you I'm not the same You. bring life to everything I Do
Just. the way you say hello With. one touch I can't let go Never.
thought I'd fall in love with you Ch.

Because: of you My. life has changed Thank. you for the love And
the joy you bring Because. of you I feel no shame I'll. tell The
world it's because of you V.

Sometimes: I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you You. Captured
something inside of me You. make all of my dreams Come
true It's. not enough that you love me for me You. reached Inside
and touched me internally I. love you best explains how I
feel for you Ch.

Because: of you My. life has changed Thank. you for the love And
the joy you bring Because. of you I feel no shame I'll. tell The
world it's because of you Br.

The: magic in your eyes true, love I can't deny When. you hold Me
I just lose control I. want you to know that I'm never letting Go
You. mean so much to me I, want the world to see it's Because
of you Ch.

Because: of you My. life has changed Thank. you for the love And
the joy you bring Because. of you I feel no shame I'll. tell The
