Song:

They say the joint was rockin'
Goin' round and round,
Yeah reelin' and a rockin',
What a crazy sound,
Well they never stop a rockin'
'till the moon went down.

Oh it sound so sweet,
Gotta take me a chance,
Rose out of my seat,
Just had to dance,
Started movin' ma feet,
Well and clappin' my hands.

Well the joint started rockin'
Goin' round and round,
Yeah reelin' and a rockin',
What a crazy sound,
Well they never stoped rockin'
'till the moon went down.

Twelve o'clock
Well the place was packed
Front doors was locked
Well the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back

Well the kept on rockin'
Goin' round and round,
Yeah reelin' and a rockin',
What a crazy sound,
Well you never stop rockin'
'till the moon went down.
