Song:

I've learned a lesson
From being down at my worst
I count my blessings
I wouldn't say I've been cursed

It's not that easy
It's not that easy to start
I'm trying to tell you
It's not so hard

You were just impossible to find
Until I heard you in the garden
Singing the saddest song
You were singing the saddest song

Huddled neat the willow on a cold night
You were shadowed from the moonlight
Singing the saddest song
You were singing the saddest song
You know

Take just a second
Are you really alone?
You change directions and you find
You're no closer to home
If there's an answer
And if that answer is right
Let go even if you don't know why

Ooooh
But I saw you change in a blink of an eye
And it's so hard
It's so hard to see you cry, cry, crying aaah

Standing on the edge of breaking through
Never seemed impossible to you
When you're singing the saddest song
When you're singing the saddest song

Only once you let the world come near you
Because everyone can hear you
Singing the saddest song
When you're singing the saddest song
You know

Ooooh
Whoaaa
Oooh

Ooooh
Whoa
Saddest song

Only once you let the world come near you
Because everyone can hear you
Singing the saddest song
When you're singing the saddest song
You know
