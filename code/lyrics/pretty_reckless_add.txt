Song:

I'm likin the color, I'm likin it bold
I've got an attitude, you better be rude
I like gettin crazy, I'm likin the toys
Yea I love loud noise

Am I makin you nervous am I makin you fear
I kno that your anxious so come over here
Look at my makeup play with my hair
Take a peek under

Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey hey that's what the night is for
I've got add so don't mess with me
Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh owwww

I live for excitment do ya live for the ride
Lets kiss for your camera and then I'll decide
I'm attracted to chaos, attracted to rage
And I might offend you

I like to play nice so I can be rude
I might be to forward did I tell you to soon
That I like the sharade and I like to impose
Get me a drink

Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey hey that's what the night is for
I've got add so don't mess with me
Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored

Woah Oh that's what the night is for
I'm drunk so now I'm easily bored
So baby don't cha don't cha don't cha try and reason with me
Don't cha don't cha don't cha try and reason with me
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh owwww

Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored
Hey hey that's what the night is for
I've got add so don't mess with me
Cuz I'm young and I'm easily bored

Woah Oh that's what the night is for
I'm drunk so now I'm easily bored
So baby don't cha don't cha don't cha try and reason with me
Don't cha don't cha don't cha try and reason with me
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh owwww
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh owwww
Ohh Ohhh Ohhh owwwwww!
