Song:

Silent hell on the marble slab
The best trip that I've ever had
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around
My drinks on empty, need another round

[chorus:]
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere
Don't act like you know, I been here so many times
I never seen you before
But now that I have, I don't wanna see you no more

Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

[repeat chorus]

Ah-ah, auto pilot no control
Ah-ah, ahh
Ah-ah, auto pilot no control
Ah-ah, ahh

Higher than a jet plane with you
Higher than a jet plane with you

[repeat chorus]
