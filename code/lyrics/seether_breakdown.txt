Song:

The sun is gone and the flowers rot
Words are spaces between us
And I should've been drown in the rivers I've found of token lost
And I should've been down when you made me insecure

So break me down if it makes you feel right (so break me down)
And hate me now if it keeps you alright(so break me down)
You can't break me down if it takes all your might
'Cause I'm so much more than meets the eye

And I'm the one you can never trust
'Cause wounds are ways to reveal us
And, yeah, I could have tried and devoted my life to both of us
But what a waste of my time when the world we had was yours

So break me down if it makes you feel right (so break me down)
And hate me now if it keeps you alright (so break me down)
You can't break me down if it takes all your might
'Cause I'm so much more than all your lies

Hate me, break me down
(So break me down, So break me down)
So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you alright
You can't break me down if it takes all your might
'Cause I'm so much more than meets the eye
