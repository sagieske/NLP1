Song:

The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding

The holy war was slowly building
Heroes leaving for the great crusade
Seek reward in the ever after
Ever after
Ever after

Don't wanna have to lose you baby
Don't want to have to take you back
You know I'll never lose you baby
Abuse you baby
Use you baby

You know I'll always help you baby
But I just can't do that
I know I said I'd help you baby
Here's my wallet
Call me sometime

Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love

The fruit of love was in the future
Around the corner and over the hill
The act of love was slowly pounding
Slowly pounding
Slowly pounding

Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
Act of love
