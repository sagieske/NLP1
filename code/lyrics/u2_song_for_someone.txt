Song:

You've got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you, I've found a right

If there is a light
You can always see
And there is a world
We can always be
If there is a dark
That we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light
Don't let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone

You let me into a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there is yours to take

I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were so long to heal
But this could be the night

If there is a light
You can always see
And there is a world
We can always be
If there is a dark
Within and without
And there is a light
Don't let it go out
And this is a song
A song for someone
This is a song
A song for someone

And I'm a long way
From your hill or cavalry
And I'm a long way
From where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can always see
And there is a world we can always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out
