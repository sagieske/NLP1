Song:

Not a believer inside the mosque, am I
Nor a pagan disciple of false rites
Not the pure amongst the impure
Neither Moses, nor the Pharoh

Bulleh! To me, I am not known

Not in the holy Vedas, am I
Nor in opium, neither in wine
Not in the drunkard's craze
Niether awake, nor in a sleeping daze

Bulleh! To me, I am not known

In happiness nor in sorrow, am I
Neither clean, nor a filthy mire
Not from water, nor from earth
Neither fire, nor from air, is my birth

Bulleh! To me, I am not known

Not an Arab, nor Lahori
Neither Hindi, nor Nagauri
Hindu, Turk (Muslim), nor Peshawari
Nor do I live in Nadaun

Bulleh! To me, I am not known

Secrets of religion, I have not known
From Adam and Eve, I am not born
I am not the name I assume
Not in stillness, nor on the move

Bulleh! To me, I am not known

I am the first, I am the last
None other, have I ever known
I am the wisest of them all
Bulleh! Do I stand alone?

Bulleh! To me, I am not known
