Song:

It's my fault
As of now
If you needed me so
Why could you not look me in the eye

This could be the big time
Or be the biggest demonstration
Of what not to do

[Chorus:]
I'm strung up, I'm not levitatin'
I wanted to say (wanted to say)
Oh maybe you're right
Once again
I lost when I hesitated
For the life of me

Oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh

If it's my salt
In your eyes
You can crucify me
If you think you can find the time

It's not about frustration
It's about what we've got here and now
I'm not holdin' you up am I

I thought we were levitatin'
I wanted to say (wanted to say)
Oh maybe you're right
Once again
I lost when I hesitated
For the life of me'

(Ah')
I don't mind waitin'
Oh I, I don't mind
I don't mind waitin'
Waitin'

[Instrumental]

I'm not levitatin'
I wanted to say
Oh maybe you're right
Once again
I lost when I hesitated
For the life of me'

'Cause I just wanted
I just wanna say
Baby I believe
Believe you were right
