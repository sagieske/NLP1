Song:

They say that love is a gave of give and take
Everybody hurting and everything at stake
All those words to date still ring true
But I will love no one else and only you
But can we fight fate

With the winds against our backs
From different sides of the railroad tracks
Our love under attack
I will wait for our sun to set
Your angel eyes I will never forget
Our love will stand strong
Like Romeo and Juliet

Montague's and Capulet's fighting for one love
We pray for resolution from up above
Put your hand in mine and hold on tight
Together we will bind in love and end this fight
But can we chance fate

With the winds against our backs
From different sides of the railroad tracks
Our love under attack
I will wait for our sun to set
Your angel eyes I will never forget
Our love will stand strong
Like Romeo and Juliet

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
I will love no one else and only you

With the winds against our backs
From different sides of the railroad tracks
Our love under attack
I will wait for our sun to set
Your angel eyes I will never forget
Our love will stand strong
Like Romeo and Juliet
Like Romeo and Juliet
