Song:

The party's nearly over, will you have this dance with me
I've watched you here for hours and I've waited patiently
And I feel my passion pounding and my heart beats just for you
Do you wanna spend the night, Do you wanna spend the night
The evening is still young say darlin' what you gonna do

You know I need your company to get me through the night
I've never had a fantasy but now the time is right

When I feel you next to me it wets my appetite
So come on honey, please be fair, you know that it's alright
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, well now baby, baby-y-y

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight
I've never seen a face like yours, you are a tempt to me
With candlelight, a fireplace, a view out on the sea
My friends will all be envious of how it's gonna be
We'll spend this night in paradise, no macho men for me-ee

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too-oo
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Come on baby, baby-y-y
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight

Oh baby, don't you wanna see me too-oo
Oh baby, well now I wanna be with you
Oh baby, there's so much that we could do-oo-oo
Oh honey-ey-ey-ey-ey

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Hug you, baby, baby,
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight

Happiness I've heard it said is just a kiss away
So kiss me baby, let us see if truth's in what they say
I feel my body tremble and the earth just starts to quake
I never knew this ecstacy, how much more can I take

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Come on baby, baby-y-y
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight
Well now honey, let's spend the night in paradise
Oh honey, there's so much that we can do-oo, oh baby-y-y-y
Just you, just me, underneath the li-i-ights

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Come on baby, baby-y, yeah-eah

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, There's so much that we can do
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, No one can love you like I do
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Come on baby, baby-y, yeah-eah
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight

Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, Say you wanna see me too-oo-oo
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you-ou, baby
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, With you and only you
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, I wanna be with you-ou
Do you wanna spend the ni-ight, With you and only you
