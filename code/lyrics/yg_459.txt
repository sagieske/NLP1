Song:

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Ain't no telling where we going when we rolling on the West side
Me and my homies we rolling up until the sun rise
And I didn't want to f**k him but I did it just to get by
I, get, no, sleep [?]
I didn't want to get him but I got him n***a 459
You get it how you livin' when you dealing with the Bompton life

[Verse 1: yg]
I was out plottin', Batman, Robin
Pops was in jail, I was out poppin'
I was with the homies, you was with your b***h
You was thinkin' love, I was thinkin' rich
Everything [?], flatscreens, notebooks
Even paintings and I was an artist in the making
[?] jewelry boxes, loafers [?]
At the pawn shop like what you got I need all of that
[?] that's how it had to be
If I ain't know you, to me you was just another robbery
Uh, [?] to the fat head
If the neighbors saw us we got ghosts like Pac Man

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: yg]
Cops coming out running
I'm thuggin', the bird come out ducking
Hoping they don't shoot
You only get once chance to make it to the top
And we taking shots like hoops
I hear [?] I'm in the yard we on the roof top
Like f**k we finna get caught
"Hurry and toss the [?]"
And the freedom change the situation
And f**k the police them handcuffs is irritating
Just wonder what my mom gon' say
When they lock me up and send me miles aways
Had to take it day to day
Make [?]
Catching cases and catching fades
I was in the county [?]
I got a stripe and took it as a live learn lesson
They let me out of jail I was two steppin'

[Hook:]

[Outro: Natasha Mosley]
It's alright and it's okay
459 we roll this way
East side, West side Bompton gang
We still function we don't care
Gotta respect my struggle
Understand my hustle
Nothin' but a G thang baby
It's nothin' but a G thang baby
