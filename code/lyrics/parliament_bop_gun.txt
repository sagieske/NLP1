"Bop Gun (Endangered Species)"
Hmm!
Yeah!
Oooooh, yeahhh-aayy!

On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' right on you, baby!
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Down to get down, (down!) baby

Turn me loose
We shall overcome
Where did you get that funk from, huh?

Turn me on
They're spoiling the fun
Let's shoot them with the bop gun

On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' right around, (hey baby)
We got to get over the hump (x4)
On guard!
Defend yourself!
Bound to get down, baby (hey!)

Turn me loose
Let me shoot them with the bop gun, ha, hmm

Endangered species (x3)
Let me shoot them with the bop gun
Endangered species (x4)

We got to get over the hump (x4)

When the syndrome is around (on guard!)
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Call on the funk, ohhh

On guard!
Defend yourself!
We shall overcome
Where did you get that funk from?
They're spoiling the fun
Shoot them with the bop gun
Ohh, hey baby
On guard!
Protect yourself!
Movin' in on you, baby
I don't think you hear me
I said they're spoiling the fun
We shall overcome
We got to shoot them with the bop gun
Hey, babe
Bound to get down
Closing in on you

When the syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you got to do is
Call on the funk (moving in on you, baby)

To dance is a protection
Funk is your connection
All you got to do is
Funk and dance

On guard!
Protect yourself!
On guard!
Defend yourself!

Endangered species (x5)
Shoot them with the bop gun
Endangered species (x7)
You got to shoot them with the bop gun
Endangered species (x6)
You got to shoot them with the bop gun

When the syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Call on the funk

On guard!
Defend yourself!
Movin' in on you
Turn me loose
We shall overcome
Where'd you get that funk from, huh?
I still said they're spoiling the fun
Shoot them with my bop gun
Hey, babe
Turn me loose, huh
Watch me get over the hump, ha!
Hey, babe

I got to get over the hump (x10) (we got to get on by the hump)
On guard!
Hey babe
I got to get over the hump (x4) (got to get on by the hump)
On guard!
I got to get over the hump
Watch me, I'm gonna shoot them with my bop gun
I got to get over the hump (x8) (I got to get on by the hump, hey baby)
On guard!
Ooh
I got to get over the hump (x9) (I got to get on by the hump)
On guard!
Shoot them with my bop gun
I got to get over the hump (x9)
Hey babe, hey babe, ohh!
On guard!
Defend yourself
I'm gonna shoot them with my bop gun
I got to get over the hump (x8)
Watch me
