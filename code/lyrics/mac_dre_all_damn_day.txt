Song:

[Verse:]
Microphone check let me get to the beat
Dedicated to you b*****s, let me spit to you freaks
I'm gonna serve it to you straight a little something like this
Not one of those n****s that be liking to kiss
Theres no telling what your tongue licks, it might be big dicks
So you better try kissing on them other tricks
'Cause???? I like to ball hog
I know you love what I shove and thrust up in your c***...
All damn day

[Chorus:]
All damn day ho
All damn day ho (I'm gonna rock this motherfucka all night yall)
All damn day ho
All damn day ho (I'm gonna rock this motherfucka all night yall)

[Verse 2:]
I'm md and mackin' is my duty
So when I step to you girl and tap you on your big booty
And start spittin' some pimpin' a** serious s**t
Don't even start trippin' on how freaky you get
Its just a gift to G-A-B, to get to your P-A-D
Bash in your a**, inside of the B-E-D
Bust a 415 and not the 012
Now you fiending for more, but you wait 'til I call you
See some of these n****s cold want you to jock 'em
Stupid motherfuckas, but I can't knock 'em
I just wanna bash ho, and only get cash ho
You want Dre to stay and lay, but I have to pass ho

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
'Cause that lovey dovey s**t just ain't gon' get it
When I pick you up to f**k, I straight hit it and quit it
And you don't trip because the sexin' is good, I be wreckin' 'em good
And they be back in the hood
Tellin' my cuddies how cool it was
Now another romp player might give you a buzz
Young C-you-are-T, or maybe young Marty
Or my homeboy J might be your type of party
Who ever it is, they gon' get with you b***h
And don't even think they gon' sit with you b***h
No talkin' and walkin' 'cause that s**t is funny style
You pay me and lay me and when I take your money I'll...
Spend that s**t all damn day

[Chorus:]

[Verse 4]
I'm hard but saucy b***h back on off me
Steady tryin' to toss me, ho smell the coffee
I gave you some ho, did not c** though
Your too damn dumb ho, what you actin' sprung fo'?
I'm hard to get with, pimperistic
I want your lipstick on top of my d**k tip
I'm from the V-A double L E-J
O and you know ho, the things that we say
Are simple and plain, nothing but game
And if you aint up on it Mac Dre is the name
I want a fat a** joint of that potent zesty
And a thick chocolate b***h whose name is Nestle
From the C-are-E-S-T, 'cause that's where the best be
Suckas get jealous and they try to test me
So I carry a nine all the time
Dope raps I rhyme, this is how I grind
Making stacks of cash, down to wax that a**
A n***a ready to blast a m*******a real fast
Dickin' the ho's, never lickin' the ho's
Big black d**k is what I stick in the ho's
I shake 'em, I break 'em, but never will I take 'em
To eat hamburgers let alone some steak and
Lobster, 'cause baby I'm a mobster
You tell your friends how I robbed ya

[Chorus:]
