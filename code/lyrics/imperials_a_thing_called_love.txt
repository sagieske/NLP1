Song:

Six foot six stood on the ground, weighted 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man who'd gamble on love
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love

Chorus:
Can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
Like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, it can put you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love

Some men are like me; they worry and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a thing called love
But then I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I say thank God this world was blessed with the thing called love

Chorus
