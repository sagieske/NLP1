Song:

I had a small black book
But I threw it away
When you told me your name
I gotta keep you babe

I'll call quits
With all them other chicks
You've got me wondering
Maybe there could be more to this

This is the first time I've ever felt
All of the feelings that I'm feeling now
I wanna know if we
Can make this happen baby, cuz' you got me

I wanna make this real
Somehow you make me feel
Like you're the only girl in the world

I gotta make you see
How beautiful it'd be
If we could make this happen baby

I'll be prince charming
If you'll be mine, darlin'
And you'll be my only
Will you be my only girl?

You're so fine
Better yet let me say
That I find you divine
I've got to keep you mine

I lose sleep
But I'm dreaming constantly
You've got me day dreaming conciously
Honestly, I believe...

This is the first time I've ever felt
Whatever feeling that I'm feeling now
I wanna know if we
Can make this happen baby, cuz' you got me

I wanna make this real
Somehow you make me feel
Like you're the only girl in the world

I gotta make you see
How beautiful it'd be
If we could make this happen baby

I'll be prince charming
If you'll be mine, darlin'
And you'll be my only
Will you be my only girl?

This, this isn't a drill
I can't keep still
This love is real
Now, all of that time I spent without you baby
Well, that all ends here
If you'll let that end here
I wanna, I've just got to know if we
Can make this happen baby, cuz' you got me

I wanna make this real
Somehow you make me feel
Like you're the only girl in the world

I gotta make you see
How beautiful it'd be
If we could make this happen baby

I'll be prince charming
If you'll be mine, darlin'
And you'll be my only
Will you be my only girl?
