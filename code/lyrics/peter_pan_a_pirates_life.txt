Pirates:
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life,
A-rovin' over the sea,
Give me a career as a buccaneer
It's the life of a pirate for me
Oh, the life of a pirate for me!
Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life,
They never bury you're bones,
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
Drops in on his friend, Davey Jones
Oh, my good friend, Davey Jones!
