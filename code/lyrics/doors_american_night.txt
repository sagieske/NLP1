Song:

All hail the American night!
What was that?
I don't know
Sounds like guns... Thunder.
(Roadhouse Blues)
... Alright! Alright! Alright!
Hey, listen! Listen! Listen, man! Listen, man!
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology...
Yeah, that's right... That's right, baby, I... I am a
Sagittarius
The most philosophical of all the signs
But anyway, I don't believe in it
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this
I don't know what's gonna happen, man, but I wanna have
My kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames
Alright!
