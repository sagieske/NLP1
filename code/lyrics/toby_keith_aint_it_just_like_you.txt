Song:

Girl your bags are packed
And you ain't coming back is written on them
Take these memories with you
They're just sad, and they're blue and I don't want them
Oh you're not so sure that you're in love anymore
And I ain't gonna beg you to stay
Ain't it just like you to leave
Ain't it just like me to let you walk away

I hold a tender place in my heart for you and you know it
I've never said it out loud
Guess I was too proud to ever show it
We always thought some night that we might get it right
But that ain't going to happen today
Ain't it just like you to leave
Ain't it just like me to let you walk away

Honey you must think my heart is a revolving door
The way you come and go as you please
I don't know if I should give up or try
Or get down on my knees
Ain't it just like me to pray
Ain't it just like you to turn and walk away

Here you are at my door
You're wanting in, you're wanting more and it's open
You win me over with that grin
So I let you on in, and I'm hopin'
That this time you might stay forever
But baby that just ain't your style
Ain't it just like you to smile
Ain't it just like me to let you stay awhile

Oh you must think my heart is a revolving door
The way you come and go as you please
And I don't know if I should give up or try
Or get down on my knees
Ain't it just like me to pray
Ain't it just like you to make me feel this way

Ain't it just like you to smile
Ain't it just like me to let you stay awhile

Girl your bags are packed
And you ain't coming back is written on them
