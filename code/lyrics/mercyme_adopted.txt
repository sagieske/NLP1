Song:

Hallelujah, God has spoken and I know this changes eveything
Hallelujah, praise Him only,
Sing the slaves adopted by the King

Glory be to my Father who reigns
For I met Him and I cannot be the same
When in bondage, to Jesus I came
He took my place and He changed my name.

Hallelujah Hallelujah...
