Song:

This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home.

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25.

This is the straw, final straw in the
Roof of my mouth as I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time.

You're the only thing that I love
It scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer.

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth I'm lost for words.

What have I done it's too late for that
What have I become truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask... This time.
