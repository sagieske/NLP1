Song:

Bliss
Dear smoky room
Stardust in the eyes
Anything will rise
Our bellys bloomed
Sunset red fly toes
Haunted mind
Where I go there it goes
Your soul within mine
I'm a book in my dreams
See what I love you means
Far for the ground
Below the sky
No way around
Is where we hide
Between the sound
Before the light
My love and I live in never to be found

The music plays
Greatest overtimes
Candles burned down
For paper planes
Nothing is everything
Details too
You're the thrills for my wings
I'm flying for you
I'm a book in my dreams
See how I love
You feels

Far for the ground
Below the sky
No way around
Is where we hide
Between the sound
Before the light
My love and I live in never to be found

J'ai fini d'me chercher
Falling into your nest
Depuis qu'j't'ai trouv
I call it bliss
La meilleure personne en moi
For the best and less and the rest
Au fond c'est toujours toi
Nothing is quite like it use to be
Mon éˆ“e, mon amour, ma foi
Deep down inside of me
Les anges se passeront de toi
I'm done searching for myself
Reste encore au creux de moi
Since you're flowing in my rains
Cinq minutes jusqu'l'infini

Far for the ground
Below the sky
No way around
Is where we hide
Between the sound
Before the light
My love and I live in never to be found


Below the sky
No way around
Is where we hide
Between the sound
Before the light
My love and I live in never to be found
