Song:

Could you move in slow motion, everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little, and save the best part for last
You speak in riddles, and your intentions turn me on
I'm yours forever, will you love me when I'm gone?

When I'm gone (You're an unfenced fire)
When I'm gone (Over walls we trample)
When I'm gone (It's you I admire)
When I'm gone, my living example

Your eyes are an undiscovered ocean far away
Any minute now keeping both poets and priests at bay
Don't get ahead of me, could we just this once see eye to eye
Could you want perhaps me, ask me how it feels to vie

To vie (You're an unfenced fire)
To vie (Over walls we trample)
To vie (It's you I admire)
To vie, my living example

It's a photograph discovered a decade after
It's a cannon blast discuised as a fire cracker
It's enough to bring a brick wall to it's knees
And say, please...

Could you move in slow motion, everything goes by so fast
Just slow down a little, and save the best part for last

For last (You're an unfenced fire)
For last (Over walls we trample)
For last (It's you I admire)
For last, my living example

My living example
It's you I admire
My living example
