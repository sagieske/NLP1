Song:

Hey Jim
Jim
Just a minute y'all

I want to ask you something

I want you to spell something for me Jim

Can you do that? Sure John.
But I want you to spell for me New York.
John
Why do you ask me to do that?
I just want you to spell New York Jim.
Well alright I'm gonna go ahead man.

New York
That's N-E-W Y-O-are-K man

No Jim
You've made a mistake Jim
I'm gonna teach you the right way
And the proper way to spell New York.
Well go ahead John.
A knife
A fork
A bottle and a cork
That's the way we spell New York
Jim.
You see I'm a dynamite.

So all you got to do is hold me tight

Because I'm out a sight you know.
Because I'm dynamite.

But everytime I walk in the rain.
Man
O man
I feel a pain
I feel a burnin' pain
Keep on burning
In my bloody brain.

I've got cokane running around my brain

I've got cokane running around my brain.
I want to dig me soul brothers and sisters
I want you to hold me tight cause I'm a dynamite
I got cokane in my brain.

No matter where I treat my guests
You see
They always like my kitchen best

'cause I've cokane running around my brain
Cokane running around my brain yea.
Hey Jim
Jim
Where is Jim man?
I want to tell you soethin'
I want to tell you somethin'
I want you to spell for me New York
Come on Jim
How you spell New York?

A knife
A fork
A bottle and a cork
That's the way we spell New York right on
Out of sight man right on
O right on. Yeah right on.

Man oh man I run around
I've got to read the setting sun
'cause I've got cokane
A whole lot
A whole lot of cokane man.
Running around my brain
Running around my brain
Cokane
Cokane
Running around my brain yeah.
