Song:

Woman in a million to me
I never loved so much
Is it any wonder I'm alive
No one ever knows what makes a
Virtue or a vice
Let it be the spell I'm under
(These naked eyes)
Let it be the rain and thunder comes

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh,
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold
Love is the key and the cause
And it's makin' us whole

Made me a little crazy, but I
Soon realize my fate
Every little touch I'm paralyzed
No one ever know what makes
An angel in disguise
Let me be the one to taste you
Those naked eyes
No pity if the city ever crumbles down

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh,
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and we share
Love is the force and the edge
And it's ready for those who dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
(And baby, I'll take you there)

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh,
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me

Love is the earth and the wind
And the fire and the soul
Love is the key and the cause
And it's makin' us whole
Love is the force and the edge
And it's yours if you dare
Love is above and beyond
And I'm taking you there
(Baby, I'll take you there)

I go above and beyond the sun
Some love never dies
Story of our lives, ohh,
Swear by the stars above
And late at night I pray to myself
That you and I got everything we need
I'd give it all for you and me
