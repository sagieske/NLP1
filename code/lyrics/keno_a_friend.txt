Song:

I've still been searching
And long have I waited
For someone to like me as me
To laugh with, To cry with
To be just beside with
A friend that's who I need

To fight with, Make up with
To know that you need them
Believing that they need you, too
To walk hand in hand with
To argue to talk with
A friend that's who I need

And even though
I make mistakes
And never do anything right
A smile, a hug
Can change all that
And everything will be alright

Someone who'll share
All my dreams and ambitions
Someone who'll love me as me
I need this person
Someone to rely on
A friend that's who I need

A friend that's who I need
