Written by ugly kid joe

Pray by the candle and I hope to see light
Wait for the moment but it's never right
So now I'm sailing on the oceans so wide
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams and I
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light
Wait for the moment but it's never right
So I'm the captain my ships got a hole in the side
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams at night
Can you see me walking through the trees
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze
Can you see me walking through the trees
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light
Wait for the moment but it's never right
Across the water I watch my ship waves goodbye
I'm all alone me and my daydreams at night
