Song:

They started a fire, started a fire
To change those tears to smiles
I'll give you something which isn't that much
But I'm sure somehow we'll be in touch

Started a fire, hoping to fight
Night time, night time
Look at the stars shining so bright
And he's there

I'm reading your mind
Yes, I'm reading your mind
[X5]
So go ahead, well baby just smile

Here is my thing, it isn't that much
But I'm sure somehow we'll be in touch
We love you so much

Started a fire hoping to fight
Night time, night time
Look at the stars shining so bright
Yes, he's there

Started a fire hoping to fight
Night time, night time
Look at the stars shining so bright
Yes, he's there
