Song:

Angelina's going out tonight
Like a dream clear out of sight
When she returns, we'll be as one together
Like a diamond in a world of stone
She's like the wings, she rides all alone
She'll catch the sun, and make it shine forever

But I don't wanna see her crying
And I don't wanna see her fate
Cause you know I love that girl
You know I love that girl

Angelina with her eyes so blue
I can't resist, she gets through to you
The silent talking in a way that burns through your heart
A cold, grey day never appears
Your body's warmed, but innocent tears
When Angelina gives you a friendly start

But I don't wanna see her crying
And I don't wanna see her fate
Cause you know I love that girl
You know I love that girl

But I don't wanna see her crying
And I don't wanna see her fate
Cause you know I love that girl
You know I love that girl

Angelina's going out tonight
Angelina's going out tonight
Angelina's going out tonight
Tonight...
