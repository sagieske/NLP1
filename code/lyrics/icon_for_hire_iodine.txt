Song:

I say I wanna be healthy but I turn up the noise.
And the iv drips a steady stream of poison.
I think I'm just in love with the feeling.
Break my bones so I can feel them healing.

Crazy's I believe the medical term.
When we wanna recover but we don't wanna learn.
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times.
And give me some more of that iodine.

I can't make reality connect,
I'll push 'til I have nothing left.
Bit if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.
I'll run in circles 'til I crash,
One day these steps will be my last.
So if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.

I say I wanna be happy but I quickly forget.
When I sabotage all the good I've got left.
Depression's like a big fur coat.
It's made of dead things but it keeps me warm.

Crazy's I believe the medical term.
When we wanna recover but we don't wanna learn.
Keep breaking what's been fixed a thousand times.
And give me some more of that iodine.

I can't make reality connect,
I'll push 'til I have nothing left.
Bit if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.
I'll run in circles 'til I crash,
One day these steps will be my last.
So if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.

I don't like pain but I bring it to life.
I don't like scars but I'm good with a knife.
I don't like tears but I'm starting to cry
When I realize I'm destroying my life

I do this to myself,
I do this to myself.
Stop blaming someone else,
We do this to ourselves.

I can't make reality connect,
I'll push 'til I have nothing left.
Bit if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.
I'll run in circles 'til I crash,
One day these steps will be my last.
So if we want to wake up
Why we still singing these lullabies.
So if we want to wake up,
Why we still singing these lullabies
(Why we still singing these lullabies)
