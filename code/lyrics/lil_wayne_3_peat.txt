Song:

Yessir!
They can't stop me... Even if they stopped me ha ha ha yea

I'm on it ooh I'm on it I'm so on it and how ever you want it
You can get it tonight hoe
And all night hoe I get the beat from

(Mistro)
A fuckin right hoe
I might go crazy on these n****s I don't give a Moth*****k
Run up in a n***a house and shoot his grandmother up what!
What I don't give a Moth*****k get cha baby kidnapped
And ya baby motherfucked
It's tha Carter 3 b***h better put ya supper up
Holly grove I throw it up like I'm tryna lose my gut
F**k is up beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffeled up for the f**k of it
S**t get on my level you can't get on my level
You gone need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However I'm better if not now than never
Don't you ever fix ya lips unless you bout to suck my d**k
B***h swallow my words taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty spit it back at me
Two more inches I'da been in that casket
According to the doctor I could of died in traffic
Bounce right back on them b*****s like Magic
Abra-cadabra I'm up like Viagra
I just do this s**t for my click like Adam Sandler
I control hip hop and I'ma keep it on my channel
Watch me!
B***h watch me!
B***h watch me!
But they cannot see me like Hitler
It's the New Orleans Nightmare
Money so old it's growin white hair
Young Money baby
Yeah we right here
I'ma make sure we ball till we fall like tears
And mama don't cry
Ya son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah when I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough we did exactly what I say
I told my girl when you f**k me better f**k me good
Cause if another girl could she gon f**k me good
No sittin at the table if you bringin nothin to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothin to it
Yea I got game like Stuart...Scott
Fresh out the espn shop
And when sports in the poppin
E'ery thang stoppin but you can't fool me I know what you watchin
Me!
You watch me
You watch me
Cause I be
Wee-Zy must see T. V.
C3 n***a that's me
And I'm me I'm me
Times three so retreat or suffer defeat
I'm back 3 peat.
