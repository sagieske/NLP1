Written by ugly kid joe

Hey, do you finally see it
Wait, we are there
Fate, refuse to believe it
May, I don't care
Ten outta ten die
Framed, well try to escape it
Safe, it aint fair
Wait, well try to achieve it
May, I don't care
Ten outta ten
Let me sleep, let me sleep
See me struggle and hold on to my soul
Fallen faster and don't know which way Im gonna go
Ten outta ten die
