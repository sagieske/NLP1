Right, right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?

I love when it's all too much
5AM turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on, and
Raise your glass

Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out
(Freak out already)

Can't stop coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now
(It's so f*****g on right now)

Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you a gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on, and
Raise your glass

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on, and
Raise your glass

Oh s**t, my glass is empty
That sucks

So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own

So raise your... Ah, f**k
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be, anything but loud
And nitty gritty dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on, and
Raise your glass

Won't you come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
Just come on and come on, and
Raise your glass
