Song:

Terror above, beautiful as the night
Black butterfly in full flight
Traveling through the void of space
To this long forgotten place

Druids gather at the circle of stones
To worship the ancient ones
In the glow of the dying red sun
Their rites of evil have only just begun

Evil monks fall to their knees
Black colossus, they must not see
Crystal shards drop from inside
Filling circles in their minds

Thirteen maidens awaiting sacrifice
Screaming, naked, they will slowly die
Blood has mingled with crystal drips ice(?)
Open caverns of eternal midnight
