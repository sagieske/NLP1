Song:

With eyes closed tightly,
I march so blindly.
Pretending everything's fine,
'Cause you're there to keep me in line.
I don't want your guidance,
I'll break my silence.
So sick of asking and being denied and now I realise.

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
We were Born To Lead.
We're finally free, no longer following,
We were Born To Lead... We were Born To Lead.

You can't ignore me (you can't ingnore me)
You can't think for me (you can't think for me)
Your world will come crashing down to the ground,
'Cause I figured you out.

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
We were Born To Lead.
We're finally free, no longer following,
We were Born To Lead... We were Born To Lead.

I use to think I'm all alone,
But now I see our numbers grow.
I'm not afraid to break away,
Think on my own

With eyes wide open,
My new life begins.
Without you there to tell me, when, where and how,
And you can't stop me now!

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
We were Born To Lead.
We're finally free, no longer following,
We were Born To Lead... We were Born To Lead.

We're holding the key, to unlock our destiny,
We were Born To Lead
We're finally free, no longer following,
We were Born To Lead.
