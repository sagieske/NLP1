Song:

I don't know what I would do without you
But I don't wanna think about that now
I can't imagine how I lived without you
But I don't have to think about that now
'Cause you're here
And I'm right here with you
And the world as I see it
Is suddenly changing
(suddenly changing)

I don't wanna let this moment fade away
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence
I just wanna fall in love along the way
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence

I don't like the way I was before you
But I don't wanna think about that now
Here I lay my yesterday before you
And I don't have to think about that now
'Cause you're here
And I'm right here with you
And the world as I see it
Is suddenly changing

I don't wanna let this moment fade away
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence
I just wanna fall in love along the way
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence

Now every second matters
Now every second counts
And every day is one more day Lord I can't live without
Without you

I just wanna fall in love along the way
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence
I don't wanna let this moment fade away
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence
I just wanna fall in love along the way
I wanna soak up every single second
In your presence
Yeah

Now every second matters
Now every second matters
Now every second matters
Now every second counts

I just wanna stay
Where you are
And I just wanna live
Where you are
And I don't wanna leave
Where you are
