Song:

I've deceived the lonely
And in the dark I've grown
I now clench the fists of hands to limbs that aren't my own

You have conquered cities
And torched the mighty sea
You may keep yourself afloat but you cannot outswim me.

You play with the wolves,
But you sleep with the bones of the rabbit
I was only a child
It makes no sense.

We've conceived the only true bond we'll ever know,
Learned to shake the limbs of trees to trunks that never grow.

You have conquered cities
And torched the mighty sea
You may keep yourself afloat but you cannot outswim me.

You play with the wolves,
But you sleep with the bones of the rabbit
I was only a child
It makes no sense.
