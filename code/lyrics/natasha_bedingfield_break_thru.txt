Song:

For every taste
For every try
For every tear
That never dried
I need your touch
For you to take
Away the pain

Through every fall
Through every flame
Through every trial
Along the way
I hope you're there
Behind the clouds
Just like the sun

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows until we reach a
Breakthrough
Breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough

I lose my way
I lose my trust
I lose myself
When I lose us
I find my strength
To start again
When you're with me

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows until we reach a
Breakthrough
Breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough

[Ad libs]

I'd climb to the edge of a mountain for you
I'll go to the ends of the world to find you
We'll dance in the shadows until we reach a
Breakthrough
Breakthrough
What we need is a breakthrough
