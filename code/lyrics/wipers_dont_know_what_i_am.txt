Song:

I don't know what I am
So just go put on another sham
What do you do when your always subjected
What do you do when your always neglected
Try to run but there's now way
To find a sanctuary
Do you know what you are
I had the feeling we could go far
What do we do when were always rejected
What we feel when were always suspected
Try to run but there's no where
To find a sanctuary
