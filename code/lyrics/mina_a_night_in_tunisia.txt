Song:

The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright.
The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand.
Words fail to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world ages old.
The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright
