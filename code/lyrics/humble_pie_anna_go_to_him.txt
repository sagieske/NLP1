Song:

Well, now Anna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
Oh, but I, I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go to him
Anna, go to him, Anna
Anna, I want you to know, girl
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him
All of my life I've been searching for a girl
Who's gonna love me like I love you
Oh, but every girl that I ever had
Just broke my heart and left me sad
Won't you tell me what am I, what am I supposed to do
Anna, see I want you to know, girl
That I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him
All of, all of my life I've been searching for a girl
Who's gonna love me like I, like I love you
But every girl that I ever had
Just broke my heart and then left me sad
Won't you tell me what am I supposed to do
Anna, you come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
Oh, but I still love you so
But if he loves you more, go with him
Won't you go with him
Go with him
Won't you go, won't you go
Walk away from me, girl
Can't stand no more
Can't stand no more
