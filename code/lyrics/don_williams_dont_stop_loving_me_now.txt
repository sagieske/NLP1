Song:

I know I'm ready now
To love you like you want me to
I've finally figured out
That I depend on you

I haven't started loving you yet
So don't stop loving me now
Don't do something we'll both regret
Don't stop loving me now

You've seen me running round
Trying to live to fast
I swear I'm slowing down
I know what I want at last

Don't say you're walking out
Now that I've finally changed
My life is turned around
So don't stop loving me now

I know I'm ready now
To love you like you want me to
I've finally figured out
That I depend on you

I haven't started loving you yet
So don't stop loving me now
Don't do something we'll both regret
Don't stop loving me now
Don't stop loving me now
