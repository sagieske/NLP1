Song:

I'm for standin' up, I'm for breakin' free
I don't want fate handed down onto me
Yeah, I'm for movin' on, try another town
Time ain't changin' nothin', take a look around

Oh, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah, the same s**t goes down
Nothing turns around, it's a one story town

She was only seventeen but I held her to her word
Had to push her luck and thought she couldn't burn
No, it didn't hurt me when she had to leave
She had a far away feeling wasn't part of me

Oh, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah, the same s**t goes down
Nothing turns around, it's a one story town

Yeah, I'm lost in a one story town
Where everything's close to the ground
Yeah, the same s**t goes down
Nothing turns around, it's a one story town
