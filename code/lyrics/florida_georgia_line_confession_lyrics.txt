Song:

Rusty barbed wire lines these fields
Cloud of dust behind the wheels
Drifting like my mind into the rearview
Jet trails cutting cross the sky
I'm rolling through the open wide
Searching for a song to drink beer to
And trying to find a place to disappear to

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

Embers in the ashtray glow like memories that won't let go
I'm out here trying to get untangled
In the darkness on the edge of town
A little lost, a little found
Waiting on a call from an angel

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession

I light up the night and let it burn
Lean back and watch the sundown fade
Do what I do and life's a little sideways
I take a sip and say a prayer
Wait for the shoe and start and stare
Off at the headlights on the highway
That guy in the windshield looking back looks just like me
But there's a crack in the reflection
Always moving in the right direction
This is just a moonlight soaked, ring of smoke
Right hand on a cold one confession
