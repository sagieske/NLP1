Song:

Take off work, call in sick
Give me some of that, I give you some of this
Let it all out, I’ma put it all in
Now she on the telephone, telling all out

[Hook]
Oh baby this evening, you know you better let me in
I wanna give you this feeling
That you’ve been missing
But for now we came here to party
And then we going to the after party
You fully loaded, don’t hurt nobody
I hope you got a permit for that body

Little black dress, 6 inch pumps
Girls night out, looking for the fun
You’re not the type to go so hard
But no one knows how drunk you are
Looking at me, looking at you
I know what you wanna do
Girl I want you now and later
Come hop on my elevator
Spread your legs
You’re so dangerous
Hot top, like a smoking gun, na na na
Sexy and when I hold you in my hands
I know that you special
And I don’t wanna let go
Oh baby

[Hook
Oh baby this evening, you know you better let me in
I wanna give you this feeling
That you’ve been missing
But for now we came here to party
And then we going to the after party
You fully loaded, don’t hurt nobody
I hope you got a permit for that body

With you cutie is the only point of view
And out of all those girls in here
I see you
Not the typical, that’s something I can get used to
It’s whatever you want
That’s what we can do
Cause you’re so
You’re so dangerous
Hot top, like a smoking gun, na na na
Sexy and when I hold you in my hands
I know that you special
And I don’t wanna let go

[Hook]
Oh baby this evening, you know you better let me in
I wanna give you this feeling
That you’ve been missing
But for now we came here to party
And then we going to the after party
You fully loaded, don’t hurt nobody
I hope you got a permit for that body

Young verse talking outlandish
Who, make you to talk in your campus
True, now you be walking around fancy
Sex drive in my ride and we’ll need …
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I eat that pussy like a savage
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I eat that pussy like a sandwich
All star game and that’s way above average
You got too much class to be looked at as a bad bitch
You much more, you couture
Cut from your own clothe and boutique stores
One of a kind, so what’s the time
I think back, a waste of time

[Hook]
Oh baby this evening, you know you better let me in
I wanna give you this feeling
That you’ve been missing
But for now we came here to party
And then we going to the after party
You fully loaded, don’t hurt nobody
I hope you got a permit for that body
