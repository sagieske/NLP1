Song:

Do you remember the time? Do you remember the man
Who walked with bare feet on rocks through the hot desert sand?
He didn't own very much because he knew of the weight
Such things could put on your back until you could not walk straight

His simple message was "Love your God with all your mind and soul,

And do unto others, do unto others
If you would like that light to come through
You've got to do unto others like you'd have them do to you. "

He went about doing good because he knew we felt bad
He said "Whatever you need, don't forget to ask Dad."
He loves the ones that are lost, he loves the broke and the lame
He taught the natural law that at our Selves we're the same

He knew that you could wreck somebody's night or you could light up their day

So do unto others, do unto others
If you would like that light to come through
You've got to do unto others like you'd have them do to you

Nobody lights a shining lamp and hides it under a bowl

So do unto others, do unto others
If you would like that light to come through
You've got to do unto others likes you'd have them do to you
