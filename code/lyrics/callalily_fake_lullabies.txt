Song:

Wake up little girl
Daddy's waiting outside
Holding your favorite toy
His eyes are full of joy
He can't wait to see your face
He's craving for that moments sweet embrace
His body starts to shiver
Cause this is the first time you'll see each other but

Everything was an imagination
You were a victim of a fad illusion
There's nothing you can do(2x)

Cause when we close our eyes
We hear more lies
Fake lullabies
Poisoning our minds

Clouds are running faster
As your eyes are getting heavier
Things are not so bright
Cause the moon won't she'd it's light
Merry's not around
I don't know where to be found
But who knows
Maybe in a rainbow

Everything was an imagination
You were a victim of a fad illusion
There's nothing you can do(2x)

Cause when we close our eyes
We hear more lies
Fake lullabies
Poisoning our minds

Wake up little girl
Daddy's gone forever
But who knows
Maybe in a rainbow

Cause when we close our eyes
We hear more lies
Fake lullabies
Poisoning our minds
Cause when we close our eyes
We hear more lies
Fake lullabies
Poisoning our minds
