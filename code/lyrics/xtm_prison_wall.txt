Song:

Your love is like a prison wall
And it's getting higher x3

I get so far and then I fall
I can't get through the wire

Your love is like a prison wall
And it's getting higher
I get so far and then I fall
I can't get through the wire x2

Drop the beat now

Your love is like a prison wall
And it's getting higher x3

I get so far and then I fall
I can't get through the wire

your love is like a prison wall
And it's getting higher
I get so far and then I fall
I can't get through the wire x2

Yeah
