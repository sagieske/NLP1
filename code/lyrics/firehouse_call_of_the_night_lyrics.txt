Call of the Night

When the sun goes down that's when I start my day
On the loose the night time's calling me
Out of control I don't know where to begin
It's on my back it's under my skin
Can't break away it's got a hold on me
Must be the call of the night
The call of the night
When the darkness falls I get back on my feet
Hear it calling children off the street
Out of control I don't know where to begin
It' on my back it's under my skin
Can't break away it's got a hold on me
Must be the call of the night
The call of the night
