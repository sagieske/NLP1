Song:

Intro:
Make the sunrise wake each morning 'till you opened up your eyes
Take the brightest stars at night and write your name across the sky
I wouldn't stop until your world was just the way it should be
But first I'd make you fall in love with me

V1:
If I had a magic lamp to make my wishes to
I wouldn't have to think all I would make each one for you
If I caught a falling star and I could make my dreams come true
I've been dreaming all my life of everything I'd do

Chorus:
Make the sunrise wake each morning 'till you opened up your eyes
Take the brightest stars at night and write your name across the sky
I wouldn't dtop until your world was just the way it should be
But first I'd make you fall in love with me

V2:
Love can make you wish for powers you cannot posses
But all I'd ever use them for is to bring you happiness
Girl I'm so in love with you there's nothing left to say
Accept that I'do anything to make you feel this way
Oohhhhhh I

Chorus x 2:
Make the sunrise wake each morning 'till you opened up your eyes
Take the brightest stars at night and write your name across the sky
I wouldn't dtop until your world was just the way it should be
But first I'd make you fall in love with me
But first I'd make you fall

Chorus:
Make the sunrise wake each morning 'till you opened up your eyes
Take the brightest stars at night and write your name across the sky
I wouldn't dtop until your world was just the way it should be
But first I'd make you fall in love with me
(2 x)but first I'd make you fall
