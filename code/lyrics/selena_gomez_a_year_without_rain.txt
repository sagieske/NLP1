Song:

Oooooooh
Can you feel me,
When I think about you?
With every breath I take.
Every minute,
No matter what I do,
My world is an empty place.
Like I've been wanderin' the desert
For a thousand days.
Ooooh
Don't know if it's a mirage,
But I always see your face.
Baby

I'm missing you so much.
Can't help it, I'm in love.
A day without you is like
A year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how I'll survive.
A day without you is like
A year without rain.
Ooooh
Woooooooooaaahhhhh.

The stars are burning,
I hear your voice in my mind.
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning,
Like the ocean that's running dry.
Catch me I'm falling.
It's like the ground is crumbling
Underneath my feet.
(Won't you save me?)
There's gonna be a monsoon
When you get back to me.
Oooooh, Baby

I missing you so much.
Can't help it, I'm in love.
A day without you is like
A year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how I'll survive.
A day without you is like
A year without rain
Ooohh
Wooooooooaaah...

So let this drought
Come to an end,
And make this desert flower again.
I'm so glad you found me,
Stick around me.
Baby, baby, baby
Ooooooohh
It's a world of wonder,
With you in my life.
So hurry, baby,
Don't waste no more time.
I need you here,
I can't explain.
A day without you
Is like a year without rain.
Oooh

I missing you so much.
Can't help it, I'm in love.
A day without you is like
A year without rain.
I need you by my side,
Don't know how I'll survive.
A day without you is like
A year without rain.
Ooooohh.
Woooooooah.

Oooooooooooooooooooooh
Woooaaaahhh
Ooohhh
