Song:

[Verse 1:]
All her life, she has seen oh the meaner side of me
They took away the prophet's dream
For a prophet on the street
Now she's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

All his life, he's been told he'll be nothing when he's old
All the tears and all the blows
He won't ever let it show, because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

[Chorus:]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)

[Verse 2]
All the hurt, all the lies, all the tears that they cry
When the moment is just right
You'll see fire in their eyes, because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

[Chorus:]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)

Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power

Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power

Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power

[Bridge:]
She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode

She's got a lions in her heart, a fire in his soul
He's a got a beast in his belly, but it's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits, take it blow by blow
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode

[Chorus:]
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)
When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
(Every day, every hour, turn that pain into power)

Oh yeah! Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!

Oh yeah!

Every day, every hour turn the pain into power!

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That's a how a superhero learns to fly
