Song:

At last my dear I fear, 
We lost our way but it’s ok, 
We’ll make it back
When the time arrives

And if you close the door
Just leave the crack
I know you know, 
We’ll make it back
When the time arrives, know, 
I’ll be by your side

I’ll wait the day, 
For some kind of sign
That I’ll obey
Though I’m not doing fine, 
Living in my skin
Without you to get in
Living in my skin
Without you

Until the night, she crush over me like dopamine, 
Until the dawn, she crush over me like dopamine, 

I wreck my brain
For details that remain
And though my memory is a pain
Psycoded all the time
Still sweetness that revised

At last my dear
I fear we lost or way
But it’s ok
We’ll make it back, 
Make it back, 
Make it back, 
Make it back, 

Until the night, she crush over me like dopamine, 
Until the dawn, she crush over me like dopamine, 
Into the flood into the flow, I follow it, you’re going to
Into the flood into the flow, I follow it, you’re going to

Until the night, she crush over me like dopamine, 
Until the dawn, she crush over me like dopamine, 

Like dopamine, 
Like dopamine, 

Into the flood into the flow, I follow it, you’re going to
Into the flood into the flow, I follow it, you’re going to
