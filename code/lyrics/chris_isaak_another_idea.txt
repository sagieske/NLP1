Song:

She never sleeps at night she's quiet but she dreams.
Her mind is racing, she plans, she plots, she schemes.
Another idea.
She takes apart the past and re-writes all her lines.
She's tried to win him back a hundred different times,
She's got another idea.
She keeps waiting, hoping he'll come back some day,
She'll leave me, until she does I can say.
Wait, please don't go,
I've got another idea.
No fun to be the one that love is practiced on,
Why should I leave her she wouldn't know I've gone
I've got another idea.
I'll keep waiting, hoping she'll love me someday,
She'll want me until she does I can say.
Wait, please don't go,
I've got another idea.
