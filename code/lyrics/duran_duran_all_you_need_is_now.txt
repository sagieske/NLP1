Song:

It's all up to you now
Find yourself in the moment
Go directly to the voodoo
Now the channel is open

Lose your head, lose control
You come on delicate and fine
Like a diamond in the mine
Whoa oh! Yeah
When you move into the light
You're the greatest thing alive
Whoa oh!

(Chorus 1)
And you sway in the moon the way you did when you were younger
We told everybody all you need is now
Stay with the music let it play a little longer
You don't need anybody all you need is now

Everybody's gunning
For the vip section
But you're better off a runnin'
In another direction

Let your bones and the floor
Throw a shadow on the vine
But your lashes? Let it shine
Whoa oh! Yeah every moment that arrives
You're the greatest thing alive
Whoa oh!

(Chorus 1)

All you need -all you need is now (x3)

(Chorus 2)
And we will sway in the moon the way we did when we were younger
We told everybody all you need is now
Stay with the music let it play a little longer
You don't need anybody all you need is now

Whoa oh -all you need -all you need is now (x4)
