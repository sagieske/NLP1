Song:

Little bird
Drink the champagne from my lips
Take a flying saucer trip
To the stars in my eyes

Little bird
Sitting on the tip of my tongue
Though you look a bit too young
Could be the stars in my eyes

Your words like butterflies
Dance around my head
Your body like forbidden wine
Spills out of my bed

Hope your Daddy doesn't mind
Hope your Mummy doesn't mind
Hope your Granny doesn't mind
Hope your Grandpa doesn't mind

Little bird
You have got to be eighteen
Or a few years past your teens
Or you are in my eyes

Little bird
If you were born before '92
Then you know just what to do
Rip the stars from my eyes

Your words like butterflies
Dance around my head
Your body like a cherry pie
Spills out of my bed

Hope your Daddy doesn't mind
Hope your Mummy doesn't mind
Hope your Nanna doesn't mind
Hope your Grandpa doesn't mind

Little bird
Brand new galaxies await you
Open up and let me take you
To the stars

Your words like butterflies
Dance around my head
Your body like forbidden wine
Spills out of my bed

Hope your Daddy doesn't mind
Hope your Mummy doesn't mind
Hope your Granny doesn't mind
Hope your Grandpa doesn't mind

Hope your Daddy doesn't mind
Hope your Mummy doesn't mind
Hope your Daddy doesn't mind
Hope your Mummy doesn't mind

Little bird
Little bird
Little bird
