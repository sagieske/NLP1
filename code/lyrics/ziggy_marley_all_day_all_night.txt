Song:

I would never give my love to no one but you babe
I would never give my love to no one but you babe
So Love me forever, I said love me forever
Baby love me not just for pleasure
Love me always and forever
'Cause I love you

It couldn't be better

And I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love

So don't you ever give your love to no one but me babe
Don't you ever give your love to no one but me babe
Tell you this
Is all day and all night , all day all night
Our love needs protection
Our love needs direction
And I love you

Baby now
And I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love
Don't you believe
That I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love

So don't you ever give your love to no one but me babe
'Cause I would never give my love to no one but you babe
So love me forever
Baby love me not just for pleasure
Love me always and forever
And I love you

It couldn't be better
And I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love
Oh don't you believe that I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love
Say you must believe that I'm giving my love to you baby
You got my love

So all day and all night
So all day and all night
Our love needs protection
Our love needs direction
And I love you
