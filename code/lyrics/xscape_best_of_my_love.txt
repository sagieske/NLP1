Song:

You know I'll give you the best
O yes I will my baby

[Verse One (Tamika):]
There ain't a thing that I wouldn't do for you,
Just gimme your wishes, I'll make'em all come true.
I'm wrapped around your finger,
You're every breath I take,
And I'll be right there beside you baby,
Every step of the way.

[Chorus:]
Every second that I'm with you, god I swear I'll love you,
Every minute that you give me baby, I'll give you two.
Every hour that we spend together would not be enough...so,
Everyday I'm gonna give you baby,
The best of my love.

[Verse Two (LaTocha):]
So it's not a problem for me to sacrifice, no,
Cuz everything's better now that you're in my life.
This ring I'll wear forever, it means that we are one,
And no I won't stop, can't stop loving you baby,
Until our time is done.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge (LaTocha):]
Just to be with you is all I ever wanted,
Cause with you by my side,
I know that everything will be alright.
You are the one,
You are the center of my joy,
I want this love we have to last,
Until the end of time.

[Repeat Chorus]

[Break (LaTocha):]
I'll give you the best,
Gonna give you the best,
You know I'm giving you the best of my love
[Repeat x3]

So everyday you know I'm gonna give you the best of my love
