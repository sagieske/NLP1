Beast to en cherry oh, balance is from the swinging roll
There it goes catch the speed and make them all who stereo

Yeah I sound like a savage... Can let it flow
You ain't a big foot you just to get it though
Bet your mamas smoking who plus with the... Rose

But who's to drop in there's no...

Running over mother fuckers see the big truck
Looking dead in the face b***h roll

Disrespecting my family I got big nutz

If I gotta keep go man like a grow man I feel such a baby
Get to cross and I have the best 'cause I feel suffocated
You say run it out mouth 'cause I got your body... Pop your place

Ain't s**t with the gas price 'cause I steal it in the bad life
With my own lane and I'm doing on f**k your name
