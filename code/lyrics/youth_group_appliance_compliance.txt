Song:

There's no comfort in a crowd.
Solidarity's cowed.
The panic bursts in bubbles above the heads of the crowd that are bowed.

The train into the station it ballooned.
Chris De Burgh he crooned.
The people flock to open doors like flies to an open wound.

He's going to move to Athens
To escape their moods and fashions.
(Appliance. Compliance.)
One day he'll be more green,
Won't drink from polystyrene.
(Appliance. Compliance.)

She will leave soon it
All depends on when she's paid off her unit
But she'll never be further from her death than she is now.

She's going to move to Athens
To escape their moods and fashions.
(Appliance. Compliance.)
One day she just won't care,
She will smoke anywhere.
(Appliance. Compliance)

Gonna move to Athens,
Move to Athens.

Polystyrene.
