Song:

There used to be a time when I would call and you'd be there
Now your leavings killing me and the time we spent together
Why can't we tape the picture that is scattered on the floor
I guess there's just no love here anymore
Chorus:
I can't hide from my emotions
Stop old dreams and crush my fears and turn away forever
Ill get by without you now so leave me alone
You wont be there tomorrow
Your love is like an arrow through my heart
I tried everything I could to hold onto that life
But now I see I realized I wasn't always right
Ill take the good and leave the bad and walk out of the door
I guess there's just no love here anymore
Bridge:
With all the tears I cried I should have drowned out all the pain
Ill never go back, never cry, I've got too much to gain
Solo
Chorus
