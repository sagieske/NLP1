Song:

Crawlin' 'cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel
Saw that girl that my swamp bone knew so well
She crawled out of Texas flipped off to Baton Rouge
She got that Gulf Coast sun tan that give a poor boy the blues

Alley-gator
With those hypnotic big green eyes
Alley-gator
She'll make you 'fraid 'em
She'll chew you up, ain't no lie
Yeah yeah yeah

Crawlin' through the weeds with a Louisiana mean-toothed grin
You tell her that you love her, then you better tell her once again
She might scratch your back, rub you with her rack
You better watch out or stand back

Alley-gator
With those hypnotic big green eyes
Alley-gator
She'll make you 'fraid 'em
She'll chew you up, ain't no lie
Listen hear

Alley-gator
With those hypnotic big green eyes
Alley Gator
She'll make you 'fraid 'em
She'll chew you up, ain't no lie
