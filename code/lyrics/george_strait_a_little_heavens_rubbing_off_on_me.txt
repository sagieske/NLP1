Song:

I used to like
Making love then
Getting up
And never having to explain
I've always been free
I never could see me
Draggin' no ball and chain
I like running around
And being tied down
Never was my cup of tea
But since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me

And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking about future plans
And then I get the feeling that the life that I'd been leading ain't all it's cracked
up to be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me

I used like
To spend the night
Sittin' on an old bar stool
Drinkin' wine and killing time
With all over those other fools
But since you took my hand
I think I understand
It ain't the way it outta be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me

And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking about future plans
And then I get the feeling that the life that I'd been leading ain't all it's cracked
up to be
Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me

Since I've been holding an angel
A little heaven's rubbing off on me
