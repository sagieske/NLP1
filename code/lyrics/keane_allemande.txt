Song:

Allemande, where have you gone?
Did I know anything about you?
Many moons have come and gone
They wane so easily without you

All along I said we'd be sorry
Sorry, and so we are
But ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows
And ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows
And ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows you home?
Sorry, sorry, and so we are


Allemande, your face so long
And all my silly hopes hung on you

All along I said we'd be sorry
Sorry, and so we are
And ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows
And ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows
And ain't that the way that
The way that the wind blows you home?
Sorry, sorry, and so we are


Oh, the way that the wind blows you home
Sorry, sorry, and so we are
