Song:

A downward spiral of misery, pain
And defeat
A life in ruins.
Promises made. But only deceit.
Face down. Always spat on, hated,
Despised
Pure human waste
No hope ... No future
The claws of depravity sink deeper
As you're pushed from society
The search for "a life" is no longer
An option
Backs turned, Friends forget
Now place your final bet
Please cross my path and feel my wrath
Deserving victim, now feel the aftermath
Now meet your doom
..Here is your tomb
Don't ask why
Why do I criticize?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes
I am your judge
This is your trial, no sense in denial
I am your judge
Your sentence is death
Inhale the lead on your very last breath
Your executioner, that is I
Say your prayers ... now you die
Don't ask why
Why do I criticize?
You're all that I despise
Now see the rage in my eyes
I wish you could live through me
And feel the way I feel
And daily confront your fears
Never she'd a single tear
It's always been like this
The world fears my labour
None understands (that) I've done
Them a favor
If I could - mass genocide
None spared - None left alive
But it's all too far away
