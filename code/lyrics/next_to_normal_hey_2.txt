Henry:
Hey

Natalie:
Hey

Henry:
So tomorrow's the dance,
It's annoying I know
But let's go.

Natalie:
Not a chance.

Henry:
Let me know you again.

Natalie:
Not right now.

Henry:
Ok, when?
Say wait and I'll wait.

(Overlapping)
Natalie:
It's already too late.
Hey, hey!
Will you listen?
Just shut up and listen.

Henry:
There's no way it's too late.
There's no way
I stayed by your side.

Why do I get denied?

Natalie:
You remind me of me.
And how f****d up I can be.

Henry:
Ok, hey.
Let's start over, clean slate.
I'll come by here at 8.
If you show then we'll go.
If you don't, well we'll see.

Natalie:
You just don't give up.

Henry:
So don't give up on me.

Natalie:
Goodbye, Henry.
