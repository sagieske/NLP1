Song:

(rossi / frost)

I thought it over in a quiet room
What about it, what about the dream
Of the future, looking much better
Wonder what is on the other side
When we get there, if we do make it
Better than it was before

I think about it, would we be the same
Working at it, will we fall again
For the same lines and the same reasons
Would we let them take us for a ride
By the next time and the time after
Won't be any time at all
No there won't be any time at all

Cause all we really wanna do is what we wanna do and do it all the day
But we never ever think about it, life goes on and love gets in the way
Everybody does the same old thing and goes ahead and does it anyway

Write a letter to a magazine
Talk about it, talk about the dream
Of the future, looking much better
Wonder what is on the other side
By the next time and the time after
Won't be any time at all
No there won't be any time at all

Cause all we really wanna do is what we wanna do and do it all the day
But we never ever think about it, life goes on and love gets in the way
All we really wanna do is what we wanna do and do it all the day
But we never ever think about it, life goes on and love gets in the way
All we really wanna do is what we wanna do and do it all the day
But we never ever think about it, life goes on and love gets in the way
