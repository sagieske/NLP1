Song:

You starve your children on neglect
Then feed their bellies with fear (bellies with fear)
Concussion bat to the brain
Witness to a battered mother (battered mother)
[Chorus:]
Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear (no longer will your family fear)
A Gunshot to the head of trepidation (head of trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger
Just look at the scars you make
Your terror makes your kids break (make you kids break)
A broken home just as you were raised
With fist raised up to your children
[Chorus:]
Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
A Gunshot to the head of trepidation
My promise if you ever lay a finger

This battle is on all
You've made beautiful Now hateful
You wretched life wrecker
Abuser

Now suffer
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife we'll strike down the hand (open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made(open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive

Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife we'll strike down the hand
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife we'll strike down the hand
(open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made(open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive
