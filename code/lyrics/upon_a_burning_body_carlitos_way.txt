Song:

I'm hearing every word you say only I'm not listening
I hope you regret this
Attack and destroy the line
Speak the words that you want me to remember and I'll
I'll take them to the death
To the death

This is a payment of society
If you promise there's no forgiving me
Just a precaution for security
I want it all
Yeah!

I must walk on the blood of all humanity
To mark the yard where hope drowned
This is the battleground
Here we go

Now we'll set the tone
You're becoming the sheep and we're the cannibals
This is only a game
As you were bending the rules we built our foundation

You think you're big time?
You're gonna f*****g die big time

Now speak the words you want me to forget to the death
Enjoy the company
I will show you what it is to yearn

We'll shake the f*****g ground
Lets burn this mother down
It shook before and we'll shake it again before we're done

This is my payment to society if you promise there is no forgiving me
Attack, we will set the tone we will take it all back
You're the sheep, we're the cannibals
This is just a f*****g epilogue
We'll shake the f*****g ground
