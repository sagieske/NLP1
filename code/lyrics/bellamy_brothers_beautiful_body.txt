Song:

If I said you have a beautiful Body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel

Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst

Would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said
You have a beautiful Body

Would you hold it against me?

Now
We could talk all night about the weather

Could tell you about my friends out on the coast.
I could ask a lot of crazy questions

Or ask you what I really want to know.

If I said ...

Now
Rain can fall so soft against the window;
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky.
But daddy always told me
Don't make small talk;
He said: "Come on out and say what's on your mind".

So if I said ...

If I said ...

If I said
You have a beautiful body

Would you hold it against me?
