Song:

Do you know them crows
Their feathers black
They standing round
And waiting for your soul
Wait if you lose control

Do you know them wolves
They're smelling blood
They gonna kill you
If you turn your back
You better watch your step

And somewhere in the cold distance
I see a shadow that once was me

Chorus:

Just let me be
Be like myself
I'll never be somebody else
Into the light
Out of the dark
I'll keep on going and follow my heart
Just let me be
Just let me be

Do you know the devil
In disguise
With blood red eyes
Promises everything
If you dance on this string

Do you know that manager
Who smiles
Behind his eyes
He thinks ' bout selling you
Belive in me it's true

Don't be afraid of your resistance
The only chance is to succeed

Chorus:

Just let me be
Be like myself
I'll never be somebody else
Into the light
Out of the dark
I'll keep on going and follow my heart
Just let me be
Just let me be
Just let me be
Be like myself
I'll never be somebody else
Into the light
Out of the dark
I'll keep on going and follow my heart

Can't you see
I'm gonna break free
Just let me be
Just let me be
