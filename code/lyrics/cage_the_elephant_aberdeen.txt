Song:

I've been tryin real hard...
To realize
But somethings take a long long
Long long time (a long time)

[Chorus:]
Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me foamin at the knees
Saw the flame tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeeeen
Way back(x3)

Never saw my dark side
In, in your eyes
Back and forth bloody fingers
Paintin up the sky
The sky

Repeat Chorus (x2)
