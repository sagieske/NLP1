Song:

I was forgotten, until you called my name.
Lost in the shadows, until you shined your light my way.
Now I believe again, in all my dreams again.
I'm wide eyed and innocent,
Those doubting days are so far away and oh,

*Chorus*
I will fall, and you will catch me always,
Time has taught me this.
I will fly, and you'll be there to guide me,
Straight up to my hearts highest wish.
I feel you close to me, and I know what love is.

Now there's no mountain too high for me to climb,
No ocean so wide that I could not reach the other side.
Now I believe in me, cause you live and breathe in me.
And nothing can come between, we are one star,
No night can darken, oh...

*Chorus*
I will fall, and you will catch me always,
Time has taught me this.
I will fly and you'll be there to guide me,
Straight up to my hearts highest wish.
I feel you close to me, and I know what love is.

It's an unspoken thing, a quiet opening.
There are no words that go that deep, but I know, I know.

*Chorus
I will fall and you will catch me always,
Time has taught me this.
I will fly, and you will be there to guide me,
Straight up to my heart's highest wish.
I feel you close to me and I know what love is.
