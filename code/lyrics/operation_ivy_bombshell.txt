Song:

She (she)(she) She's a bombshell
She (she)(she) She's a bombshell
Oh yeah
Down in south oakland
Off east 14th it's raining
Six A. M. On sunday and the bums are praying
Met her at a party we were drunk now were sober
She said it's cold got a long walk home come over
Shes a bombshell
I've retraced my steps a thousand times
Seems I've spent hours asking all my freinds about her
Been six months but I'll never be the same
Nobody remembers her name
Shes a bombshell
