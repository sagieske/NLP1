Song:

You think I love you
Well, baby, you're right
You think I wanna hug you

I wanna love you
I wanna hug you
Cause, I, yeah
I need you so bad, yeah
So, come on, just me and you

I wanna love you
I wanna hug you
Cause I need you so bad
But I can't get you
It makes me so mad

If you think I want you
Well, baby, you're right
If you think I wanna haunt you
Well, baby, you're right

I wanna love you
I wanna hug you
Cause, I, yeah
Just need you and
Everything gonna be alright
Yeah

I wanna love you
I wanna hug you
Cause I'm so bad
When I can't get you
It makes me so mad

Everybody got to believe it

Just me and you, baby
I believe everything will
Be all right one more time, yeah

I wanna love you
I wanna hug you
Cause I need you so bad
But I can't get you
It makes me so mad, yeah

Whoa, yeah
Come on
