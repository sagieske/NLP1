Song:

I am ready, as ready's anybody can be.
I am ready, ready's anybody can be.
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me.
I got a axe-handled pistol on my graveyard frame,
That shoot tombstone bullets, wearin balls and chain,
I'm drinkin tnt, I'm smokin dynamite,
I hope some screwball start a fight.
Cause I'm ready, ready's anybody can be.
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me.
All you pretty little chicks with your curly hair,
I know you feel like I ain't no where,
Well, stop what you're doin, baby, come over here,
I'll prove to you baby, that I ain't no square.
Cause I'm ready, as ready's anybody can be.
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me.
I been drinkin gin like never before,
I feel so good I want you to know.
One more drink, I wish you would,
I takes a whole lotta lovin to make me feel good.
Cause I'm ready, as ready's anybody can be.
I am ready for you, I hope you ready for me.
