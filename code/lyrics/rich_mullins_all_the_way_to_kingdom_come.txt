We didn't know what love was 'til He came
And He gave love a face and He gave love a name
And He gave love away like the sky gives the rain and sun
We were looking for heroes, He came looking for the lost
We were searching for glory, and He showed us a cross
Now we know what love is 'cause He loves us
All the way to kingdom come (All the way)
All the way to kingdom come
Love is a miracle
It's a miracle if you can find it
And miracles are hard to come by these days (these days)
But the sweet Lord Jesus, he's a miracle man
He's got holes in His feet, in His side, in His hands
And if you ask for love, love pours through them
Like a ray of light, like a raging blaze
We didn't know what love was 'til he came
And He gave love a face and He gave love a name
And He gave love away like the sky gives the rain and sun
We were looking for heroes, He came looking for the lost
We were searching for glory, and He showed us a cross
Now we know what love is 'cause He loves us
All the way to kingdom come (All the way)
All the way to kingdom come
Life is a mystery
It's a mystery we're all living
This world is so fragile
And we're so frail, so frail
Yeah, with the sweet Lord Jesus, His mysterious heart
Keeps the life-blood pumping at the center of it all
If He let go of us, we'd all blow apart
But He holds on tight, His love don't fail
We didn't know what love was
We didn't know what love was 'til He came
And He gave love a face and He gave love a name
And He gave love away like the sky gives the rain and sun
We were looking for heroes, He came looking for the lost
We were searching for glory, and He showed us a cross
Now we know what love is 'cause He loves us
All the way to kingdom come (All the way)
All the way to kingdom come
All the way to kingdom come (All the way)
All the way to kingdom come (All the way)
