Song:

Strip down core violate and paralyze
Flood my soul a coffee drag- supersize
Slung low like a whore- yeah
Devil want some more- yeah
Cupid bought a gun- he gonna blow the fucker
Yeah- I want it
Yeah- I need it
Yeah- I love it
Yeah- Electric head in your head
In your head- in you!
Breakneck speed get a violent spinal crack'n
Back down to the chrome and fell the death wish attack'n
Hubcaps on your eyes- yeah
Cannot sympathize- yeah
A fistful of hair and a splinter in the mind
Yeah- I want it
Yeah- I need it
Yeah- I love it
Yeah- Electric head in your head
In your head- in you!
Too far gone see the freak apologize
Flood my soul a coffee drag- yeah
Slung low like a whore- yeah
Cupid bought a gun he's gonna blow the fucker
Yeah- I want it
Yeah- I need it
Yeah- I love it
Yeah- Electric head in your head
In your head- in you!
