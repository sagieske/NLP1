Song:

You cross my mind when I’m sleeping
I dream of you when I wake up
I cross my heart and hope to fly away if I can’t have you
I think of you in the afternoon, when I keep my thoughts to myself
You say that I don’t know you, but I know some thing you don’t

Chorus:
I won’t stop till I have you
(Till you’re mine)
I won’t be just fine
(Till you’re mine)
I won’t sing another f*cking note until you’re mine, all mine, all mine
Until you’re mine, all mine, all mine

Staying up all night, waiting for a likeful compromise
But you’re alright, and you’re just gonna sleep down on the floor
Seeing I can’t close my eyes, cause you’re lying 3 feet to my side
But you’re alright
And you’re just gonna sleep down on the floor, face down
Trying to get some rest

Chorus:
I won’t stop till I have you
(Till you’re mine)
I won’t be just fine
(Till you’re mine)
I won’t sing another f*cking note until you’re mine, all mine, all mine
Until you’re mine, all mine, all mine
I won’t sing another note until you’re mine, all mine, yeah all mine
