Song:

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky-eye
She's 41 and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks 'round brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Lookin for a mysterious dark haired man
In her younger days they called her delta dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
When a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky -eye
Delta dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by
And did I hear you say he was meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky eye
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky eye
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky eye
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a meeting you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky eye
