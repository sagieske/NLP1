(Yeah yeah, oh yeah)

Still got that same look that sets me off.
Guess there's just something about you.
I got these feelings to let it show cause I wouldn't and let you go.
I shouldn't have let you go.

You asked me for closure before and girl I told you it's over, it's over, 
It's not over.
So here we go again.

It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
To the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
Tonight.

I know I tried to not face the truth, but no one can love me like you do.
Your love is static, it pulls me in like a song when it first begins, I
Just don't want to let you end (No)

You just take me over and you are my controller.
I told ya, I told ya, 

I'm ready to go again (Yeah) 

It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
To the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
Tonight.

Baby it's something you did to hold me on.
Maybe there's something that just keeps me from moving on.
The moment I see you, I know it's going to be you, I got this figured out.
(Ooh)

It's like I'm falling in love all over again.
For the first time and I know that it feels right.
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
Love at first sight, do you know how I feel to the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
To the left, left, left.
On the right, right, right.
To the back, back, back
On the side, side, side.
Tonight.

(Ay, ay, ay. All over again, all over again)
(Ay, ay, ay. All over again, all over again yeah)

All over again
