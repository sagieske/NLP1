Song:

When I first saw you standing there,
You know, was a little hard not to stare.
So nervous when I drove you home,
I know, being apart's a little hard to bear.
Sent some flowers to your work, in hopes
That I'd have you in my arms again.
We kissed that night before I left, still
Now it was something I could never forget.

You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I, with you I know that
I'm good for something so let's go and give it
A try. We've got our backs against the ocean,
It's just us against the world. Looking at
All or nothing, babe it's you and I. Looking
At all or nothing, babe it's you and I.

Let's take a chance, go far away, today
And never look back again. Since I
Said I loved you in Las vegas. It's
Never been the same since then.

You've got all that I need

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I, with you I know that
I'm good for something so let's go and give it
A try. We've got our backs against the ocean,
It's just us against the world. Looking at
All or nothing, babe it's you and I. Looking
At all or nothing, babe it's you and I.

This is it, nothing to hide, one more
Kiss, never say goodbye. This is it, baby you're all mine.

Looking at all or nothing, babe it's you and I,
I know that I'm good for something so let's
Go and give it a try. Got our backs
Against the ocean, it's just us against the world

Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I, with you I know that
I'm good for something so let's go and give it
A try. We've got our backs against the ocean,
It's just us against the world. Looking at
All or nothing, babe it's you and I. Looking
At all or nothing, babe it's you and I.

Babe, it's you and I
