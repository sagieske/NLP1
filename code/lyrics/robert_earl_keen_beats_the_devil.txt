Song:

I can't remember when I was here
But I'm back again
I barely know you friend
And everything's changed
Sun burned up
The sky turned green
The air smelled of gasoline
The soldier boy and teenage queen
Have since become estranged

I keep movin'
Like the wind across the sea
What the hell am I doin'
Beats the devil outta me
