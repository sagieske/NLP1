Song:

You are a soldier
A rising sun
Wait for the heyday
Look far away
And believe in yourself
Your name's on a shelf
A legend

You are a soldier
The chosen one
Bring back the heyday
Look far away
With respect and decay
Forever we'll stay
Together

And singing life is all that we need
But the lies is all that we see
Raise your hands high up in the sky
Missing secrets you will find
In your heart (3x)

You are a soldier
Light up the night
We are the soldiers
We'll stand and fight
At the end of the day
Forever we pray
For the legend (the legend)

And singing life is all that we need
But the lies is all that we see
Raise your hands high up in the sky
Missing secrets you will find
In your heart (3x)

And singing life is all that we need
But the lies is all that we see
Raise your hands high up in the sky
Missing secrets you will find

And singing life is all that we need
But the lies is all that we see
Raise your hands high up in the sky
Missing secrets you will find
In your heart (Its in your heart)
