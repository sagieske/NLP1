Well, now my baby's gone
She left me all alone
Well, now my baby, tears fall
I don't have no one home
Ev'ry night so dark and lonely
My heart is heavy, like a stone

Cry, cry, all night
Ooh-ooh-yeah
Well, now little darlin'
Come back home

Yeah-yeah, one time
Come on, little darlin'
Oh, one more time
Come on and say a-you'll be mine
Now that you gone and left me
I'll always have you on my mind

Cry, cry, all night
Ooh-ooh-yeah
Well, now little darlin'
Come back home

(guitar & instrumental)

Well, now little baby
I'm 'onna leave my home cell
I'm gonna try and lose you
From outta my head
And then if I can't lose you
I'm 'onna die in my bed

Cry, cry, all night
Ooh-ooh-yeah
Well, now little darlin'
Come back home.

(short instrumental & guitar to end)
