Song:

She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain
It's all about soul (She's all about soul)
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion
It's all about soul (She's all about soul)
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion
She's got to be strong 'cause so many things gettin' out of control
Should drive her away
Why does she stay?
It's all about soul (Soul)

She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say
It's all about soul (She's all about soul)
It's all about knowin' what someone is feelin'
The woman's got soul (She's all about soul)
The power of love and the power of healin'
This life isn't fair
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold
You gotta get tough but that ain't enough
It's all about soul (Soul)

It's all about soul
Yes it is
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
As she comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul (She's all about soul)
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow
It's all about soul (She's all about soul)
Who's standing now, who's standing tomorrow?
You've got to be hard, as hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll
But that's only part, you know in your heart
It's all about soul (Soul)

It's all about soul
Yes it is
It's all about soul
Yes it is
It's all about soul
Yes it is
