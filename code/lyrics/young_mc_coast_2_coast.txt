Song:

I met a girl named hip hop in seventy eight
Hollis Queens New York gave us our first date
Man she broke me off proper yo the girl was fast
And everybody kept telling me it would not last
Cause ain't no women in the world supposed to be that sweet
And ya just can't trust a hot chick from the street
I could tell she had been through lots of struggle and strife
But yet in still she'd been with me over half of my life
Born key Jeff Taylor took me into his home
And intrduced me to some tables and a microphone
Hip hop talked to me told me take your time
At the age of eleven I bust my first rhyme
Block partys in the day house partys at night
Just about one year before Rapper's Delight
Everybody in the crew called to make a request
Cause rap's on the radio and hip-hop was blessed
Didn't go to many clubs I wasn't old enough
And if it try to sneak it out my folks is scolding up
But I still do anything to get on stage
And once I got a club gig I lied about my age
Just a couple blocks away was the Hollis crew
Run and them used to rock at one ninety two
Up the street was a crew called Solo Sounds
Where Davey D and Mex used to throw it down
Man I wouldn't trade rap for anything in the world
Hip hop meant more to me than diamonds and pearls
And I still reminicse to this very day
And I remember those words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop

Now I gotta get busy time to make that move
High school over with gotta sho' improve
Got college on the coast and I'm makin' plans
So hip hip went and told me go west young man
It was a different kind of style but I liked the sound
Everybody in the house gauranteed to get down
I did the casa skateland word on wheels
And the crazy crazy world of the record deal
K-day was the station that played my song
I got love from the people it's a shame they gone
Julio and Tony G yo was keeping it real
And Baker Boys doin' they own up in Bakersville
I remember other brothers putting out the gin
Like six in the morning and the battle ran
There were boys in the hood and little Nenah Cherry
And oh I can't forget about ooh Rock Berry
Before the madness when I made my fame
Alot of people on the west coast knew my name
Before the big magizines even wanted to meet me
I checked the back pages of the L. A. Weekly
To see if they would write and recognize the sound
Cause in those days Young mc was underground
Lot of times I would rhyme and I'd get no pay
But I remember those words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
West coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
West coast played a role in making a hip hop

Talk of an east coast west coast beef makes me panic
I love both sides so I'm straight skitzafrenic
Got my skills in the east got my deal in the west
So I just can't say what side is the best
Now you love where you live that's true indeed
Cause your family and friends give you what you need
Stand up for yo' hood and you do it with pride
But the media tells you hate the other side
Now it's hard to hate a man that I have not met
Or hate a whole damn coast like a????
Cause hip hop is wit ya no matter where you stay
So remember these words hip hop would say

(Do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
East coast played a role in making a hip hop
(Do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
West coast played a role in making a hip hop
(do you have love for the east coast?)
Yes I do
(the hip hop on the west coast?)
Yeah that's true
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
Both coasts played a role in making hip hop
(do you have love for the west coast?)
Yeah that's right
(the hip hop on the east coast?)
Yeah that's tight
From the 'yes yes y'all' to 'and you don't stop'
Both coasts played a role in making hip hop
(coast to coast)
