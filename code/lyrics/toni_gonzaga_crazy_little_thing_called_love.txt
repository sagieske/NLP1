Song:

If you would ask me to love you
I'll say yes
And if you would ask me to hold you
I'll say yes

[Refrain]
I'll say yes all the time
There's no doubt in my mind
For i've been wishing that day
The day that you would be mine
Oh i'm waiting for my shooting star
To say yes

[Chorus:]
Cos i've been hearing love songs
And I've been wondering what's wrong with me
Since I met you I felt this
Crazy thing called love love love
Crazy little thing called love love love
Crazy little thing called love

If you wud ask me to kiss you
I'll say yes
And if you would ask me to be with you
I'll say yes

[repeat Refrain and Chorus]
