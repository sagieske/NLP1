Song:

Been turning a blind eye for the longest time
Still i see where this is headed
And my mind is going
Should i risk it?

It's all been said and done before
Honestly i'm out of patience
For anymore of your excuses

Refrain:
Kicking and screaming
Inside lies a feeling
One lowly voice
Against a backdrop of noise
Am i on my own?
Tonight i'll let you know

Chorus:
I light the fire
For those of us who wept
For all the heartache that we felt
And this is all we need
This is all i need
I sing along with each and everyone
Beneath the sorrow lies someone
Who's reaching out for a hand
That's reaching too

A common tale if truth be told
Familiar as it seems
My story lies between

Silent and seamless
The sound of my weakness
Is drowned in the noise
Of a world with no voice
And i take it all
Tonight the night will know

(chorus)

Take flight when the nightlight's out of sight
Take flight just go and take the night
Take flight as we share this drink tonight
Take flight it's our flight i fight tonight

Kicking and screaming
Inside lies a feeling
One lowly voice
Against a backdrop of noise
Are we on our own?
Tonight we'll let them know
(we share the sorrow)

(chorus)........you..oooh...

(go, go) take it all
Like there's no tomorrow
(go, go) take it all
We can live forever
