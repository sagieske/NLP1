Song:

From beyond the northern seas
A new winter has begun
I see reasons to be afraid
When the poles reverse the seasons
And the earth is getting cold
Then we know our chance of life is gone

Change this world of ice
Will we ever stop this devastation all around?
Burn this world of lies
Will we live to share this legacy and tell them what we've found?

Watch the lightning hits the sky
Piles of dust growing high
Termination of the human reign
A rain of stones begins to fall
Tidal waves hit the shores
And the final storm will change it all

Change this world of ice
Will we ever stop this devastation all around?
Burn this world of lies
Will we live to share this legacy and tell them what we've found?

And close your eyes and drift away
And keep your dreams of yesterday

Change this world of ice
Will we ever stop this devastation all around?
Burn this world of lies
Will we live to share this legacy and tell them what we've found?...
