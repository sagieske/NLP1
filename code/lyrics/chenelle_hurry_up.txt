Song:

Your Talking
Your Talking So Much I Don't Believe What You Say
If It's Me, Hurry Up
What It Be, Hurry Up
I Been Waiting For You All Night Just To Please
Tear It Up
If Its Really The Rhythm Just Let Me See
And By The Way I Like Em Bigger Than Boys
Don't Dissapoint Me
[Repeat]

Click My Heels And I Blink Two Times
You Getting Only Three Or Four More Seconds Of Mine
And I Wonder Why Your Questions Always Endin In Why
Well It's Just Because That All You Do Is Wastin My Time
Now I Told You How I Feel, That You Got An Appeal
That I Can Somehow See Myself Wantin To Chill With
If You Don't Hit Real Hard Like A Big Speaker,
Than Wait This One Out Cause You Didn't Hurry Up

If It's Me, Hurry Up
What It Be, Hurry Up
I Been Waiting For You All Night Just To Please
Hurry Up, Tear It Up
If Its Really The Rhythm Let Me See
And By The Way I Like Em Bigger Than Boys
Don't Dissapoint Me

All I Feel Is Warm Sensations
And Your Conversation
Just Can't Get Me Babe
Didn't I Tell You Time Was Tickin

[Chorus:]

Now All My Girls Know We Liked Up Ripped Up
If It Doesn't Hurt If He's Chipped Up
You Got A Little Bit Off Both Of Them But Listen
You Didn't Like Hurry I Told You So You Gets None
We Like Em Ripped, We Like Em Ripped, We Like Em Ripped All Up
We Like Em Chipped, We Like Em Chipped, We Like Em Chipped All Up
[?], But You Weren't Listening
Is There Any Boys Around Here Who Can Spitfire

[Chorus:]

All I Feel Is Warm Sensations
And Your Conversation
Just Can't Get Me Babe
Didn't I Tell You Time Was Tickin

[Chorus:]
