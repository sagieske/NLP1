Song:

Here inside your presence
I'm taken by the wonder of You
Here inside your glory
We give our lives fully to You

//We cry holy, holy
Are You//

Your love it burns inside
Our hearts are satisfied by You
Your love is all we want
Is why we ask for more of You

Holy, holy are You
Our hearts are burning
Burning for You
We cry holy, holy are You
Our hearts are burning
Burning for You

We are your burning ones
We are consumed by You
We set our lives apart
We are consumed by You

So let this love be like a fire
Let our lives be like a flame
Feel us souls with Your desire
Let our passion bring You fame
