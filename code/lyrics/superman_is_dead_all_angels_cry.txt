Song:

Can you tell me why, the world is so ugly
And there ain't no pretty pictures everywhere I go
Spend some of your time, and think of the answer
Why must people get so scared most of their life

Now tell me why
Why the angels gonna cry
To see the way we live our lives, where this, the heart goes?
And tell me why
Why the angels gonna cry
I close my eyes and a better place will it come true

Walking down the street, in one bloody cold night
Where everyone is blind, they show you how to feed your hate
Education now, war for tomorrow
And I do believe we're living on a time bomb!
