Song:

Face the fact, there's nowhere to go
I just feel the end of time
Seek the grain of the luck
You must take the chance
They are waiting in the field of the blood
Make your choice, there's no time to wait
Seek the grain of the luck
Now, it's my time

Force in the arena
Force of the agony
Look at the sky
You will see the fire is coming
Force in the arena
Force of mighty
Look at the sky
Now the time to break free

I aim at the top
I'm not afraid to die
No one can stop my striding
It's just my life, it's not a game
I just take the risky way
And I will see the prime
No one can stop my striding
Fight for my life, it's just access to my life

Nothing ventured, nothing gained
You just feel the end of time
Seek the grain of the luck
You must take the chance
Take the glory in the field of the blood
Hunt the gold, there's no time to wait
Seek the grain of the luck
Now, it's my time

Force in the arena
Force of the agony
Look at the sky
You will see the fire is coming
Force in the arena
Force of mighty
Look at the sky
Now the time to break free

I aim at the top
I'm not afraid to die
No one can stop my striding
It's just my life, it's not a game
I just take the risky way
And I will see the prime
No one can stop my striding
Fight for my life, it's just access to my life
