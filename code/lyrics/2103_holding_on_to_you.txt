Song:

[Verse:]: 1 Tell me who control the weather
Tell who knows me better
Tell me who know every string of hair on my body
You... Yeah
If it's he who holds the future
If it's he hold me the ruler
Then I'm not going to look no farther
I'm not going to search no farther
(Vamp): 1
Fix me until I'm broken no more
Feed me until in not hungry
No more
I'm holding
And Holding, and Holding on to you (repeat)
[Verse:]: 2
I'm leaning and holding on to
I'm praying and holding on to you

Oh ni ni ni ni(repeat 4x)
Now tell me who's the master
Now tell me who's the king of king
Now tell me who control the time, wind and the seasons

If it's he who created me
If it's he who died for me
Then I'm not going to look no farther
Then I'm not going to search no farther
(Vamp): 2
Fix me until I'm broken no more
Feed me until, I'm on hungry no more
I'm holding, and holding, and holding on to you(repeat)
(Repeat)Verse: 2) 2x
Repeat Vamp 2
Repeat Vamp 2 at holding
Repeat Verse 2 7x
While Back round singing
Saying I'm holding
Oh god I'm holding, to your pants, to your fist
I'm holding to your blessings
I'm holding and trusting, to your word, and your wisdom, I'm holding and leaning, and I'm fasting and praying
Like Jacob I'm holding,
Like jacob restling
And I wont let go, Until you, bless my soul
I wont let... I wont let
Until you bless my family, Until you save my friends
Increase, increase, increase, my joy
Increase, increase, increase, my joy
Save me
Repeat holding until song ends
