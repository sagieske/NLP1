Song:

In the moon of the fallen leaves (Wovoka)
Appeared one day
He had come of the land of spirit
With the message of prophecy

The flood will come and save you
Next spring when the good times come
From the lake of the pyramids (Wovoka)
Was here to say

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing
Keep on singing, keep on singing for the good times to
Come

Gin, Ricky, Ginny Ricky
Gin, Gin, Gin

On the third day a fire let your spirit be suspended
(Wovoka)
Said Little Kid
From the park of the iron horse they saw (Wovoka)
To the dance of the ghost and say

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing

Keep on singing, keep on singing for the good times to
Come

Gin, Ricky, Ginny Ricky
Gin, Gin, Gin

His power is legend and his teaching's true (Wovoka)
The red and the seads
The beauty of his wisdome is an Indian song (Wovoka)
The property

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing
Keep on singing, keep on singing for the good times to
Come

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing
Keep on singing, keep on singing for the good times to
Come

Our people must dance
Keep on dancing, keep on dancing
Our people must sing
Keep on singing, keep on singing for the good times to
Come
