Song:

You're talkin'
You're talkin' to me
I ain't listenin'
Don't bother me
I'm alone, even with you
I'm alone, so what do I do?

You're tellin'
You're tellin' me
You want diamonds
Don't bother me
I'm alone, even with you
I'm alone, so what do I do?

Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a

You're talkin'
You're talkin' to me
I ain't listenin'
Don't bother me
I'm alone, even with you
I'm alone, so what do I do?

Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a crowd, alone in a crowd
Alone in a crowd, whoa oh oh
