Song:

It's 7 in the morning

You were rolling in the cash
You were rolling in bitches
Yeah, I was rolling in my Lincoln
I was a shitty waitress
And boy, you kinda had me thinkin'
You were making me famous
And I was getting cozy with the thought of giving you kisses.

I was a fresh 18
(I'm bein' such a good girl)
(Get into my world)
You're makin' me phat beats
You're sayin' that you think I got star quality.

Got you stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
You're playing like a song in the back of my head
(Stuck in my head)
How'd you get stuck, stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
Stuck like a song in the back of my head
It's 7 in the mornin'.

Oh, it's 7 in the mornin'
And I'm not even tired
You're voice is spinnin'
Screwin' with my mind
Boy, you've got me wired
Oh, Jimmy put your hands all over me
Like your synthesizer
I got this nasty craving
Need a shot of your tranquilizer.

I was a fresh 18
(I'm bein' such a good girl)
You saw me while I sleep
(Get into my world)
You're makin' me phat beats
(Oh God look at him)
You're sayin' that you think I got star quality.

Got you stuck, stuck in my head (Stuck in my head)
You're playing like a song in the back of my head
(Stuck in my head)
How'd you get stuck, stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
Stuck like a song in the back of my head
It's 7 in the mornin'.

I don't know what's wrong
I'm just not tired
And boy I need a tranquilizer
I want you to come over
Come get inspired
And play me like your synthesizer.
(Play me like your synthesizer)

I was a fresh 18
(I'm bein' such a good girl)
You saw me while I sleep
(Get into my world)
You're makin' me phat beats
(Oh, God look at him)
You're sayin' that you think I got star quality.

Got you stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
You're playing like a song in the back of my head
(Stuck in my head)
How'd you get stuck, stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
Stuck like a song in the back of my head
It's 7 in the mornin'.

Got you stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
You're playing like a song in the back of my head
(Stuck in my head)
How'd you get stuck, stuck, stuck in my head
(Stuck in my head)
Stuck like a song in the back of my head.
