Song:

Suppressing obligations in a row
Anxiety makes you hold this line
Giving up one day a week
Isn't this your f*****g sign?

You actually tell me my future isn't set
I'm not scared by your religious threat

I love my fierceness cause I'm so right
Every time you show your so called light
Down to fire we go
For having own minds
We're not being obedient
Refuse to repeat some old lines
We're not shaped upon fear
If we want it better we'll do it here

Here is your life as it passes by
Unconscious you strample with that one lie
Devoting yourself to one thought
Destroy all freedom for what we've fought

Give birth to terms like equality
Smell of hypocrisy it sickens me
