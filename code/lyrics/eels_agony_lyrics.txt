Song:

Am I gonna be alright?
No, I'm not gonna be alright
Nothin' is alright now
Am I gonna see the sun come up?
Or am I goin' down?
'cause everyday I'm here
All I feel is sheer
Agony

Friends tellin' me
That maybe I need
Some pychiatric help
Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you
Just how to get on with it

I look into the mirror
And all I see is ancient fear
And agony

If I could just remember what it was like
When I was younger
Oh, the joy and happiness
Replaced with hunger

And all I've got to show
For the seeds that didn't grow
Is agony
