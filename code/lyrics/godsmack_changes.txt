Song:

All or nothing
It's sometimes life's between what's undecided
And all for nothing
It seems I'm wasting my time
Don't look down on me
Like I don't know anything that I've been doing
You talk down to me
It's time you take a better look inside

I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes into my way

Bow down to me
Taken your pride and stuff it down inside
Vows are ruined
Losing my faith, losing time
Better off you than me
I just can't stand another day when you're in my way
A long time brewing
It's time you kiss your a** goodbye

I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes into my way

I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes into my way

I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes
I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes
I'm looking for changes
Into my way
Into my way
Into my
