Song:

In every heart
There is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds
Of lover's past
Until a new one comes along

So I would choose
To be with you
Say that choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

And every time I've felt a rose
It seems I've only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
Soon so will you soon I suppose
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
