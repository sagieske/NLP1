Song:

They called it stormy Monday
The Tuesday's just as bad
They called it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad

Wednesday's worse
Right on to Thursday
Both so sad

You know the eagle flies on Friday
Saturday I go out to play, baby
The eagle flies on Friday
Saturday, Saturday I go out to play, babe

Please, listen to me love
Sunday I go to church
And I kneel right down and start to pray
And this is what I tell 'em now, listen now

I'm cryin', Lord, haver mercy, Lord, have mercy on me, yeah
I'm cryin', Lord, haver mercy, Lord, have mercy on me, yeah
Listen love, you know I'm tryin' to find my baby
Won't somebody out there, please help me out now?

Alright, we're gonna do it one more time
Just see, hold on time, yeah

They called it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
They called it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad

Wednesday's worse
Right on to Thursday
