You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)
You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)

It's all in vain... Why don't you come back to me?

Color of the wing and the color of the air
When the think of you why understand your impossible dream
Show me your whisper, your long and low whisper
Do you remember those days? Can you tell me why you're there?

You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)
You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)

You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)
You say, "It's all in vain..." (It's all in vain, it's all in vain...)
I say, "You come back to me..." (Back to me, back to me...)

It's all in vain... Why don't you come back to me?
