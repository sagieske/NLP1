Song:

She abandoned me left out in the cold
No suprises I guess that's how it goes
Sits across from me in a booth in this dive
I contemplate how much more I can survive
But- I'm alive so I should be content
Then tell why the hell my whole world is bent
I was send to make and frustrate the population
Inbetween the alcohol and the copulation

What you callin' it
If you build it I will break it
What's wrong, how you doin'
Naa, save it
Gave a fraction of all I had to give
I guess I hold a grudge beacause you still got my rib, with cha
Beautiful eyes, and scrupulous lies
Now watch this circusclown run around in circles and try
Seems like all I get to eat is Hope
Girl if we got along better we'd be dope

Oh walls, they surround me
Lonliness has found me

And for as much as I complain
I'm lovin' it
And I only mention it so that I can rub it in
Wake up to the sunlike, shake off last night
Check what's left and try to get the rest right
Decision, splitting, headache, lifting
Symptoms, matching,
Mama was afraid of it
Knowledge of self ain't as evil as they made it
Call it what you want
If you build it they will break it
The plain, the truth, there's no substitute
But sometimes she wears a disguise- yes you do
A story teller deals with life not Hope
Girl if we got along better we'd be dope

And that's the sound that a dog will make
When he's just been hit by a car
That's the tone that, hits close to home
When the cocaine outlives the star
That the noise, that disrupts the boys
When the q-ball packs the bowl
And these are the words that disturb the earth
When I walk away with your Hope
