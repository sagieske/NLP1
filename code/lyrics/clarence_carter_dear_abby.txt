Song:

Dear Abby, I'm writing this letter in regards
To my girl who reads your column all the time
And I hope that by printing this letter
Maybe it might change her mind

You see, Abby, she saw me talkin'
To an old girlfriend the other day
And she thought we were trying
To startup an old flame again

Now she won't see me
Or talk to me on the phone
Because she thought we really
Had something going on

You see, Abby, your column has touched many hearts
Help me save this romance from falling apart
Abby, please help me, Abby
Dear Abby, I'm calling on you, Abby

She's the only girl I'd really, really loved
That's what I was trying to explain
When she saw me talking to that girl

Now Abby, I done tried everything
But nothing I try seems to do
That's why I wrote this letter to you
Now Abby, I don't wanna take up too much of your time
But I need you to help me save this romance of mine

You see, Abby, your column has touched many hearts
Help me save this romance from falling apart
Abby, please help me, Abby

And I'm signing, desperate
I won't sign my name
