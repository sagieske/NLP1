Song:

[Verse:]
I see you walking with a halo
Cover it up, yeah, cover it up, my baby
No need to try and be a hero
I've had enough
Yeah, I've had enough, my baby

You got a little bit of Tarzan
Let it all out, yeah let it all out, my baby
You see the thrill is in the chase
I wanna find out, I wanna find out, my baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah, I'm getting bored

[Chorus:]
I'm so sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

[Verse 2:]
You wanna treat me like a lady
Don't even try, no, don't even try
My baby

Ain't gotta say that you need me
Keep it inside, yeah, keep it inside, my baby

I know I sound a little twisted
And maybe I am, or maybe I'm not
But baby
Playing the game is so addictive
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop, my baby

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah, I'm getting bored

[Chorus:]
I'm so sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

[Bridge:]
Yeah
When you put your clothes back on
Something always feels so wrong
Baby, all I'm thinking of
Is I want your dirty love

[Chorus:]
I'm so sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

I'm so sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
