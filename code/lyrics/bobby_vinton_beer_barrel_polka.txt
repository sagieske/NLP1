Lyrics
There's a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom there

Oh, there's music and there's dancing
And a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka
They all get in the swing

Every time they hear that oom papa
Everybody feels so tra la la
They want to throw their cares away
En luk ah vas que va

Then they hear a rumble on the floor
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them sing

Roll out the barrel
We'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel
We've got the blues on the run

Zing boom tararrel
Sing out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel
'Cause the gang's all here

La la la la la...
Hey, hey, hey
La la la la la...
Hey, hey, hey

Now's the time to roll the barrel
'Cause the gang's all here

La la la la la...
Hey, hey, hey
La la la la la...
