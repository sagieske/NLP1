Song:

I'm a road runner honey

Cause the road runner honey
Baby that's all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey
Now I know that, that's true
Move over baby, I'm going to drive
Oh, oh

Cause the road runner honey
Baby that's all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey

Now I can see that it's true
No
Move over baby, I'm going to drive
No

Cause the road runner honey
Baby that's all I am to you
Yeah the road runner honey
Now I can see that, that's true
Move over baby, I'm going to drive
