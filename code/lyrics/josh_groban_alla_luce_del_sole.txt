Song:

Darkness lies outside me, here,
And a bit inside as well...
How absurd is this desert city!

I can't even explain how,
But this is not my dimension,
And my mind gets never comfort,
It is always somewhere else.

But you... Where are you? Where's your voice?
What about me if I don't have you,
If I don't get your help?

Everything will look better,
Under the light that will come from the sun!
This night will be gone,
Darkness will fade out!

Hills will be seen,
I will go on looking for you.

Away from this melancholy,
Envy or rage alike.
I don't want these words anymore
To be here in my heart

But you... Where are you?
Where's your smile
What about me if I don't have you,
If I don't get your love?

Everything will look better,
Under the light that will come from the sun!
This night will be gone,
Darkness will fade out!

And under the light of that sun
I will go on looking for you.

Everything will look better,
Under the light, under the sun,
Silence will die,
People there will feel confused.

And under the light of that sun
I will go on looking for you.
