Song:

Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is neigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I asked Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
And bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And feed us for Heaven to live with Thee there

Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
