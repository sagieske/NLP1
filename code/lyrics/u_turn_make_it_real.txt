Song:

[Intro:]

Tonight its been a year
We met each other here,
Hear I am all alone
As thought of you go on

[Refrain:]
Hear me cryin out to you
You said, never, never
Would I leave
Heres a tear from me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

[Chorus:]
I love you
You didn't feel the same
Though were apart, Youre in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream, you are here
You smile and hold are here
And in my heart ill pretend
That you are here again

(Repeat refrain)
(Repeat chorus)
(Repeat chorus)
