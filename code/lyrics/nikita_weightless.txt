Song:

Weightless
Weightless

I thought for real for right or wrong
I thought that you will keep me strong

I want you more, more than before
It's you
It's you
I find a fall I
And what to find, your love
I need it, on you
I'm ready on you, on you

Baby I'm weightless
Take me up baby I'm weightless
Lift me up higher now
Hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher
Higher
Higher

Come baby take me away, away
I'm weightless
I'm weightless

Long, long time that you put up with me
I can't get it right, but you're still here with me
I feel heavy but you're strong
You're strong

I rest my hand against your window
I lie in bed, I touched your pilow
Imagine that you're standing here

Baby I'm weightless
Take me up
Baby I'm weightless
Lift me up higher now
Hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher
Higher
Higher
Come baby take me away
Away
I'm weightless
Hihi-higher
I'm weightless

All my life I'll be waiting for this moment
Every night all I do is think about it
You should now that you are responsible for the love I feel inside, that's
All you secrifice, love

Oooohhh ohh

Weightless I am
Weightless aaahh

Baby I'm weightless
Take me up
Baby I'm weightless
Lift me up higher now
Hi-hi-higher
Hi-hi-higher
Higher
Higher

Come baby take me away
All my life I'll be waiting for this moment
Every night all I do is think about it
You should now that you are responsible for the love I feel inside, that's
All you secrifice, love

Weightless
Weightless
Oooh oooh
I am weightless
Weightless
I am weightless
Oooh ooh yeahhh
Oooh
Oohoww I'm weightless
