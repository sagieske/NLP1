Song:

If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm 500 miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Away from home, away from home
Lord, I'm 500 miles away from home

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way

This a-way, this a-way
This a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go back home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles...
