Song:

Beyond us, God within us
Revealed, yet we see in part
Transcendent, but so near us
Mystery dwelling within our hearts

Father - Spirit - Son:
Only true God
Exalted, three-in-one
Only true God, only true God

Majestic God above us
Enthroned, yet You wash our feet
Humble, but so holy
All of creation bows when You speak

God of all things
God who saves us
God within us
You are God
