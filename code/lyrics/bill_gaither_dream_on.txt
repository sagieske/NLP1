Song:

When Joseph was a little boy he was driven by his dreams
God spoke to him, told him that He'd chosen him
And when others didn't understand Joseph still believed
And trusted Him, trusted and was willing to

Dream on when the world just doesn't believe
God has promised never to leave him alone
Dream on, follow hope wherever it leads
In the seed of dreams there's promise of the dawn

Dare to listen for the music
Keep on following the star
Morning can't be far
Dream on

There's not a valley deep enough that He can't lead you through
He'll walk with you, walk the roughest roads with you
No mountain ever rose so high that you can't climb with Him
And stand up tall, stand and look down on it all

Dream on when the world just doesn't believe
God has promised never to leave you alone
Dream on, follow hope wherever it leads
For in the seed of dreams there's promise of the dawn

Dare to listen for the music
Keep on following the star
Morning can't be far
Dream on

Dare to listen for the music
Keep on following the star
Morning can't be far
Dream on, dream on, dream on
