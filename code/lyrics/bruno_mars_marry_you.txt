Song:

It's a beautiful night, 
We're looking for something dumb to do 
Hey baby 
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes? 
Or is it this dancing juice? 
Who cares baby 
I think I wanna marry you

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can go
No one will know
Oh come on girl 
Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah 
And we'll go, go, go, go-go 
If you're ready, like I'm ready

Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes? 
Or is it this dancing juice? 
Who cares baby 
I think I wanna marry you

I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oooh 
So whatcha wanna do? 
Let's just run girl

If we wake up and you wanna break up that's cool
No, I won't blame you 
It was fun girl

Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go 
If you're ready, like I'm ready 

Cause it's a beautiful night, 
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I wanna marry you. 

Is it the look in your eyes? 
Or is it this dancing juice? 
Who cares baby, 
I think I wanna marry you. 

Just say I do, 
Tell me right now baby, 
Tell me right now baby, baby. [x2]

Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby 
I think I wanna marry you

Is it the look in your eyes? 
Or is it this dancing juice? 
Who cares baby 
I think I wanna marry you
