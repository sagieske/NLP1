Song:

If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living
Why should I guess your size, a choice I've been given
Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming
I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing

When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame

As long as you say I'm free
Then keep these chains off me
Tell me down is up
I'll let you fill this broken cup
When the world fall down
Let them fall on me
Cause no one's around who believe me

When the world casts me down and says I've changed
I'll survive on all the promises you made to me
Guess there's no one to blame
When all you're living on is bread of shame
Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame

Tell me where I sign my name
Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind
Only bread of shame
Tell me where I sign my name
Inside I have no peace of mind
Only bread of shame

Bread of Shame
When the world says I've changed
Bread of Shame
Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame
