Song:

All I need
Is right here on my sleeve
You get what you get with me, girl
You get the grace and the stain
Count to three and I'll be on my knees
Tryin' to set you free, girl
Tryin' hard to make you see

My love is here to stay
My love is here to stay
Open your heart
You can find your own way
I found they're all the same
My love is here to stay

All I need
Is witherin' on that dream
The fruit of all knowledge, darlin'
The one you were supposed to give to me
Now I sit here
Like a buddha in this chair
Watchin' your spectacle unfold
I'm sorry, I don't mean to stare

But baby, my love is here to stay
My love is here to stay
Open your heart
You can find your own way
I found they're all the same
My love is here to stay, yeah

Like the sun that shines behind the mind
Like the one before all days go by
Like the sun that shines behind our
Like the sun that shines behind the mind

Oh, it shines
Oh, how it shines

All I need
Is right here on my sleeve
You get what you get with me, girl
