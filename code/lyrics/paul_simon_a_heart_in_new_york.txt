Song:

New York -- to that tall skyline I come 
Flyin' in from London to your door 
New York -- lookin' down on Central Park 
Where they say you should not wander after dark 

New York -- like a scene from all those movies 
But you're real enough to me, for there's a heart 
A heart that lives in New York 

A heart in New York arose on the street 
I write my song to that city heartbeat 
A heart in New York -- the love in her eyes 
An open door and a friend for the night 

New York -- you got money on your mind 
And my words won't make a dime's worth of difference 
So here's to you, New York
