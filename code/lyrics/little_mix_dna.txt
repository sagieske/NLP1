Song:

[Perrie Louise Edwards]
Does he tell you he loves you when you least expect it?
Does he flutter your heart when he kisses your neck?
No scientist, or biology
It's obvious, when he's holding me
It's only natural that I'm so affected

[Jade Thirlwall]
And my heart won't beat again
If I can't feel him in my veins
No need to question, I already know

[All]
It's in his dna
D-d-d-dna
It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away
B-b-breath away
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man
Not hard to understand
Perfect in every way
I see it in his face
Nothing more to say
It's in his d-d-d-dna

[Jesy Nelson]
It's the blue in his eyes that helps me see the future
Fingerprints that leave me covered for days, yeah hey yeah
Now I don't have any first degree
But I know, what he does to me
No need to work it out, it's so familiar
Ohhhh

[Jade Thirlwall]
And my heart won't beat again
If I can't feel him in my veins
No need to question, I already know

[All]
It's in his dna, D-d-d-dna
It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away, B-b-breath away
I feel it every day, and that's what makes a man
Not hard to understand
Perfect in every way
I see it in his face
Nothing more to say
It's in his d-d-d-dna

[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips
Our energy connects, it's simple genetics
I'm the X to his Y
It's the colour of his eyes
He can do no wrong
No he don't need to try
Made from the best
He passes all the tests
Got my heart beating fast
It's cardiac arrest
He's from a different strain
That science can't expalin
I guess that's how he's made
In his d-d-d-dna

[All]
It's in his dna, D-d-d-dna
It's in his dna
And he just takes my breath away, B-b-breath away
I feel it every day,
And that's what makes a man (what makes a man)
Not hard to understand (to understand)
Perfect in every way (in every way)
I see it in his face (in his face)
Nothing more to say (nothing more to say)
It's in his d-d-d-dna
