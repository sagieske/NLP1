Song:

Unaccustomed as I am to getting married
I am taking this occasion here to say
That me and Adelaide are finally naming the day
Though she knows deep in her heart
I'm a phoney and I'm a fake

She wants five children to start
Five's a difficult point to make
But Adelaide, Adelaide, ever-loving Adelaide
Is taking a chance on me, taking a chance

I'll be respectable and nice
Give up cards and dice
And go for shoes and rice
So gentlemen, deal me out
Do not try to feel me out

I got no more evenings free
(You may scratch me)
Since Adelaide, Adelaide, ever loving Adelaide
Is taking a chance
(Talk about your long shots)
Taking a chance on me

Let's shoot craps
