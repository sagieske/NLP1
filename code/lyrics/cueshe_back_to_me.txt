Song:

Sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
Wondering of what have I done wrong
Maybe I'm just
Missing you all along
When will you be coming home
Back to me

There were times
I felt like giving up
Haunted by memories
I can't give up
Wish that I never let you go
And slip away
Had enough reasons
For you to stay

[chorus]
Can you feel me
See me falling away
(See me falling away)
Did you hear me,
I'm calling out your name
(I'm calling out your name)
Cause I'm barely hanging on
Baby, you need to come home
Back to me

[instrumental]

Sleepless nights
Cause you're not here by my side
Cold as ice
I feel deep down inside
Maybe I'm just missing you all along
When will you be coming home

[repeat chorus]

When will you be coming home
Back to me
