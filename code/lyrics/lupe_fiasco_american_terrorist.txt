Song:

Close your mind
Close your eyes
See with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more than the blood of a martyr

We came through the storm nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the pentagon lawn
Wake up the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a W. Virginia farm
Shorty aint learned to walk already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflouged torahs, bibles and glorious qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpreted, reasons for warfare
We read em with blind eyes I guarantee you there's more there
The rich must be blind b/c they didn't see the poor there
Need to open up a park, just close 10 schools
We don't need em
Can you please call the fire department they're down here marchin for freedom
Burn down their tv's, turn their tv's on to teach em

[Chorus:]
The more money that they make, they more money that they make, the better, the better they live
Whstever they wanna take, whatever they wannna take, whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn, the more that you try to learn, the better, the better it gets
American Terrorist

Now the poor klu klux man c that we're all brothers not b/c things are the same b/c we lack the same
Color that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running give you the jitters?
Just imagine a American-based christian orginization planning to poison water supplies to bring the
Second-coming quicker
N***a they aint livin properly
Break em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give em coca-cola for their property
Give em gum, give em guns, get em young, giv em fun
If they aint givin it up, then they aint gettin none and don't giv em all naw, man, just give em some its
The paper, then these cops must be al-qaeda

[Chorus (2X)]

It's like
Don't give the black man food, give red man liquor
Red man fool, black man n***a
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builda
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river give black man crack, glocks to teens, give red man
Craps, slot machines...
