Verse 1 Fergie:
I ain’t got time for you baby
Either you’re mine, or you’re not
Make up your mind sweet baby
Right here, right now’s all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

All these diamonds, trips around the world
Don’t mean a thing if I ain’t your girl
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

Q-Tip
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
Glad that you made it, look around
You don’t see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands, 
And the room’s a bust
At the end of the night maybe you’ll find love
Fake chit chat ’bout the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize I’m your man

Fergie:
Can the people get loud, underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this pic
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I’m breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I’m the bee's knees

It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart, 
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes, 
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart, 
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes, 
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh

Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got

What do you think GoonRock?
Are you ready?

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
