Song:

I'm so lost,
In love,
With no rhythm or rhyme

I'm starstruck,
I'm so stuck,
With no sense of time

I fall apart,
When you're gone,
I think I need your love,
Just pull me right back to start.
I don't know what this could be,
So lost in your mystery.

Caught up in your gravity,
Dunno how you got such a hold on me.
Caught up in your gravity,
You know I never want you to set me free.

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity.

It's just you,
You're all I need,
To keep my heart tied.

When you're here,
I wouldn't fly away,
Oh no I won't even try.

We fall apart,
When you're gone,
I think that I need your love,
Just pull me right back to start,
I don't know what this could be,
So caught up in your mystery.

Caught up in your gravity,
Dunno how you got such a hold on me.
Caught up in your gravity,
You know I want you to set me free.

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity.

There's no way to stop this attraction,
'Cause baby you're my satisfaction.
If you disappear,
It's like the world will fall.
I will lose control,
So never let me go.
Never let me go.
Ooo Oo

Not even a flight through the galaxy,
Could ever keep me away.

Caught up in your gravity,
Dunno how you got such a hold on me.
Caught up in your gravity,
You know I never want you to set me free.

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity,

Caught up in your gravity.
