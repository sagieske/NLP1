Song:

Know you see me sitting on the cloud high
Fresh up out the kitchen
Broke that b***h right on the counter top
Me and mary jane, bloody mary's in the mirror
Say my name three times, I'll be there with that killer

Can you smell what we smoking on
Let me break it down, nugget size of a poke-ball
Doctor green thumb
Swear just one pick up have your fingers
Feeling like the back side of a sticker

Only rolling bom bom, need a swisher
Shawty says she got a pom pom
She ain't right now, girl it don't matter to me
No substraction, tell 'em I'ma add it baby, Eghh!

It feels like I'm in a daze, my mind in a haze
You can see it in my ways ugh
But we do this everyday, anybody got a problem wit it
You know what I'm saying agh

Roll up roll up roll up roll up roll up

Get right to it, you ain't even gotta ask
You know what the f**k I'm doing

I roll it like a diploma, high up
Trying not to fall in a kush coma
Yeah
Second hand smoke, just from the aroma
Yeah!
Smell that loud n****s telling me to tone it down
Ugh got a n***a barely moving
Stoned like I've been eye f*****g with madusa
Right to the medulla, Not as in a cuban
But it make your blunt look skinny like a quetip
We blowing up bombs
So just relax, sit back and cuff your time
You're looking for the light, I got it like tron
Ain't nobody else on the level that I'm on

It feels like I'm in a daze, my mind in a haze
You can see it in my ways, ugh
But we do this everyday, anybody got a problem wit it
You know what I'm saying agh

Roll up roll up roll up roll up roll up

Get right to it, you ain't even gotta ask
You know what the f**k I'm doing.
