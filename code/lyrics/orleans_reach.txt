Song:

Sometimes
I stop and wonder
Why can't I let myself enjoy
The space I'm in
And all the wonderful places I've been

My arms around the future
And I can think about the past
My aspirations always exceed
My grasp

You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey
Whoa whoa
You've got to grow
Sometimes
Know that you've got to reach
A little bit higher (little bit higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old
Mmm no no no

When the habits of a lifetime
Become a painful cage
You want to break out
But you don't know how to change
No no
Well you may have a vision
Or you may have a friend
Who will come to you (come to you)
And say these same words again (yeah again again again yeah yeah yeah)

You got to reach
A little bit higher
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow
Sometimes I sit myself down and I say
You got to reach (you got to reach)
A little bit higher (higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire
Stretch your soul (oh)
And you'll never grow old
Never never never grow old

You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow
Gonna find out
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
To get a hold on all that you desire (hey)
Stretch your soul
And you'll never grow old (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher (a little bit higher)
When the light within becomes a fire
Hey hey (hey hey)
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa)
You've got to grow (you've got to grow you got to grow you got to grow you got to grow)
You've got to reach (you've got to reach)
A little bit higher
To get a hold on all that you desire
