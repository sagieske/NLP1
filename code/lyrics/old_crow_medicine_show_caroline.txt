Song:

They say you were born in St. Clare's Hospital
I say you were born up in the sky
You come floatin' down over New Orleans
To the sweet green levee on the riverside

And your voice chirped like old squeaky shoes
And mama always said we had nothin' to lose
And so we danced on the street corner

Oh Caroline
Heartbroken hard times, they never got us down
Walkin' the same line through every single southern town
Hand-in-hand, your arm 'round mine
Oh Caroline

Oh Caroline
Seen it all changin', watch it change some more
Seen hard times standin' right outside your door
Tell me gal, what's on your mind
Oh Caroline

We were the Cardinals' biggest fans
Turnin' flips like Ozzy Smith all through the night
Till we got traded away
To the red clay southern league up on the Georgia line

You'd be the pitcher and the catcher too
I'm the homerun king for his muscles grew
Gonna knock the cover off this time

Oh Caroline
Heartbroken hard times, they never got us down
Walkin' the same line through every single southern town
Hand-in-hand, your arm 'round mine
Oh Caroline

Oh Caroline
Seen it all changin', and watch it change some more
Seen hard times standin' right outside your door
Tell me gal what's on your mind
Oh Caroline

These are different days
And the pace of the world has us thinkin' there's no time
To turn the other way
Take my hand, we'll walk on down the line

Though we may be a thousand miles apart
A brother and a sister have a single heart
And the beat don't stop for nothin'

Oh Caroline
Heartbroken hard times, they never got us down
Walkin' the same line through every single southern town
Hand-in-hand, your arm round mine
Oh Caroline

Oh Caroline
I seen it all changin', watch it change some more
Seen hard times standin' right outside your door
Tell me gal what's on your mind
Oh Caroline

Oh Caroline, Oh Caroline
Oh Caroline, Oh Caroline
Oh Caroline, Oh Caroline
