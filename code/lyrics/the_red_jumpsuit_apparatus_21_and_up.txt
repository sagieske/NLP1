Song:

Spun out in another bathroom stall
I tried to read all the writing on the wall
It would help if I could just see straight
I better make last call before it's too late
It's Friday anyway and I,

I'm doing this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
I carry this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
Until, the next Friday begins

Bartender tries to kick us out
There goes your tip Buddy, I shout
Can't drive so I think I'll call a cab
Drunk dialed again oh s**t my bill
It's Friday anyway and I,

I'm doing this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
I carry this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
Until, the next Friday begins

I'm spinning out
But are you still with me
I'm spinning out
But are you still with me
I'm spinning out

I'm doing this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
I carry this with all my friends
I hope this night will never end
Until, the next Friday begins

I'm spinning out
But are you still with me
I'm spinning out
But are you still with me
I'm spinning out
