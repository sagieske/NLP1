Song:

I really miss your blueberry pancakes
I don't buy maple syrup in Asda no more
Sunday morning cooking em up
Wearing my t-shirt, I'm lifting it up

And now I'm in the Holly Bush baby, the Holly Bush
The Holly Bush baby
Sitting at the table where it all began for us...

And everything else is momentary and
Everything else just stops

I'll have another pint of Stella please Brooke
And I remember before this place was so cool and so full and
I remember you wearing a yellow t-shirt
And you had a friend, I was dying to meet her and we did
Back in the day

And now I'm in the Holly Bush baby, the Holly Bush
The Holly Bush baby
Sitting at the table where it all began for us...

And everything else is momentary and
Everything else just stops

Everyone else is secondary
Everyone else is temporary
And I read into the letter that is filled with beauty
The beauty of what was, what is, and what won't be

Sitting at the table where it all began for us...
Sitting at the table where it all began for us...
Sitting at the table where it all began for us...
Sitting at the table where it all began for us...
