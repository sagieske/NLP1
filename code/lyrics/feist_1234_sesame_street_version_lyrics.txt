Song:

One, two, three, four
Monsters walking ‘cross the floor
I love counting
Counting to the number four

Oh you’re counting
Counting with me
To one less than five
And one more than three

Oh, we’re counting to four
Oh, let’s count some more

One, two, three, four
Penguins that went by the door
I love counting
Counting to the number four

I see four here
I see four there
My favorite number
Nothing can compare

Oh, we’re counting to four
Oh, let’s count some more

One, two, three, four
Chickens just back from the shore
I love counting
Counting to the number four

Oh, we’re counting to four
Oh, let’s count some more

One, two, three, four
Chickens just back from the shore
One, two, three, four
Penguins that went by the door

One, two, three, four
Monsters walking ‘cross the floor

Counting to four
Counting to four
Counting to four
Counting to four
