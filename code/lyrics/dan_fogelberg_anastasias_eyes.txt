Song:

There's thorns on the cactus tree
There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows
They tear at the flesh until
The tears start to rise
They form in my heart
But they fall from anastasia's eyes

And I was lost in the wilderness
Without courage or hope
I was setting my signal fires
And watching the smoke
When out of the smoke appeared
The sweetest surprise
And I knew I'd been found
When first I looked into anastasia's eyes

There's thorns on the cactus tree
There's thorns on the rose
There's thorns in the heart of me
That nobody knows

But finally I've found out where my salvation lies
It lies in the love that lives in anastasia's eyes
It lies in the love that lives in anastasia's eyes
