Song:

You could be happy and I won't know
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go.

And all the things that I wish I had not said,
Are played in loops till it's madness in my head.

Is it too late to remind you how we were?
But not our last days of silent screaming blur.

Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should've stopped you from walking out the door.

You could be happy I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far

Somehow everything I own, smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true.

Do the things that you always wanted to
Without me there to hold you back, don't think just do

More than anything I want to see you girl
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
