Song:

Won't you be my number two
Me and number one are through
There won't be too much to do
Just smile when I feel blue

And there's not much left of me
What you get is what you see
Is it worth the energy
I leave it up to you

And if you've got something to say to me
Don't try to lay your funny ways on me
I know that it's really not fair of me
But my heart's seen too much action

And every time I look at you
You'll be who I want you to
And I'll do what I can do
To make a dream or two come true
If you'll be my
If you'll be my number two
