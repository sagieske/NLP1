Song:

She see's the world through tv screens,
All of her friends in magazines,
But everyday she lives a broken dream,
Yeah making her own reality.

There's lots of make up on her face,
You cover up an empty space,
But there's a lot behind those big blue eyes,
She just don't realize.

Everybody's gone and lost there minds,
It's just the day we live in most of the time.
Get up out the dark,
Open your eyes,
Your discover there's a world outside.

To fix a broken heart,
You have to try,
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life, beautiful life,
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.

He got his fortune on a plate,
But all that money won't change fate.
He's got six zero's but no one to share it with,
No friends, no girl, no one in the world.

Everybody's gone and lost there minds,
It's just the day we live in most of the time.
Get up out the dark (get up out the dark),
Open your eyes,
Your discover there's a world outside.

To fix a broken heart,
You have to try,
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life, beautiful life,
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.

We're not that different,
You and I because everybody's got a place to hide,
It's just the day we live in, ooo most of the time.
Get up out the dark (get up out the dark),
Open your eyes,
Your discover there's a world outside.

To fix a broken heart,
You have to try,
Pick it up, pick it up.
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life, beautiful life,
It's a beautiful life, beautiful life.
Beautiful life.
