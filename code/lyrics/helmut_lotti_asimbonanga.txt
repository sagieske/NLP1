Song:

Asimbonanga bonangum Mandela thina
Laph' ekhona laph' echleli khona
(We have not seen him. We have not seen Mandela where he is
In the place where he sits)

Oh the sea is cold and the sky is grey
Look across the island into the bay
We are all islands till comes the day
We cross the burning water

Asimbonanga bonangum Mandela thina
Laph' ekhona laph' echleli khona

A seagull wings across the sea
Broken silence is what I dream
Who has the words to close the this tance
Between you and me

Asimbonanga bonangum Mandela thina
Laph' ekhona laph' echleli khona
Asimbonanga bonangum Mandela thina
Laph' ekhona laph' echleli khona
