[3LW:]
[Chorus:]
You think you know me but you have no idea
Act like you bout it
Well lemme put this in your ear
If you really bout it
Do it like a pose like you don't care
If you bout it
I don't doubt it
Show me that you sure bout it (bout it)

[Yung Joc:]
I'll get your mind off ties
Cause the hustla don't stop
If your girl don't chew then my name ain't Joc
The money don't flip then the block ain't hot
If she don't scream your name then your game just shot
I gotta couple reasons you can call me the boss
Il'l drop a couple stacks and watch your a** get lost
Joc the real s**t Shorty bes believe that
If you ain't ride till die
Bring them car keys back
Take your foot off the brake
Baby gon ride out
If them suckas wanna hate Put um in time out
I get that cake you'll soon find out
If you ever cross me you'll get crossed out

[3LW:]
I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll
Come and catch up with me baby don't stop
Get to the floor whatchu waiting for
Cause we can ride b straight to the top
Wayy too long and now it's the time to show um all that is not a game
Cause I don't care what I'm lookin like
I just wanna show you that I'm not goin no where

[Chorus:]
You think you know me but you have no idea
Act like you bout it
Well lemme put this in your ear
If you really bout it
Do it like a pose like you don't care
If you bout it
I don't doubt it
Show me that you sure bout it (bout it)

[Yung Joc:]
Imma get rich and imma die tryin'
I ain't 50 Cent but respect my mind
Respect my gansgsta respect my shine
Put your click in chick if you step outta line
I ain't Kanye but I been thru the wire
Couple more albums before I retire
Most of these rappers ain't nothin but liars
How are they The Killers when they sing in the choir?
Straight from the bottom and I'm tryin' to get higher
Too many strikes, Got too many priors
Messin with us like playin with fire
Get your wick split, time to meet your messiah

[3LW:]
I've seen it before in a rhyme and a roll
Come and catch up with me baby don't stop
Get to the floor whatchu waiting for
Cause we can ride b straight to the top
Wayy too long and now it's the time to show um all that is not a game
Cause I don't care what I'm lookin like
I just wanna show you that I'm not goin no where

[Chorus:]
You think you know me but you have no idea
Act like you bout it
Well lemme put this in your ear
If you really bout it
Do it like a pose like you don't care
If you bout it
I don't doubt it
Show me that you sure bout it (bout it)

Now I been walking up this road tryin' to find which way to go
Tryin' to pull my faith
Sometimes it seems like I don't know
Now I gotta chance to touch?
And the answers right in front of me
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

[Chorus:]
You think you know me but you have no idea
Act like you bout it
Well lemme put this in your ear
If you really bout it
Do it like a pose like you don't care
If you bout it
I don't doubt it
Show me that you sure bout it (bout it)

[Chorus:]
You think you know me but you have no idea (No Idea!)
Act like you bout it
Well lemme put this in your ear
If you really bout it
Do it like a pose like you don't care
If you bout it
I don't doubt it
Show me that you sure bout it (bout it)
