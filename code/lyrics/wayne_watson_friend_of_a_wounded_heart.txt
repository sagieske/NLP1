Song:

Claire Cloninger and Wayne Watson
Smile--Make 'em think you're happy
Lie--And say that things are fine
And hide that empty longing that you feel
Don't ever show it
Just keep your heart concealed
Why--Are the days so lonely
Where can a heart go free
And who will dry the tears that no one's seen
There must be someone
To share your silent dreams
Chorus
Caught like a leaf in the wind
Lookin' for a friend--Where can you turn
Whisper the words of a prayer--And you'll find Him there
Arms open wide--Love in His eyes
Jesus--He meets you where you are
Jesus--He heals you secret scars
All the love you're longing for is
Jesus--The friend of a wounded heart
Repeat Chorus
