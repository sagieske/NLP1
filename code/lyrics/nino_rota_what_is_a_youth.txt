Song:

What is a youth?
Impetuous fire.
What is a maid?
Ice and desire.
The world wags on

A rose will bloom,
It then will fade
So does a youth.
So does the fairest maid.

Comes a time when one sweet smile
Has it's season for awhile
Then Love's in love with me

Some may think only to marry.
Others will tease and tarry.
Mine is the very best parry,
Cupid he rules us all.

Caper the caper; sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall,
Love is a pass-time that never will pall.
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall,
Cupid he rules us all.

(20 second flute interlude)

A rose will bloom, it then will fade.
So does a youth.
So does the fairest maid.
