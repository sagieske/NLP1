Song:

I've got another confession to make
So complicated let me try to explain
Don't want this feeling to go away
So it stays (It stays)
(It stays) (It stays)

Is it the way that you talk
That's causing me to freak
Is it the way that you laugh
That's making my heart beat
Is it the way that you kiss
It's gotta be the way that you taste
(You taste) (You taste) (You taste)

You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new, Yeah
We resurrect, It's like I've come back to life

I feel so alive, I feel so alive!

First impressions are hard to erase
It's in my mind and just won't go away
Maybe I'm playing my cards way too safe
I've gotta change (Change) (Change) (Change)

Is it the way that you feel against my body
Is it the way that you act, so damn naughty
Is it the way that you shake
When your hips move to the bass
(The bass) (The bass) (The bass)

You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new, Yeah
We resurrect, It's like I've come back to life

I feel so alive, I feel so alive...

[Solo]

(I feel so alive)

You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits never seem to go away
You make me feel brand new, Yeah
We resurrect, It's like I've come back to life

You're such a gorgeous nightmare
Old habits, Don't go away!
You make me feel brand new, Yeah
We resurrect, It's like I've come back to life

I feel so alive, I feel so alive,
I feel so alive, I feel so alive
