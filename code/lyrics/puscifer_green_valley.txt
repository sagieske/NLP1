Song:

Hello stranger,
Can you tell us where you've been?
More importantly,
How ever did you come to be here?
Though a stranger,
You can rest here for a while.
But save your energy,
Your journey here is far from over.
Come the sunrise,
We'll descend through Judgement Valley
And weigh your worth
Before her majesty, the Verde River.

No direction but to follow what you know,
No direction but a faith in her decision,
No direction but to never fight her flow,
No direction but to trust the final destination.
You're a stranger til she whispers you can stay.
You're a stranger til she whispers that your journey's over.

Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.

No direction but to follow what you know,
No direction but a faith in her decision,
No direction but to never fight her flow,
No direction but to trust the final destination.
You're a stranger til she whispers you can stay.
You're a stranger til she whispers that your journey's over.

Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
Weigh your worth before her majesty, the Verde River.
