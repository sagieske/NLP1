Song:

Hands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would have stayed in bed
How can the day be so long?

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

I missed the first train
Stood out in the rain all day, little did I know
When I caught the next train there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubt, so believe

That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong I wouldn't change a thing

I'd do it, I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again

I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through lead me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong would turn out so lovely
