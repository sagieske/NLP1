Song:

In the marmalade forest [forest]
Between the make believe trees
In a cottage cheese cottage
Lives Albi [Albi] Albi [Albi]
Albi the racist dragon

Part 6

And so all the people of the village
Chased Albi the racist dragon into
A very cold very scary cave and it
Was so cold and scary in there that
Albi began to cry dragon tears,
Which as we all know turn into jellybeans!

Anyway just at that moment he felt a
Tiny little hand rest apon his tail. And who should that little hand belong to, but the badly burnt Albanian boy from the day before.

'What are you doing here I thought I killed you yesterday'
Grumbled Albi quite racistly
'No Albi, you didn't kill me with your dragon flames, I
Crawled to safety but you did leave me very badly disfigured, '
Laughed the boy.

'Why are you crying? '
I'm crying because all of the
Villagers chased me here, I
Think it's because I'm so racist. '
'No Albi they chased me here too, when I became all disfigured like this.
They just don't like you and I. Because... Well because we're different to them.

And with that, Albi cried a single tear, which turned into a jellybean all the colours of the rainbow! And Albi wasn't racist, anymore.

So they sat in the cave [cave]
And ate bubble gum pie [yum! ]
Albi the racist â€“ well not anymore - Dragon... !
