Song:

Honey, there's a funny feeling 'round my heart,
And it's bound to drive your mama wild
It must be something they call the Cuban Doll,
It weren't your mama's angel child

I went to see the doctor the other day, he said I's well as well could be
But I said, "Doctor, you don't know really what's worrying me"
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my loving all the time
I want to be somebody's baby doll to ease my mind

He can be ugly, he can be black, so long as he can eagle rock and ball the
Jack
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the time,
I mean to get my lovin' all the time

Lord, I went to the gypsy to get my fortune told,
She said you in hard luck, Bessie, doggone your bad luck soul
I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the time,
I mean to get my lovin' all the time
