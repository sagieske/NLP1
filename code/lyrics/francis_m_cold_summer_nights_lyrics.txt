Song:

I keep on blaming my self
I should have eaten my pride
how can I convince you
its just a matter of time

Many times I've hurt you
with my foolish ways oh girl
now I know I have to pay the price

Is there a way for you to turn around,
turn around and come back baby
ohh baby can't you see

CHORUS:
its been cold summer nights since we drifted apart
cold summer nights since you walked out that door
cold summer nights here on my own
coz I miss you baby, I need you here

RAP:
cold summer nights girl, I really miss you
you rocked my world
I wanna touch you and kiss you
its my fault
I never called you at home
I'm on the phone, wishing you could call
I'm all alone
is there a way for you to turn around and
come back to me
I hope you understand
that I'm your man and together we can
kiss and make up
'coz you know I can't stand

Repeat Chorus
