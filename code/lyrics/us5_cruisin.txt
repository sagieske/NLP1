Song:

Yeah, summer jam
It's called Cruisin'
This one goes out to all the summer lovers

Give it up for my ladies and pour some Baileys
Livin' up to beat
Got a cool situation
We're cruisin' all night

Hey baby, how about some sunshine
Take a walk through the flower fields
I like the way it feels
You really turn me on when we are together
The feeling is oh so right, we're cruisin' all night

Give it up for my ladies and pour some Baileys
Livin' up to beat
Got a cool situation
We're cruisin' all night

Summer love celebration
Across the nation
Livin' up to the beat
It's a cool situation
We're cruisin' all night

Hey baby, can I get your number
Baby we'll go out tonight
Spend a little time
You're lighten up my world
In any kind of weather
The feeling is oh so right, we're cruisin' all night
Cruisin', cruisin' all night long

Give it up for my ladies and pour some Baileys
Livin' up to beat
Got a cool situation
We're cruisin' all night
(Cruisin' all night long)

Summer love celebration
Across the nation
Livin' up to the beat
It's a cool situation
We're cruisin' all night
(Cruisin' all night long)

Relax your mind, let's take our time
And make this a night to remember, girl
This is your night, let's make it right
Let's make it right, let's make it right

Now what we gonna do right here
Is break it down just a little
So why don't ya all clap your hands a bit
Come on, help me out

Hey ladies, are you down tonight
Yo fellas, are we down tonight
Everybody are you down tonight
