Song:

Everytime I think of you
You always make me smile
Whenever I feel down
You know how to cheer me up

And everytime I feel confused
And I don't know which way to choose
One things for sure
I can always count on you

When I am near
Or when I'm far
Or when I'm completely lost...

In my heart I have no fear
Cos you're my guiding star, oh!

[Chorus:]:
Mamma
You know that I love you
No matter what I
Say or do
I can never thank you, oh
Mamma
You know that I love you
You are the proof
Of what love can do
Truly you are Gods miracle

You're my shelter from the rain,
You're the shoulder I cry on
Whenever I feel pain
One touch from you and the pain is gone!

And all I've ever dreamed to be
Is to make you proud of me
Cos never once
Did you turn your back on me

Your healing words,
Your tender touch
The warmth of your embrace...

The beauty of your soul
Shines through your loving face!

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]:
Your name
Was there first word I've ever spoken
You held my hand
Through the first steps I've taken, oh...
When I wasn't well
You watched me through the night
That is why
Paradise is under
Your feet

[Chorus:] [x3]
