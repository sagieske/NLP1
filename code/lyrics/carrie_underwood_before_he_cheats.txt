Song:

Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleach blonde tramp,
And she's probably getting frisky...
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she can't shoot whiskey...

Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick, showing her how to shoot a combo...

And he don't know...

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little cooped up 4 wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seats...
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,
Slashed a hole in all 4 tires...

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.

Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karoke...
Right now, she's probably saying "I'm drunk"
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky,
Right now, he's probably dabbing on 3 dollars worth of that bathroom cologne...
And he don't know...

That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little cooped up 4 wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seats,
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,
Slashed a hole in all 4 tires...

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.

I might saved a little trouble for the next girl,
Cause the next time that he cheats...

Oh, you know it won't be on me!

Ohh... Not on me...
Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little cooped up 4 wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seats...
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights,
Slashed a hole in all 4 tires...

Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.

Ohh... Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats...

Ohh... Before he cheats...
