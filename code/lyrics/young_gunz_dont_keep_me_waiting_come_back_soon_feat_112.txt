Song:

(Chris):
Fellas grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies grab a hand
Step in 2's
C. West, Gunnaz

(112):
Know 112 is rockin this

(Chris):
Everybody groovin
They catch n' feel us
Enter the buildin
See everybody choosin
I'm looking for somebody
With a body that move it
Think for them women
But my hobby is my music
Still I'm the coolest
Wrist-wear stupid
Glue it, You know you had it good
When you lose it
Don't miss your train, gotta brain
Betta use it
But don't abuse it
Only if you knew it
You could stay up in news
Take you out the buck
N let you coupe it
Late fight
We f**k until some cupid
No whinin and dinin
I hit it from behind and
S. Carter the diamond
I gotta part time it
Baby father home wit the kids
Couldn't time it
She laid back blusha
Rushin for me to climb in
And this about the only time we get
So right after I hit
Before Ch-ris split

Chorus
(112):
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too

(Neef):
It was a college drop out
'Til a year out in Cali
House of blues
Right out the blue
Already had it in my mind
I'm rollin out wit you
I'm tellin C
She the one
I'm pickin out the crew
Yeah, nice lil' breezy
We busted up balcony
Watchin Kanyeezy
They gotta n***a wheezy
Yeah, tell the bartender
Bring another round
It's cool
We can go through our act
We outta town
I'm kinda feelin
That she feelin it too
I'm tryna hit it
Tryna figure
What she willin to do
Yeah, I mow back a W
Room 112
I love the way she smell
She say it Varcenel
We kiss get a tell
Spark up the L
That cranberry juice
Wit that good armedel
And we can get into some lil activities
And if it's good
You can come back and visit me

Chorus
(112):
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too

(Chris):
Fellas grab your shoes
Cars and cruise
Ladies grab a hand
Step in 2's

(Neef):
Ladies grab your L's
Call up all of your girls
Fellas grab your wills
C and Neef, 112
Come on

(Chris and Neef):
N: Now this goes out
To all the girls
Around the world
C: Massages, Menages
N: Them back stage twirls
C: Them bosses
Them flosses
N: Them Diamonds
And the pearls
C: Them sweats
And the track nights
N: Them pros
And them hills
C: You gotta use
What you got girl
To get what you want
N: Instead of givin up that a**
Daddy smokin the blunt
C: Come on and Roll
Wit a playa
N: Get away
From them chumps
C: You do both
We hit more than once
N: And don't front

Chorus
(112):
I said don't keep me waiting to long
Come back soon
You need love
I need love too
