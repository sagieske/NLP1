Song:

For all you broken hearted lovers lost
Go find another one
Cause you know time will break and you'll be late
White rabbits on the run

It's hard to know what's good for you
You know she'll let you down
But the fever breaks when it's too much to take
So you can put your weapons down

And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend

It's never too late to change the pace
When days creep up on you
But the goodness is something you don't have to chase
Cause it's following you

And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again

It's a carousel, my friend

Ooh, Oooh, Oooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, ooh, oooh

Thought I heard your voice in the thunder
Casting long lasting spells never unearthed
Thought I heard your voice in the thunder
Dancing down, dancing spells never unearthed, unearthed

Oooh

And all you'll hear is the music
And beauty stands before me
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, my friend

Until the music
And beauty stands before you
And love comes back around again
It's a carousel, a carousel
It's a carousel, my friend

And time won't wait, so don't be late
White rabbits on the run
