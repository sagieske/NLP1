Song:

He called us slobbering!

Said we were mangy!

Did I hear stupid?

Huh?

Tell us again-- gee
It's so incredible

That you're so rude

When you're so edible

When you are food!

It's time to chow down

Chow down!
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chow down

I'm chompin' at the bit, baby

My stomach's on the growl, son

Chow down!
Chow down!
You both been invited on a date
Two courses handed to us on a plate
We'll have you raw, won't be long to wait
Seeing you're already brown
Chow down!
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chow down!

Your ribs are looking so tasty

Such chewy little chops, chums

Eat up!

Now wasn't it her mom who ate your dad?

And having parents eaten makes us mad

We're gonna settle up the score a tad

We've never had a snack of such renown
Chow down!
Chow down!

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-

What, Ed? What is it?

Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

No

Well, there it goes!

I think we should begin the meal from scratch
So many juicy segments to detach
Be good as gold for you're as good as carved

Here, kitty kitty...

We're starved!
