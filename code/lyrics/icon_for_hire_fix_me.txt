Song:

Another day, another waste of my heart
It only beats when it wants to
Another step, and I've learned to hold my breath
Still scared to want you

I'll be the mess, you be the medicine
I'll be the mess, you play the medicine

Why don't you fix me?
I can't help myself
Why don't you fix me?
You know I'm fading still

I have tried to be better inside
We both know how it kills
I've tried to heal myself so many times,
But we both know that I'm still ill

I'll be the mess, you be the medicine
I'll be the mess, you play the medicine

Why don't you fix me?
I can't help myself
Why don't you fix me?
You know I'm fading still
[x2]

And you know how I try, fight to survive
My hands are bloody from holding myself too tight
You know how it hurts
You know what the pain will be worth

Every scar one day will heal
Every tear one day will dry
[x4]

Why don't you fix me?
I can't help myself
Why don't you fix me?
You know I'm fading still

Why don't you fix me?
Don't you leave me here
Why don't you fix me?
I'm fading faster and faster

Why don't you fix me?
Why don't you fix me?
