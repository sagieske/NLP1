Song:

It is the evening of the day

I sit and watch the children play



I sit and watch as tears go by
Smiling faces I can see but not for me



My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing

Of rain falling on the ground
But all I hear is the sound


I sit and watch as tears go by




It is the evening of the day

I sit and watch the children play

Doing things I used to do
Oh but where are you

I sit and watch as tears go by
