Song:

I don't care what anyone says
'Cause you and I are bigger than this
And I'll be there just keeping my arms wind open
They can try to pull us apart
I'll fight them more, I'll cover your heart
Yeah, we can fly together, we can't be broke

Yeah, we can find love, just like that
We can fall hard, just like that
Yeah, we could do it all, just like that

And I like it when you call me, I will always find you
When you need me out, I'll come for you
And when you're lonely, I will find a way to
Guide you home to me, I'll come for you, come for you
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me

Ooh, now I'm found, I'll never be lost
I'll stick with you no matter the cost
Whatever comes we'll figure it out, I know that
Ooh, you and I like Adam and Ever
You lit the fire growing in me
To changed my life, now there is no way to go back

Yeah, we can find love, just like that
We can fall hard, just like that
Yeah, we could do it all, just like that

And I like it when you call me, I will always find you
When you need me out, I'll come for you
And when you're lonely, I will find a way to
Guide you home to me, I'll come for you, come for you
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me

(Bind your love to me, me
Bind your love to me)
Ooh, now I'm found, I'll never be lost
I'll stick with you no matter the cost
Whatever comes we'll figure it out, I know that

When you call me, I will always find you
When you need me out, I'll come for you
And when you're lonely, I will find a way to
Guide you home to me, I'll come for you

When you call me, I will always find you
When you need me out, I'll come for you
And when you're lonely, I will find a way to
Guide you home to me, I'll come for you, come for you
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
I will bind your love, bind your love to me, me
