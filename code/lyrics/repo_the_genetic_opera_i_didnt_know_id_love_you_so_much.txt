Song:

Shilo:
Dad be still,
There is nothing you need say,
It can wait.

Nathan:
Shi, your mother's calling me.

Shilo:
Sometimes I wanted to cry
When the people on tv were not quite the way we were
Somehow I guess I just knew.
But I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
But I do.

Nathan:
Sometimes I'd stay up all night
Wishing to God that I was the one who died.
Sometimes it's not enough time.
But I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
I didn't know I'd love you so much
But I do.

Shilo:
Didn't know I'd love you so much.

Nathan:
Didn't know I'd love you so much.

Both:
I didn't know I'd love you so much
But I do.

Nathan:
Shilo, go.

Shilo:
Dad, I will not leave you here
You will live.

Nathan:
But you've already saved me, dear.
Go and change the world for me.

Both:
We will always have each other
In our time of need
(Shilo) Daddy, you're the world to me.
(Nathan) Shilo, you're the world to me.
