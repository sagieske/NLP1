Song:

Know you can't hear me
But that does not mean
I don't want you to feel me, ooh ooh
It's just a matter of time
Til you are mine

Who am I? Who am I?
You say angels from the sky don't walk the earth, ooh
As time goes by, I realize
There's so much more than I could ever learn
You're an angel in disguise

Don't cry I'll be home soon
You know I want someone to be with you
It's just a matter of time
Til you are mine

Who am I? Who am I?
You say angels from the sky don't walk the earth, ooh
As time goes by, I realize
There's so much more than I could ever learn
You're an angel in disguise

And the truth is
I am scared all the time
I'm terrified
When I think of the world without her

Who am I? Who am I?
You say angels from the sky don't walk the earth, ooh
As time goes by, I realize
There's so much more than I could ever learn
You're an angel in disguise
