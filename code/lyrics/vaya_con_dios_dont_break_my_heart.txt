Song:

Sometimes I feel so empty
So deserted and so lonely
And no one can take that pain away

Don't break my heart

The anger and the fury
And the fears living inside me
Should you love me
Would you love them just the same

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
I've been strong and brave
Sometimes I lost my faith
And too many times
Threw caution to the wind

So if you tried to understand me
Would you crucify or damn me
Or stand by me
Like smoke around the flame

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
I've been strong and brave
Sometimes lost my faith
And so many times
Saw love come to an end

It's not a question of pride
It's not the tears that I've cried
It's not a question of pride

Don't break my heart
Don't break my heart
I've been strong and brave
Sometimes lost my faith
And so many times
Saw love come to an end

It's not a question of pride
It's not the tears that I've cried
It's not a question of pride
