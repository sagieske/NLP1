Song:

Shades of wine, love keeps dancing through my mind
No I can't escape this time all because of you
Yesterday, love was just a word to say
Overnight a holiday, all because of you

So unreal, life was just a ferris wheel
Till you told me how to feel things I never knew, darlin'

Summer rain, echoing a sweet refrain
Love is such a tender pain, all because of you
So unreal, life was just a ferris wheel
Till you told me how to feel things I never knew, darlin'
Summer rain, echoing a sweet refrain
Love is such a tender pain, all because of you
All because of you, all because of you.
