Song:

Cajun moon, where does your power lie
As you move across the southern sky
You took my babe way too soon
What have you done, Cajun moon
Someday babe, when you want your man
And you find him gone, just like the wind
Don't trouble your mind whatever you do
'Cause Cajun moon took him from you
When daylight fades, the night comes on
You can hear the silence of this song
Don't trouble your mind whatever you do
'Cause he got me like he got you
