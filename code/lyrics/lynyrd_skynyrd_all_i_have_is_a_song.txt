Song:

(gary rossington - johnny vanzant)

These ol' white lines on the highway
Lord it's all I know
Seems like I've been out all my life
But I just can't let it go
Oh you know I ain't complainin'
Cause I can tell, lord it's just your plan
So I thank you for what I have
And that's a song
All I have is a song

I keep thinkin' about the friends I've had
And all the meories we've shared
They keep comin' back, time and time again
Sometimes I wonder was it worth the cost
And all I've lost
Oh you know I ain't complainin'
Cause I can tell, lord it's just your plan
So I thank you for what I have
And that's a song
All I have is a song

So I play this song one more time, 'cause lord it's all I know
I'll be standin' at your door following along
'cause all I have is a song
And this song will live on

All I have is a song
A piece of me to live on
