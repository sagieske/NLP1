Song:

She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of obscenity
Her name was Pauline she lived in a tree
She was the one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace!

Mummy
I'm not an animal!

Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby screaming!

Mummy
Screamin f*****g bloody mess
It's not an animal
It's an abortion

Body I'm not an animal
Mummy I'm not an abortion!

Throbbing squirm gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge
I'm not a loss in protein
I'm not a throbbing squirm

F**k this and f**k that
F**k it all and f**k
The f*****g brat
She don't wanna baby that looks like that
I don't wanna baby that looks like that
Mummy
I'm not an animal
Mummy
I'm not an abortion

I'm not an animal Mummy!
