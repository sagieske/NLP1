Song:

Me and you
Singing
On the train
Me and you
Listening
To the rain
Me and you
We are the same
Me and you
Have all the fame
We need, indeed
You and me are we

Me and you
Singing
In the park
Me and you
Light candles
In the dark
Me and you
We are the spark
We'll watch
That light
Just make an arc
To say someday
There will be
A better way

Me and you
Were waiting
For the dawn
Me and you
And all the places
We've gone
Me and you
Sitting on the lawn
Me and you
Just singing a song
A rhyme to shine
And to pass the time

Me and you
Singing to all
Me and you
Were not so small
Me and you
Can stand up tall
Me and you
Just having a ball
Happy to be
You and me
