Song:

What's it like beyond the distant blue sky?
No one has an answer, I want to feel it
It's okay because I'm not afraid of starting something
If I step on it, I'll even reach galaxies

Adventure rider, yes, it's the future!
Our bare paths
Connect until the heavens
Adventure rider, I'm wandering
Let's fly over rainbows
To the sun, let's fly with the sky rider

Who on earth decided that you can't fly at all?
The image of infinite possibilities expands
And your excited heart becomes wings
Brush away the idea of being like that Icarus myth

Adventure rider, yes, we've arrived!
Don't call it a miracle
We'll make your dreams come true one by one
Adventure rider, don't cry
Bask in the expanding world
We'll always push on forward

In times of worry, close your eyes
The notes of the wind will seem to fill your ears softly

Adventure rider, yes, it's the future!
Our bare paths
Connect until the heavens
Adventure rider, yes, we've arrived!
Don't call it a miracle
We'll make your dreams come true one by one
Adventure rider, I'm wandering
Let's fly over rainbows
To the sun, let's fly with the sky rider
