Song:

Ever since you left
Everything has changed
We'll never be the same again
This place has seemed so strange
I needed to get out of here
There's sadness in this town
But every time I moved away
It's followed me around
And I don't need a song to sing
I don't need anything at all
I don't even need to dance
I can just stand with my back against the wall
So I can see the way you feel
So I can know the thoughts that run through your mind
I wasn't giving up on you
You used to seem impossible to deny
Tell me there's a reason why I'm here
I need to believe it
Here I go again
Burning up the night
Even though I couldn't resist
I told myself I could
And hoped to God I always felt like this
She can't decide if I'm a king or trash
She loves me for the Johnny
But she hates me for the Cash
And you can only take so much
If you could see the way I feel
If you could know the thoughts that run through my mind
I wasn't giving up on you
It used to seem impossible to deny
Tell me there's a reason why I'm here
I need to believe it
Here I go again
Burning up the night
You can't escape the morning
When there's someone on your mind
I been doing this for years now
And can't break any ground
And I don't know what to do but keep on moving on
Wouldn't I be your shoulder?
Wouldn't I have broken your fall?
Does it still hurt?
Now that you're older have you healed at all?
Here I go again
Burning up the night
You can't escape the morning
When there's someone on your mind
A man can feel like he's in hell
When he doesn't want to be
In a place where what's inside of him
Is all that's left to see
