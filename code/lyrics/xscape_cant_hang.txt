Song:

[Intro by JD:]
Let's get down
Let's get down

[Verse One (Kandi):]
You claim you've been waiting,
With no game, just anticipating,
How it would be if you and I were in the sack
But to me you look like you wouldn't know how to act

[Bridge (LaTocha):]
I need someone to hold me,
All night long.
It must be you my darling,
Am I wrong.
It ain't a damn thing baby,
Show me what you can bring,
Cause some try to swang but they still can't hang.

[Chorus:]
You and me let's get down,
Even though you claim that you've been around,
I betcha can't hang,
I betcha can't hang.
[Repeat x2]

[Verse Two (Kandi):]
You claim you can do this, this and that,
Ain't no shame in my game,
If it's wack I gotta tell you that.
So you betta be up on your down stroke,
You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat,
Cause in my mind I think your gonna slip baby.

[Repeat Break and Chorus]

[Rap by MC Lyte:]
You talk a lot of this and you talk a lot of that,
Is it all fact brotha man are you phat?
Cause if it's on the real I come with mad sex appeal,
Flip light delicious, you know the deal.
Hey that's me, I be the slick,
The one with the physique,
I freak you in the sheets.
I take a nigga deep down under,
I make him wonder,
How to make the lighting come before the thunder.
That's the pleasure I bring,
I make a nigga get up and sing,
Tinga linga ling ling.
I got the pow, da boogie and the bang bang
You can't hang don't talk da game

[Repeat Chorus]
