Song:

1-2-3-4
Between a man and a woman
Life begins again
Between love and confusion
Here Lies only pain
Take my world,
Heal my soul,
Shake my pride,
Do not let go
Give me the sun
And the moon above
If the stars should fall
Only heaven knows

Between a man and a woman
It's everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all

In a rhyme or a reason
Will make us think the same
You tell me I'm half crazy
But you're insane

Take my world,
Heal my soul,
Shake my pride,
Do not let go
Give me the sun
And the moon above
If the stars should fall
Only heaven knows

Between a man and a woman
It's everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all

She says love me like you did you did before
He says love me like you did you did once more

Between a man and a woman
It's everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all

Take my world,
Heal my soul,
Shake my pride,
Do not let go
Give me the sun
And the moon above
If the stars should fall
Only heaven knows

Take my world,
Heal my soul,
Shake my pride,
Do not let go
Give me the sun
And the moon above
If the stars should fall
Then only heaven knows

Between a man and a woman
It's everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all

Everything or nothing at all.

Everything or nothing at all.
