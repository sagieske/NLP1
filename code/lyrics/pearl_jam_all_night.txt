Song:

Got all night
Plenty of time
Take these chains
From my eyes
So alive
Gettin 'it prime
Take 'em there
Before you die
Why be satisfied
We've got all night
Please be here
Top of the stairs
No place for
The president
Build some fears
Left outside
f**k, be content
To just get by
Why be satisfied
We've got all night
You scream and wail
You see who cares
Scream and wail
See who cares
Life has nothin' to do with
Killin' time
So why be satisfied
We've got... All night
We've got all night
We've got all night
