Song:

We're getting ready for the Friday night fights
And we're not even watching T. V.
I wonder why I work so hard hurting you
And you seem to love leaving me

I can't live with you and I can't live without you
I can't seem to keep it in gear
But it feels so bad when you leave me alone
It's almost like having you here

How does a whole week of Heaven become
Hell on a Saturday night
We can't be contented just getting along
Does the makin' up make it alright

I can't live with you and I can't live without you
I can't seem to keep it in gear
But it feels so bad when you leave me alone
It's almost like having you here

I can't live with you and I can't live without you
I can't seem to keep it in gear
But it feels so bad when you leave me alone
It's almost like having you here
