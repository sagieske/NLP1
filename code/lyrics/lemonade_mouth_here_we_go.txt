Song:

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now

Hey, now
We no longer wait a-round
My team stronger
Like weights now
Keeps on growin'
Our muscle keeps
On showin'

We came here to make a change
We came here to rearrange
We came here 'cause we believe
We came here 'cause we acheive

While I got the microphone
Make sure how I feel is known
All for one we rock the zone
How I feel to each his own

All my people treat 'em right
We reserve the right to fight
For what we want
And what we need
To the front
We shall proceed

Here we come
And we're ready to go go go
You'd better run
'Cause we don't take no no no
So c'mon

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now

We're motivated
We're aggravated
We're dedicated
So, now you're barricaded

Determination
Willpower
No consideration
We will devour
We're on our own
But we are one
Shoulder to shoulder
We'll fight until we see the sun

It's just a matter of time
Before you see our way
We fightin' for our lives
We'll do this every day

Here we come
And we're ready
To go go go
Youi'd better run
'Cause we don't take
No no no
So, c'mon

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now

Be heard, be strong, be proud
I wanna make some noise
Stand up, c'mon, be loud
We gonna raise our voice

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
You gotta hear me now
