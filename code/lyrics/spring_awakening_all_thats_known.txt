Song:

Boys chanting and repeating:
... Litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
Vi superum, saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram,
Multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem...
Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit...

Melchior:
All that's known,
In History, in Science,
Overthrown
At school, at home, by blind men.

You doubt them,
And soon they bark and hound you-
Till everything you say is just another bad about you.

All they say
Is "Trust in What Is Writen."
Wars are made
And somehow that is wisdom.

Thought is suspect,
And money is their idol,
And nothing is okay unless it's scripted in their Bible.

But I know
There's so much more to find-
Just in looking through myself, and not at them.

Still, I know
To trust my own true mind,
And to say: there's a way through this...

On I go,
To wonder and to learning-
Name the stars and know their dark returning.

I'm calling,
To know the world's true yearning-
The hunger that a child feels for everything they're shown.

You watch me-
Just watch me-
I'm calling,
And one day all will know.

You watch me-
Just watch me-
I'm calling, I'm calling
And one day all will know.
