Song:

All I do is dream of you
The whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin' of you

You're every thought, you're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, (scat) and spring

And were there more than twenty-four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away

Sky's are gray, sky's are blue
Morning, noon and nighttime, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you
