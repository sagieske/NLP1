[Fred:] What's up with this f*****g 'Ball Tongue' s**t? (on original lyric's sheet)

[Fred:] You better shut the f**k up, punk. (on orignal lyric's sheet)
[Jon:] Whatever n***a... (on orignal lyric's sheet)
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My d**k is bigger than yours
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
I say what, say what?
My band is bigger than yours

Too bad I got your beans in my bag
You stuck-up sucka', corny motherfucka'
Takin' over flows is the Limp Pimp (Pick)
Need a Bizkit to save this crew from Jon Davis
I'm gonna drop a little east side skill
Ya best step back 'cuz I'm 'a kill, I'm 'a kill
So whatcha thinking Mr. Raggedy man?
Doin' all you can to look like Raggedy Ann

I'll check you out punk
Yes I know you feel it
You look like one of those dancers from the Hanson video
You little faggot hoe (Say what, say what?)
Please give me some s**t to work with 'cuz right now I'm all it kid
Suck my d**k kid, like your daddy did

Who the f**k you think you're talking to? (Me)
I'm known for eatin' little whiny chumps like you (Whatever)
All up in my face with that (Are you ready?)
But halitosis is all you're rockin' steady
You little fairy
Smelling all your flowers
Nappy hairy chest
Look, it's Austin Powers (Oh yeah, baby)
I hear ya tweetin' on them fag-pipes clod
But you said it best, "There's no place to hide"

What the f**k ya' sayin'?
You're a pimp whateva'
Limp d**k
Fred Durst needs to rehearse
Needs to reverse what he's saying (Say what, say what?)
Wannabe funk
Joke is what you're playin'
Rippin' up a bad counterfeit, fakin'
Plus your bills I'm paying
You can't eat that s**t every day, Fred
Lay off the bacon (Say what, say what)
(You better watch your fu***n' mouth, Jon)

So you hate me and I hate you
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family
I hate you and you hate me
You know what?
It's all in the family

Look at you fool
I'm gonna f**k you up twice (oh you woos)
Throwin' rhymes at me like
Oh s**t alright, Vanilla Ice
Ya better run, run while ya can (Say what?)
Can never f**k me up Bisc Limpkit (Say what?)
At least I got a phat original band

Who's hot, who's not? (You)
You best step back
Korn on the cob
You need a new job
Time to take them mic skills back to the dentist and buy yourself a new grill (f**k you)
You pumpkin pie, I'll jack-off in your eye
Climbing shoots and ladders while your ego shatters
But you just can't get away (Get a g**?)
'Cuz it's doomsday kid, it's doomsday

So I hate you and you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (Oh yeah, oh yeah, you got it)
I hate you and you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family

You call yourself a singer? (Yep)
You're more like Jerry Springer (Oh cool)
Your favourite band is Winger (Winger?)
And all you eat is Zingers
You're like a Fruity Pebble
Your favorite flag is rebel (Yeeeeeehaaaaaa!!)
It's just too bad that you're a fag and on a lower level

So you're from Jacksonville
Kickin' it like Buffalo Bill
Gettin' butt-f****d by your uncle Chuck
While your sister's on her knees waitin' for your fu***n' nut

Wait, where'd ya get that little dance? (Over here)
Like them idiots in Waco
You're burning up in Bako where your father had your mother
Your mother had your brother
It's just too bad your father's mad
Your mother's now your lover

Come on hillbilly
Can your horse do a fu***n' wheelie?
You love it down south
And boy, you sure do got a purdy mouth

I hate you and you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (Yeah, you got it, you got it)
And I hate you and you hate me
You know what, you know what?
It's all in the family (You got it, you got it)
And I love you
And I want you
And I'll suck you
And I'll f**k you
And I'll butt-f**k you
And I'll eat you
And I'll lick your little d**k, motherfucka'
Say what? Say, what?
What? Say what?
