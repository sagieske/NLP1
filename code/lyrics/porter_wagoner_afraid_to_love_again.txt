Song:

If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
