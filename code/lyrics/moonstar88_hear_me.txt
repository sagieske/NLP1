Song:

Wait... You have to hear my voice
And I hate to sing this song of fate
Afraid, I feel the end of days
I'm a sale from my drowning brain
You have to hear me now
Insane, stop eating your fame
I'm drained with the game you play
It's the same life you live in vain
I can't change
Despite the hundred times I pray
You have to hear me now
