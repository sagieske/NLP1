Song:

[Verse 1:]
By faith
I can get to many places
Maybe even see many faces
I mean things that are unexpected
Because of my faith I may
Have to deal with a little bit of hate
And it may seem like there's no way
That's why I gotta have my faith

[Chorus: x2]
(Faith)
I gotta have
(Faith)
Can't make it without it
(Faith)
Where I wanna be I gotta have (ohh yeah)
(Faith)

[Verse 2:]
Now without faith
Things are impossible
Like me wanting to please him
I gotta forget about them
Those that don't like me where I am
Cause then I am in jam
Tryna make a decision
Should I listen or should I go
I don't know (Faith)
That's why I gotta have(faith)
I gotta have faith (whooaahh yeaah)

[Chorus:]
(Faith)
I gotta have
(Faith)
Can't make it without it(whooaaahh)
(Faith)

[Bridge:]
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for
The evidence of things not seen
And this explains it all
Where I am now
I may not be pleased
So I'll have to seek him diligently
And my Word says
He will reward me(Can't make it without it)
So why not have

[Chorus:]
(Faith)
I gotta have faith (yeeaaaah)
(Faith)
When my family is sick (faith) and they can't get well
(Faith)
I gotta have faith (yeeeaaaahh)
(Faith)
I gotta have faith
(Faith)
No matter what they give me or bring to my way
I gotta have faith (yeeeeeaaah)
(Faith)
I gotta have faith
(Faith)
It's the only thing that will pull me through
(Yeeeeeaaahh)
