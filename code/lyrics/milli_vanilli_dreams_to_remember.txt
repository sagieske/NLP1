Song:

So long babe. I'm running out of time.
I'll never forget ya. You bless this heart of mine.
Homeward bound and you lay sound asleep.
Lost and found, these mem-'ries I keep.
I've got dreams to remember.
They're all about a love in September.
Dreams to remember.
Burning like the glow of an ember.
They're all about you.
Yesterday calls like some enchanted star.
I reach up to grab, but it's no easy mark.
Sweet and low, I land back on my feet.
Romeo will have your soul to keep.
I've got dreams to remember.
They're all about a love in September.
Dreams to remember.
Burning like the glow of an ember.
They're all about you.
I've got dreams to remember.
