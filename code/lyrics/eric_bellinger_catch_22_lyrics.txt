Song:

You know I love you girl
I just can't stand you girl
But I don't wanna see you with nobody
Don't wanna see you with nobody
It's a catch 22
It's a catch 22

Don't wanna see you with nobody
But I don't want you, girl
No I don't want you, girl
Catch 22

Prettiest thing I've ever seen
Beauty, it ain't everything it seems
Gave you everything that you needed, yea
Plus I'm high, you still complain to me

Girl, I don't want to but I got to
Let you go
If I see you with another man I might lose control
Just being honest
Cause I'm still a man
And I still got pride
And you're still the one I love

You know I love you girl
(I know you love me boy)
I just can't stand you girl
(Can't stand you either boy)
But I don't wanna see you with nobody (nobody)
Don't wanna see you with nobody
(See me with nobody)
It's a catch 22
(20, 22)
It's a catch 22
(20, 22)

Don't wanna see you with nobody
But I don't want you, girl
No I don't want you, girl
Catch 22

I'm territorial
Cause I done worked so hard to be there for you
To be there through it all
Disappointment is all I got in return
Enough that you will learn
But now we gotta let it burn

You know I love you girl
(I know you love me boy)
I just can't stand you girl
(Can't stand you either boy)
But I don't wanna see you with nobody
(See me nobody)
Don't wanna see you with nobody
(See me with nobody)
It's a catch 22
(20, 22)
It's a catch 22
(What? Catch what? 22)

Don't wanna see you with nobody
But I don't want you, girl
No I don't want you, girl

Hope he put that money in yo pocket better
Hope he take you the mall
I know you gon be trippin every time you miss a call
Cus you be on that bullshit (what?)
That's my work (what?)
I'm just speakin that true s**t (what?)
Wait, let me call my man

Cause you know I love you girl
(I know you love me boy)
I just can't stand you girl
But I don't wanna see you with nobody
Don't wanna see you with nobody else
Catch 22
