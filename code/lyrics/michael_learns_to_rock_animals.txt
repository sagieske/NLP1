Song:

Animals
Wild rivers and waterfalls
I can hear the planet call
Show a little respect

Beautiful
To everything that is beautiful
And if you want to save it all
Show a little respect

In the sun
Another day is born
While all the world is sleeping
There's music in the dawn

See the clouds
Phantoms in the sky
Changing as the wind blows
Right before your eyes

Through these creations
We learn to understand
The wonder of life
We're holding in our hands

Chorus:
Animals
Wild rivers and waterfalls
I can hear the planet call
Show a little respect

There's a place
A green and peaceful place
A place without the borders
To divide human race

It's been created
In a billion years
Don't tear it apart
Don't drive the world to tears

Chorus:
Animals
Wild rivers and waterfalls
I can hear the planet call
Show a little respect

Beautiful
To everything that is beautiful
And if you want to save it all
Show a little respect

In the name of progress
Everybody's gone too far
In the name of money...
Who do we think we are
