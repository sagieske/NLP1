Song:

Ballerina in a music box with your pink shoes on
Satin ribbons in your hair
Dance to something soft and sweet
Ghost of a little girl who fell asleep there right beside me

And you look so beautiful and lost
But don't turn out the light this time
Don't turn out the light on me tonight

This is simple
This is new
That's why I'm not scared of you
But you're afraid in ways that I can't comprehend
I do not pretend to live beneath your soft blonde hair
Inside your head
Wrapped up in darkness
Slow dancing with despair

You look so beautiful and lost
But don't turn out the light this time
Don't turn out the light on me tonight
Don't turn out the light
Don't turn out the light
Don't turn out the light inside

Spinning harder now you seem confused
I close my eyes but I'm still watching you
If you're broken I will gather up your pieces from the filthy ground

But don't turn out the light this time
Don't turn out the light on me tonight
Don't turn out the light

Spinning harder now you seem confused
I close my eyes but I'm still watching you
If you're broken I will gather up your pieces from the filthy ground

But don't turn out the light this time
Don't turn out the light on me tonight
Oh
On me tonight
Don't turn out the light
Don't turn out the light
Don't turn out the light on me tonight
Oh
On me tonight

(Don't turn out the light)
And you look so beautiful and lost
(Don't turn out the light)
(Don't turn out the light)
Oh
You look so beautiful and lost
(Don't turn out the light)

(Don't turn out the light)
Oh
(Don't turn out the light)
(Don't turn out the light)
Oh
(Don't turn out the light)
This time
