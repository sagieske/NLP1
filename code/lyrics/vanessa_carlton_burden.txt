Song:

Always a do or die situation
You can only see in black and white
But you never thought, never thought that I'd be
A little different this time, and
Not every color that you will see
Is the real one every time
Let me clue you in on complexity
And everybody is so very fine
And I didn't mean to be a burden
Just thought I'd share a little light
But I thought you needed to know something
Something that comes from the inside
Something that comes from the inside

And as you wasted time playing detective
Is it to figure out my mystery?
Well let me tell you now that I'm no secret
'Cause I can sin before you righteously
And I didn't mean to be a burden
Just thought I'd share a little light
But I thought you needed to know something
Something that comes from the inside
Something that comes from the inside
Something that comes from the inside

Don't grow bored too quickly
I haven't finished yet
I know it must be painful
To hear what's left unsaid
Don't refuse
It's no use
You can not run from this
Just sit still
And listen
Listen to all you missed
But it's always a do or die situation
You can only see in black and white
But you never thought, never thought that I'd be
A little different this time

And I didn't mean to be a burden
Just thought I'd share a little light
But I thought you needed to know something
Something that comes from the inside
Something that comes from the inside
Something that comes from the inside
