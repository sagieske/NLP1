Song:

Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?

Chorus:
Yeah, don't get me wrong, babe, I don't want you back
But nobody asking me what we have
I know it's truth cause I can guarantee
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me
You I ain't gonna never need another me
You I ain't gonna never need another me, oh!

I was tied around your finger, before you let me go
You say you will... Why you do me so cold?
Loved you forever, you loved me all along
Guess you ain't noticed what you got until was gone!
And when you want...
I know you ever wanted... And the best you ever have
You should have seen the... And missed the only chance
Now you're crying right back like damn!

Chorus:
(Honey, honey) is that the way you feel?
(Baby, baby) is that the way you feel now?
(Love me, love me) is that the way you feel?
Attention damn player, you got a new girl like that
(Honey, honey) so that's the way you feel?
(Baby, baby) yeah I bet you feel good
(Love me, love me) is that the way you feel?
You can keep trying I think you need a new reminding, baby!

Chorus:
Yeah, don't get me wrong, babe, I don't want you back
But nobody asking me what we have
I know it's truth cause I can guarantee
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me

Go on and you need it, no one can compare
S** you little thing, with the cool in my hair
And I would never wanted baby, I was...
Never mentioned you want it all, I will do you like a pro
I ain't trembling, better... Anyway
Karma seems to act around everything you used to say
... And you know it, baby!

Chorus:
Yeah, don't get me wrong, babe, I don't want you back
But nobody asking me what we have
I know it's truth cause I can guarantee
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me
You I ain't gonna never need another me, another me
