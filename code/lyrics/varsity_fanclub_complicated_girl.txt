Young boys
What it is
Let's go

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick

I think you gotta get your hair right, loosen up you're so tight
Baby come on (let me in tonight)
You got me lost inside your circus, you got me feelin' nervous
Baby come on

She says this, she means that
And she's not calling me back
I keep going in circles, around and around
She get's hot, she get's cold
And when she puts us on hold
My whole world is caught up in this complicated girl

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick

Is caught up in this complicated
Girl how you run your operations, I'm loosing all my patience
Baby come on (good God I'm saying)
The time is coming, got a decision
Show me what I'm missing
Baby come on, come on

She says this, she means that
And she's not calling me back
I keep going in circles, around and around
She get's hot, she get's cold
And when she puts us on hold
My whole world is caught up in this complicated girl

Complex, complex I'm not your ex
You're complicated, she's so complicated
Complew, complew I'm not your ex
You're complicated to me, ooh

Let me get you shorty, your body
You can meet me in the lobby
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get, get, get that chick

Let me get you shorty, your body
You can meet me in the lobby
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get, get, get that chick

She says this, she means that
And she's not calling me back
I keep going in circles, around and around
She get's hot, she get's cold
And when she puts us on hold
My whole world is caught up in this complicated girl x2

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick
Caught up in this complicated girl

Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Let me get, get, get that chick
Get that chick, get that chick
Caught up in this complicated girl
