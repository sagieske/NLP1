Song:

So many people
I know only a few
Yes I may say that I love this man
And that man
But what keeps me from loving you?
Date of birth geography
The color of my skin ideology
You got ten fingers two legs one nose
Like me
Just like me
And it's as simple as that
You see
And if I don't know who to love
I love them all
And if I don't know who to trust
I trust them all
And if I don't know who to kill
I may kill myself instead
From the mouth of a baby
Will come the world-saving words
That will save us all
And from the lungs of a child
Will come the everlasting breath of god
Increasing peace and honesty
And not carrying on despite of me
Don't you know
This ain't about no race, no creed
No race, no creed
And it's as simple as that
You see
And if I don't know who to love
I love them all
And if I don't know who to trust
I trust them all
And if I don't know who to kill
No suicide
I'm already dead
