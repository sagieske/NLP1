Song:

Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle,
One not on the list

Send away for a perfect world
One not simply
So absurd

In these times of doing what you're told,
Keep these feelings
No one knows

Whatever happened
To the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain,
As he slowly fell apart...

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
[Forty-five]
Swimming thru the ashes of another life,
[Another life]
No real reason to accept the way
Things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45...

Send a message to the unborn child,
Keep your eyes open for a while.

In a box high up on the shelf,
Left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life,
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight.

Whatever happened
To the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain,
As he slowly fell apart!

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
[Forty-five]
Swimming thru the ashes of another life
[Another life]
No real reason to accept the way things have changed,
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Everyone's pointing their fingers,
Always condemning me!
Nobody knows what I believe,
I believe...

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
[Forty five]
Swimming thru the ashes of another life,
[Another life]
No real reason to accept the way things have changed,
Staring down the barrel of a 45...

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
[Ooooohhh...]
And I'm swimming thru the ashes of another life,
[Ooooohhh...]
There is no real reason to accept the way
Things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45...

45[x2]
Starin down the barrel of a 45...

[Panting]
