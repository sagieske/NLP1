Song:

I am a back door man.
I am a back door man.
Well the men don't know, but the little girls understand.
When everybody's sound asleep,
I'm somewhere making my midnight creep.
Yes in the morning, the rooster crow.
Something tell me, I got to go.
I am a back door man.
I am a back door man.
Well the men don't know, but little girls understand.
They take me to the doctor. Shot full o' holes.
Nurse cried, please save the soul.
Killed him for murder, first degree.
Judge's wife cried. Let the man go free.
I am a back door man.
I am a back door man.
Well the men don't know, but little girls understand.
Stand out there. Cop's wife cried.
Don't take him down. Rather be dead.
Six feets in the ground.
When you come home you can eat pork and beans.
I eats mo' chicken any man seen
I am a back door man.
I am a back door man.
Well the men don't know, but the little girls understand
