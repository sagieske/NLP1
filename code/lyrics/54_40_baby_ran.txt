Song:

Well I won't come back
And I won't say no
But that means the circle around us
Will cut a little lower like you said
One play near
You seem so surprised
Least inside you get that
Pretty little nightmare it comes alive
Chorus:
Baby ran she ran away
Why she ran I got to say
I'm lonesome all the time
Baby she ran she ran away
Why she ran I got to say
I know one reason why
Well each time I see you
So far away
A love letter worry that tells me
I'm all right all right
Here am I
Who chose to ride
Pass me wondering whether I got a job
But it's alright until one day
Chorus
