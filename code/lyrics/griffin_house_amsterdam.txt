Song:

I went to Amsterdam.
I got so lost
Down the way.
I took the crooked path.
I wish that I'd never stayed.
I cannot change the past.
Can I change?
Change the past?

Ticket in hand to leave, 
I sit on the train and think of you.
Your face in the photograph, 
I run my finger down your cheek.
I cannot change the past.
Can I change?
Change the past?

I cannot change the past.
All of it's done in Amsterdam
