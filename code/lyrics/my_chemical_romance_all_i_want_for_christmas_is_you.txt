Song:

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true, baby all I want for christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking, way above the fireplace
Santa Clause won't make me happy with a toy on christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for christmas is you, babe baby.

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (oh I wont even wish for snow)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it, to the North Pole for St. Nick
Won't even stay awake to hear the magic reindeer play

Cause I just want you here tonight
Holdin' on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh baby all I want for christmas is you, oh baby

Oh how the lights are shining surrounding everywhere (surrounding everywhere)
Where the sounds of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singin'
Oh I hear those sleigh bells ringin'
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you bring back my baby to me?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm askin for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Is you, you,
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you

You, you, you, you, you, you, you...
