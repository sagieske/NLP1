Song:

When I asked him,
He described a thousand lifetimes.
At each turn, a hint of what one still must learn.
Now I've read the thoughts of philosophers,
The words of liars, who say that underneath I'm worthless.
Incomplete?
Some one said we live our lives in between the extremes.
Is the art of life discipline?
Is that the sweet mystery?
The art of life is...
Without rushing, without faltering we push it as far as we can.
Observe with patience.
Free your mind.
Efficiency, control.
To develop the form starts with acceptance,
Then submission to the goal.
Some one said somewhere we live our lives in between the extremes.
Is the art of life discipline?
Is that the sweetest mystery?
The art of life is...
Without rushing, without faltering, unraveling the secrets of knowledge.
We must challenge and defeat our four natural enemies;
Fear.
Clarity of mind.
Power and the desire to rest.
