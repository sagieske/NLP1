Song:

[Intro:]
Yea
Yea
Uh

[Hook:]
I be running through the city, city on my back
It ain’t nothing changed but the money on my lap
True I’m in the game, time til it’s over
Til it’s over, til it’s over
I be running through the city, city on my back
It ain’t nothing changed but the money on my lap
True I’m in the game til it’s over
Til it’s over, til it’s over

[Verse:]
I be running through the city, city on my back
Way before the fame and all this love and all these stacks
I was just a little homie, now you see me bossin up
N****s see me in a suit, suit me yea I don’t give a f**k
Got the whole team here, no coach needed ball
All coast season homecourt playin, why you sideline hatin?
When I’m just tryna go get mine, it’s gang time, time I shine
My eyesight straight these lines to the go, ready for the show
Ready for the hoes, who ready to roll?
Gone with the wind, you gonna need a blow
Blow my high, don’t kill the vibe
3rd degree still burning slow
You could never put my lights out, money I can swerve, got more to count
Probably get more than I care to count, I’m far

[Hook:]
I be running through the city, city on my back
It ain’t nothing changed but the money on my lap
True I’m in the game, time til it’s over
Til it’s over, til it’s over
I be running through the city, city on my back
It ain’t nothing changed but the money on my lap
True I’m in the game til it’s over
Til it’s over, til it’s over
