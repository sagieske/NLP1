Song:

Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that out bound bus for Vegas.
And we're all out here talkin trash, makin bets,
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes.
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress.

We all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in we'll just sail away.
But we're just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
We're just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
Out here goin broke.
Hey-yea
Yea we're just blowin...
Smoke.

Well Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the Pen
With 2 to 5 or 5 to 10
Or longer, yea
And Brenda's tradin smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's bout to graduate
From college...

I just flick an ash into the tray
And tell em both it'll be okay
But I'm just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
I'm just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
I'm out here goin broke.
Hey-yea
Yea we're just blowin...
Smoke.

We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake.
Yea, We all say that we'll quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

Wipe down the bar,
Take out the trash,
Light one up,
And count my cash.
Swear I'm never comin back again.

I'm just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
I'm just blowin smoke.
Hey-yea
Out here goin broke.
Hey-yea
Yea we're just blowin...
Smoke.
