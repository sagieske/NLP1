Song:

Substitute my gloom with happiness
Substitute my sickness with health
Substitute my enemies with real good friends
Morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes
Morphine & chocolate can bring me up
Can warm my heart whenever I want it
And every once in a while when I stop and think
Morphine & chocolate are my substitute, substitutes
And you can say "hey, we've really come a long way"
And you can say "say, it can only be this way"
But, you might be careful, it really, it really come a long way
And you can say "hey, it can only be this way"
But, you might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You might be careful, it really hurts when it's real
You'll go down, down, down, ooh
Set the alarm clock, baby,
Don't you miss the sun?
I'm feeling really warm hearted baby
Don't you know I'm feeling like someone
I'm fearing for my heart
Morphine & chocolate could never substitute my art!
And that's real love baby
And that's real love baby
And that's real love baby
