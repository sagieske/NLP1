Song:

Exorcise the demon
That is living up inside you
After all you think you've been trough
Just what have you been through?

Try to get beside yourself
It's tearing at your insides
If you end up on the wrong side
Always, standing so strong

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you'll know
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go, of letting go
You're full of s**t, you're born to quit

Something supernatural
It seems it could possess you
No, my level, it's about you
And that might not be true (that might not be true)

How they cared to demonize
The f****d up situation
How you killed off all the angels
Taking notice of you

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you'll know
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go, of letting go
You're full of s**t, you're born to quit

You've blown it
You're born to quit

Sharpen up your teeth
Your dreams are more than worth defending
In a fight that's never ending
Go on, go ahead and prove me wrong

The further you go, the less you'll know
You're born to quit, you've blown it (you've blown it)
You need to let go, of letting go
You're full of s**t, you're born to quit

You've blown it
You're born to quit
You've blown it
(You've blown it, You've blown it)
