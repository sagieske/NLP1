Song:

Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain so don't be blue
'Cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be, yeah

So baby straighten up, come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe, yeah

And say now baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby here's why
Love is here standing by
Love is here standing by

You trusted him and gave him your love
A love he proved unworthy of

Too bad it was him that you trusted
Too bad but you can't be disgusted
It's time that you got readjusted
And realized that tear filled eyes
Can't never stop him now, no no no

That man is on his way I think he's gone to stay
You better drop him now, yeah

Now, baby, baby don't cry, no no
Baby, baby here's why
Because love is here standing by
Say, “Love is here standing by”

All you've got to do
Is dry your eyes long enough to see
That you have found the love you thought
You had in him here in me

Love is hope girl, love is strength
Here's someone standing right beside you
Who would go to any length
To give you love, true and deep

And hope you realize at last
You found a love that you can keep
And only losers weep

So baby, baby don't you cry now
Oh baby, let me tell you one last time
Don't you know that love is here standing by your side
Love is here standing by your tears aren't shed in vain I said so

Baby, baby don't cry
Baby, baby don't cry
