Song:

Everything that I do just doesn't seem
Quite good enough for you
No matter how hard I try you still complain
You're never satisfied

And I don't know how I can put up with you
Do you realize that you criticize every single thing that I do

Chorus:
Well I'm just trying to do the best that I can
So why are you always bringing me down?
I make the best of every circumstance
So why are you always bringing me down?
Does it make you feel better?

Anytime that I want to do anything
You tell me it's not right
And it seems like every time, you talk to me
You're trying to start a fight

And I don't know how much more I can take of you
When you put down, and you turn around
Every single thing that I do

Chorus

Solo

Bridge:
You're so condescending, it's making me mad
You go out of your way just to make me look bad

And I don't know how I can put up with you
Do you realize that you criticize every single thing that I do
And I'm getting tired of your attitude

Chorus
