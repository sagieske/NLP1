Song:

Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun

Burn it up
Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together, yeah
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun, burn it up

The world is out, it's all over town
Your work is done, time for some fun
Let's get it on, the feeling is right
Come on, baby, let's do it tonight, I say

Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun

Let's have some fun, baby
Let's have big fun tonight
Big fun tonight, let's have big fun

Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
We're gonna, we're gonna do it together
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun
Big fun, burn it up, burn it up
[Incomprehensible]

Burn it up
Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
We can do it together, yeah
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun
Big fun, burn it up, burn it up

Burn it up, let's burn it up, fun
Burn up the night, big fun
Burn it up, let's burn it up, fun
Burn up the night, big fun

Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun
Have some fun, have some fun

Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
We're gonna do it together
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun
Big fun, burn it up, burn it up

Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
We're gonna, we're gonna do it together
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun
Big fun, burn it up, burn it up

Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
And we can do it together, baby
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun, big fun
Burn it up, burn it up

Let's burn up the night, baby, let's do it together
Let's burn up the night, let's have big fun
