Song:

There ain't no melody
And I can't find a harmony
If there were a way to say it
You know I would have played it

Well, I'm a man of few words
Trying to find a rhyme
And finally it occurred to me
That I'm wasting my time
There ain't no rhyme or reason
Ain't no time or season
Ain't no way around it
I know I would have found it

There ain't no song in the whole wide world
Could hardly sing without you
There ain't no song in the whole wide world
To tell you the way that I feel

Painters use their eyes
To show us what they see
But when that canvas dries
We all see it differently

There ain't black or white
There ain't no day or night
There ain't no way around it
You know I would have found it

Chorus

No, no, no, I might as well pack it on up
Not even this song's gonna tell you the way that I feel
