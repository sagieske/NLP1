When times was hard an rough
You neva left you always had my back
You held my cash when I was on the corner slangin' crack
You grabbed the pistol when them coppaz pulled me ova
I be full of marijuana but you convinced em I was sober
As in can recall you was there through it all
You accepetd every collect call
From 2-lane an braud
Neva asked me for a dime
Girl I neva forget
An at times it's hard to pleese you
But you worked til sweat
Sometimes I wonder if I'm doin enough
To let ya know
Ill make this world yours
If you promise not to go (this world is yourz baby)
Yo love is all that I need to suceed in life
So would you think about bein my wife
Ha ha ha ha

(chorus)


Often reminicin' certain situations
Our vaction
We got horny so we did it in my exposition ( you so nasty)
I gave the invitation
An girl you must love me 'cause I swear there was no hesitation
You always find time to pleese me
So I left da pictures alone
'cause yo lovin' is off da heezey
I neva thought that I could settle down
Livin' in this crime land
'cause it's hard being a thug and an honest man
So now I'm beggin fo' forgivness
All the sins I committed
All the lies an the bullshit
Its me an you against this fuckin so-called "life"
So would you think about bein my wife"
Ha ha ha ha

(chorus)

You wasn't raised as a thug but you thugged fo' me
That's how I know u got love fo' me
Always ready to die fo' this nigga
You were my closest friend
Everytime I cried you held my until the very end
That's why I hustle fo' that greed 'cause if it makes you smile
Then ima die tryin make it mine
Got soo much love fo' ya how can I explain
All these feelings I feel
Any nigga that touch ya ima rush him
I promise to kill
Me an you we inseprable
An every time we make love baby girl
Its unforgetable
Fuck it what's mine is yours
'cause you the lite of my life
So would u think about bein my wife?
Ha ha ha ha
