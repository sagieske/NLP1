Song:

You lying f*****g w***e
I don't want you anymore
I don't need your f*****g lies and that's for sure

No matter if you cry
I don't care if you would die
So f**k yourself you b***h cause you're the glitch

But it hurts to sing this song
And in my heart I know I'm doing wrong

You f*****g antichrist
You made yourself my kryptonite
If I would like some cola you'll be cola light

Your doing is not right
You're not even worth the fight
Cause honey I want cola but you're cola light

Your not even worth a piss
You gave your bestfriend one of your kiss
God I hate you f**k your self you f*****g w***e

But it hurts to sing this song
And in my heart I know I'm doing wrong
But it hurts to sing this song
And in my heart I know I'm doing wrong

You f*****g w***e you son of a b***h why can't you die
I hate your f*****g lies you f*****g a** hole
You punk a** m**********are damn you and your lies
You can go and f**k your bestfriend hope you both will die.

But it hurts to sing this song
And in my heart I know I'm doing wrong
But it hurts to sing this song
And in my heart I know I'm doing wrong
