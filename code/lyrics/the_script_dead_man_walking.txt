Song:

(I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man)
(-repeat-)

I see you standing there but you're already gone
I'm holding your hand but you're barely holding on
I'm kissin your lips but it just don't feel the same
Am I dead man now, left living with the blame

Oh I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking

Already broken, already gone, already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking, dead man, walking
Already see it, in your face, already someone, in my place
I'm a breathing, talking, dead man, walking

I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man

We're in the same room just one million miles away
With all these books around but we ain't go two words to say
Am I a dead man now, left living with the shame?

I'm... Already broken, already gone, already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking, dead man walking
Already see it, in your face already someone, in my place
I'm a breathing, talking, dead man walking yeah
I'm a breathing, talking dead man walking

I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man walking walking walking
I hear the angels talking talking talking
Now I'm a dead man

I'm already broken, already gone already know you're moving on
I'm a breathing, talking dead man walking
Already see it, in your face, already someone in my place
I'm a breathing, talking dead man walking

I'm a breathing, talking dead man walking
