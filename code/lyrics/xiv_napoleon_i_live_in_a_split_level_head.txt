Song:

I? Ve lived in apartments, I? Ve lived in a home
I travelled in trailers when I used to roam
But now in these places you won? T have me dead
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I do what I want to, no worries, no care
If anyone bugs me I climb up my stairs
Way up to a level where I feel no threat
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

If you? Re trying something, I couldn? T care less
I don? T rush for busses and trains are a mess
There? S no one to care for, I don? T need a bed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I like how I? M living, I? M nobody? S slave
My head? S above water, so don? T make a wave
There are no doors to lock and no dogs to be fed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

So why should I move when the neighborhood? S right?
No taxes to pay and no landlord to fight
Now I call this living, what? S more, like I said
? Cause I'm happy I live in a split-level head

Now you keep your ulcers, your ills, and what, too
You sure couldn? T have them and live like I do
You think I hace problems, but you do instead
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

I live with two people, I like both of them
He likes both of me and I like both of him
They? Re my alter-ego and to them I? M wed
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head

There? S no simple status in my neighborhood
And its that kind of thinking, that keeps it so good
And I don? T take the lead when I like to be led
? Cause I? M happy I live in a split-level head
