Song:

Strike up the band, let's start a fire
Put up your hands, show your desire
If you want this, don't hold back.
Asked you to stand like one of the choir
Lift up your voice, build it up higher
In this moment, don't look back.

Cause tonight, the stars are in your eyes
Tonight, our arms are opened wide

I don't want to be anywhere else
And if I have to give all of myself
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you

Lost in the sounds, a song in your head
Jumping around, nothing compares to this moment
And nothing ever will

Cause tonight, the stars are in your eyes
Tonight, our arms are opened wide

I don't want to be anywhere else
And if I have to give all of myself
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you

A million eyes stare into space
Not you and I, we're face to face
I don't want to be anywhere else but here

Turn the whole world upside down - let's pour it out
Let's all reach for higher ground while we're looking down

Strike up the band, let's start a fire
Put up your hands, show your desire
If you want this, don't hold back

I don't want to be anywhere else
And if I have to give all of myself
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you

A million eyes stare into space
Not you and I, we're face to face
I don't want to be anywhere else but here with you.
