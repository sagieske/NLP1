Song:

[Refrain x2: Pharrell]
My love

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Wins and never quits
Quits and never wins
I thought about what I wanted
And you were on my list

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Remember where I was?Annotate
In the desert with no love
No cactus's, just dust
And you swept me from above

[Refrain: Both]
My love

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good
Good

[Chorus: Both]
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new
You got me feelin' brand new
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me

[Refrain x2: Both]
My love

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Life to me is easy
People make it complicated
When love is the tool
No reason we can't make it

[Verse 4: Justin Timberlake]
Come on, let's go, be brave
Feel somethin' at the [?]
Once we know that amaze
Then give it all the way

[Refrain: Both]
My love

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good
Good

[Chorus: Both]
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new
You got me feelin' brand new
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me

[Bridge: Both]
All my life, when I describe
What I want, I've been misunderstood
The more I try, at bein' satisfied
And didn't think that I could
But then you came along, and you made me strong
Like God said you would

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good
Good

[Chorus: Both]
Honey, you got me feelin' brand new
You got me feelin' brand new
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
