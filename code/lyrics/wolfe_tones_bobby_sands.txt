Would you like to try a cheeseburger Bobby Sands?
Would you like to try a cheeseburger Bobby Sands?
Would you like to try a cheeseburger,
You dirty melly fenian, rebel loving f****are?
Would you like to try a cheeseburger Bobby Sands?

Well your ma was up this morning and she says she got your brew,
Well your ma was up this morning and she says she got your brew,
Well your ma was up this morning and she says she got your brew,
But sure your brew would be no good to you,
Theres a bed made, in Milltown just for you.

Well I'm going for my dinner now Bobby Sands,
Well I'm going for my dinner now Bobby Sands,
Well I'm going for my dinner now,
Would you like me to bring you back a doggy bag?
Theres a bed made in Milltown just for you.

Well the smell of your cell would knock you f*****g out,
Well the smell of your cell would knock you f*****g out,
Well the smell of your cell would knock you f*****g out,
I've a good mind to go in there and beat you about,
There's a bed made in Milltown just for you.

Well I'm going for my dinner now Bobby Sands,
Well I'm going for my dinner now Bobby Sands,
Well I'm going for my dinner now,
Would you like me to bring you back a doggy bag?
Theres a bed made in Milltown just for you.

Would you like to try a nice wee tin of Coke (Bobby Sands)?
Would you like to try a nice wee tin of Coke (Bobby Sands)?
Would you like to try a nice wee tin of Coke?
Well your not f*****g getting none, I hope you choke,
There's a bed made in Milltown just for you.
