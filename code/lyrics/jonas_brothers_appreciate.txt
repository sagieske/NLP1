Song:

There's a man dying on the side of the road,
Won't make it home tonight.
He was driving fast on his cell phone,
That's how he lived his life.
And while he was hangin' by a thread
These were the final words he said

[Chorus:]
My girl turns sweet sixteen today,
She's beautiful, so beautiful.
It might get rough sometimes
But I hope she keeps her faith.[hope she keeps her faith]
I wish I grabbed a chance to say to her
Life is too short so take the time and appreciate

There's a woman crying on the kitchen floor,
She got a call tonight.
Now she's trembling outside her daughter's door
Walks in and holds her tight
Wondering how and where to start,
Is there a way to shield her heart?

[Chorus:]
My girl turns sweet sixteen today,
She's beautiful, so beautiful.
It might get rough sometimes but I hope she keeps her faith.[hope she keeps her faith]
I wish I grabbed the chance to say to her
Life is too short so take the time and Appreciate

Any but a lovin' way
It heard along the way
Don't be afraid to open up
And use the time you have before it fades
Show your love today!

[Chorus:]
My girl turns sweet sixteen today,
She's beautiful, so beautiful.
It might get rough sometimes
But I hope she keeps her faith.[hope she keeps her faith]
I wish I grabbed the chance to say to her
Life is too short so take the time and appreciate.
Life is too short so take the time and appreciate.
