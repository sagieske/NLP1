Song:

In touch with myself
Feel your touch like glass
Standing in the way of something new
Private confusion now public view
Problems in the way of "solving you"

Chorus:
Half Full of Happiness
Record playing lovers game.
Just room for loneliness.
As empty days, overflow.

Half Full of Happiness
Record playing lovers game.
In this loneliness, 
Empty days overflow.

Simple choices left
Left to complicate
Know only half of what I say
Rumors feed a hungry mind
And I can't peel away from these
Four walls.

Chorus:
Half Full of Happiness
Record playing lovers game.
Just room for loneliness
As empty days, overflow.

Half Full of Happiness
Record playing lovers game.
In this loneliness, 
Empty days overflow.
