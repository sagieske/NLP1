Song:

Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about 
And it's definitely not a particle that's nearby. 
It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing, 
It's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion 
Because the flashes come around almost on time. 

As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock, 
About maybe ten or twelve diameters. 
I don't know whether that does you any good, 
But there's something out there.
