I Lyrics and Words by Lawrence Gowan
From his album Strange Animal

You've seen my hands are steady
You've seen my face before
Soon you can take your last look
And they'll close the door
I stand accused before you
I have no tears to cry
And you will never break me
Until the day I die

A criminal mind was all I
All I've ever known
They've tried to reform me
Cause I'm made of cold stone

My criminal mind is all I
All I've ever had
Ask one who's known me
If I'm really so bad...
I am

I've spent my life behind these steel bars
I've paid my debt in time
But being brought to justice
That was my only crime
I don't regret action
I'd do the same again
These prison walls secure me
And I'm numb to pain

A criminal mind was all I
All I've ever known
They've tried to reform me
But I'm made of cold stone

My criminal mind is all I
All I've ever had
Ask one who's known me
If I'm really so bad...
I am

Before you hand me over
Before you read my sentence
I'd like to say a few words
Here in my own defense
Some people struggle daily
They struggle with their conscience 'til the end
I have no guilt to haunt me
I feel no wrong intent

A criminal mind is all I
All I've ever known
Don't try to reform me
Cause I'm made of cold stone

My criminal mind is all I
All I've ever had
Ask one who's known me
If I'm really so bad...
I am

Oh I am
Oh I am
I'm made of cold stone
Made of cold stone
I'm just like these prison walls
A criminal mind
