Song:

Yeah, yeah I scream...
With you on my mind so heavy and so hard
I don't know quite everything
You make me think of a better thing...
Better things to fill my day with
But they don't mean to go
Please don't be too bad with me, God
Please don't be too good...
Let some women's light, women's light
Chain my hands with me singing...

Hani, Hani, come and dance with me
Whoa, whoa, sooner there
Hani, Hani, come and dance with me
Only the brave
Hani Hani, come and dance with me
(feeling the night)
Hani, Hani, come and dance with me
Lead me back home to life

You made Heaven turn to dirt
And dirt turn to dance on
Heaven come my way
Baby surely do
Maybe some moonlight
Maybe some, baby surely do
Maybe some moonlight
Say this say this...

Hani, Hani, come and dance for me
Underneath the moonlight
Hani, Hani, come and dance for me

Hani, Hani, come and dance for me
Come on, come on go
Hani, Hani, come and dance for me
Give it back, give it back....

Oh man, I can't talk
A man was tall and once tore a piece of freedom for us all
When, then, you least expect it
Man can cut from of his own heart
For us all, that man
Don't believe it, oh yeah....
God, two men slice and dice eachother up in his place
They don't believe it...
Well leave it
Leave it lying, leave it lying, leave it lying
Got me singing
Hani, Hani, come and dance for me
