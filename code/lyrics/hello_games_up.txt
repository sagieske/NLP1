Song:

Game's up
Darling don't even know your name
You'll soon be my latest flame
I've been keeping my eye on you
I found out your secrets too
I'm gonna make you mine
Don't run away let me on the line
No matter how much you pay
You'll soon be hearing me say

Game's up baby I know
Baby I know

Baby I know your number;
Baby I know
Baby I know

Baby I know your number.
Can't you see what I'm going through
Just trying to get to you
Calling though you just won't reply
But baby I'll try and try
Get the operator
She'll put me through and a minute later.
I'll get a message to you
And baby soon as I do

Game's up baby I know
Baby I know
.. .

Game's up baby I know
Baby I know
