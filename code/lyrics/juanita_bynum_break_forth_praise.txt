Song:

[Part One:]
Oh give thanks unto the Lord
Oh break forth with a praise in one accord
Make known among the nations what he has done
Sing praises unto his name [x2]

[Part Two:]
Oh give thanks unto the Lord
Oh break forth with a praise in one accord
Forget not all his benefits and all that he has done
Sing praises to his name [x2]

[Bridge:]
Wonderful, Counselor
Mighty God You are, Prince of Peace [x2]

[Run:]
Clap your hands, and do your dance, and shout and sing
Let the praises ring [x8]

Clap your hands! [x4]

Do your dance! [x2]

Let the praises ring! [x15]

Clap your hands, do your dance, and shout and sing
Let the praises ring!

Clap your hands, Clap your hands

Let the praises ring!
