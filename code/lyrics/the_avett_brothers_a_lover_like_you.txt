Song:

Do I need to tell you?
I don't need to be untrue
Not when I have a lover like you.

Now it don't take that much thought
Not with all the love you've got
And you give it to me free
Some might take that for granted but certainly not me
No not when I have a lover like you

I haven't eyes for anyone else
I'm thinking of you and nobody else
I haven't eyes for anyone else but you
Yooouuu....

She may be all on my case
Want to kiss me on my face
Put my hands on her waist
Take me back to her place
I would happily follow
But not when I have a lover like you.

I haven't eyes for anyone else
I'm thinking of you and nobody else
I haven't eyes for anyone else but you
But yooouuu....
But yooouuu....
But yooouuu....
But yooouuu....
