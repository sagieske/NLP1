Beautiful One - Tim Hughes
Wonderful, so wonderful
Is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard
No heart could fully know
How glorious, how beautiful you are!
Beautiful One I love
Beautiful One I adore
Beautiful One my soul must sing
Powerful, so powerful
Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty
Awakes my heart to sing
How marvellous, how wonderful You are
You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew
You captured my heart with this love
Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as You
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
Beautiful One
