Song:

Alabama High-Test
Got me in a big mess
Higher then a wildcat
Running from the wolf pack
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that
Alabama High-Test

65 southbound
Cruising with a half pound
Blue lights spinning round
Better put the hammer down
Dirt road, Tennessee
Ain't nobody stopping me
Short run, state line, gotta keep making time
Alabama High-Test

Huff paint, cocaine, playing chicken with a train
Smack dab, Meth lab, mellow-out, rehab
Percocet, cigarette, I don't need no more of that
Just gimme some down home, Dixie-fried, homegrown
Alabama High-Test

Alabama High-Test
Alabama High-Test
Got me in a big mess
Running from the wolf pack
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that
Alabama High-Test

Drug bust, disgust, plead with the circuit judge
"Son, don't be coy, send you up, the river, boy
Jump suit, cain gang, shackles on my feet and hand
Standing on I-65 wishing I was rolling by with
Alabama High-Test

Alabama High-Test
Alabama High-Test
Got me in a big mess
Higher then a wildcat
They're gonna put me in the slammer
If they catch me with that
Alabama High-Test
