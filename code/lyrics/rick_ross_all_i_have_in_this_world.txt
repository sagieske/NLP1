Song:

Okay, I'm reloaded
The homey, Elvis Presley and Rick Ross teen
Be back, I'm back
I'm back, I'm back
It's nowhere to go

I'm talkin' Japanese denim, money stuffed in 'em
The coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Hey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby, work it till it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

I left the pistol in the house and I let's my b***h drive
Twenty this change I goes to this five
No it's not the solid treatment I let's the b***h vibe
Fire up the kush she hit it now this far

Now imagine how she look with ked, a** and thick thighs
Put her on the payroll 'cuz flat out she get's down
See that a** from the side that's before she sits down
And her mouth get wet as a bottle of Crystal

N****s lookin' at me, pa, but I'm packin' a pistol
F**k, kicked out, b***h, I'm tearin this s**t down
Yeah, my Chevy sittin' high so it's hard to get down
Watch that d**k standin' up, girl, it's hard to get down

Got them chickens in the dress so I hardly sit down
Some problem Alphabet Boys, hit them charges to stick now
B***h, you ain't gotta guess it's me and Mannie Fresh
You know we gettin' money by the way a n***a dress

I'm talkin' Japanese denim, money stuffed in 'em
The coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Hey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby, work it till it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Smokin' us a teefer name of the reefer
The cloud so thick, p***y n***a, I don't see ya
Your hoe so thick, p***y n***a, she don't see ya
Your hoe so thick, p***y n***a, she don't need ya

My hoes so thick, p***y n***a, they ain't nothin'
I don't love that hoe, p***y n***a, there ain't nothin'
My money so long, his money ain't nothin'
My money in front of me, his money just frontin'

You know the routine in movin' a few things
Rollin' on two Benz in them new blue jeans
Japanese denim money stuffed in 'em
Twenty something cars, m**********are, I'm winnin'

I'm talkin' Japanese denim, money stuffed in 'em
The coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Hey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby, work it till it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Sippin' on that Remy outside of the club
Got me trippin' like I'm Remy outside of the club
Yeah, them b*****s comin' with me, I'm shinin' like a bug
I don't even think it's tricky just temporary love

Chickens pullin' on my shirt, I'm just worried about the chains
Tattoos [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] I debut Lebron James
Came back Mike Vick I buried ya dog brains

Y'all ducks want the birds if not just keep walkin'
Got the top down and I'm feelin' like Steve Austin
You know the routine, still movin' a few things
Rollin', I'm too biz in them new blue jeans

Japanese denim, money stuffed in 'em
The coolest of the cars and the baddest of the women
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

Hey, I'ma work it on the corner, work it on the block
Work it till they love me, baby, work it till it's hot
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have in this world, all I have in this world
