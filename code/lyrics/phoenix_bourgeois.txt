Song:

Darling you never know
It started years ago
When you're less than kind of done
An adolescent singing out real loud
Some wild English tune
Sing sha la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up

How it all began
Seriously dumb
When you're less than kind of certain
An adolescent calling out real loud
It's what the singer do
Sing sha la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up

You bet your life on the cruise ship
Bartending crucial lies
We're destined, wise and we socialize

Bourgeois
Why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois
Your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything

Darling you'll never know
Darling you'll never know
When you're less than kind of done
Adolescence's looking at you now
Like foreign legions do
Sing sha la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
We'll never talk it out this time
You'll learn from all of us
When your time's up

You lost your mind on a cruise ship
Bartending crucial lies
We're destined, wise and we socialize

Bourgeois
Why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois
Your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything

Bourgeois
Why would you care for more?
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
Bourgeois
Your fire's a false alarm
They gave you almost everything
You believed almost anything
