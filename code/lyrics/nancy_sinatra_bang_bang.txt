Song:

Bang Bang...
My Baby Shot Me Down

Nancy Sinatra

I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang
He shot me down, bang bang
I hit the ground , bang bang
That awful sound, bang bang
My baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang
I shot you down, bang bang
You hit the ground , bang bang
That awful sound, bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang...
Just for me the church bells rang...

Now he's gone I don't know why
And till this day some times I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang
He shot me down, bang bang
I hit the ground , bang bang
That awful sound, bang bang
My baby shot me down.
