Song:

It's gonna make sense

Ah... ah... ah... 
Ah... ah... ah... ah... 

Life comes in many shapes
You think you know what you got
Until it changes

And life will take you high and low
You gotta learn how to walk
And then which way to go

Every choice you make
When you're lost
Every step you take
Has it's cause

Chorus:
After you clear your eyes
You'll see the light
Somewhere in the darkness
After the rain has gone
You'll feel the sun come
And though it seems your sorrow never ends
Someday it's gonna make sense

Ah... ah... ah... ah... 

Tears you shed are all the same
When you laughed 'till you cried
Or broken down in pain

All the hours you have spent in the past
Worrying about
A thing that didn't last

Everything you saw
Played a part
In everything you are
In your heart

Chorus:
After you clear your eyes
You'll see the light
Somewhere in the darkness
After the rain has gone
You'll feel the sun comes
And though it seems your sorrow never ends... 

Release:
Someday you're gonna find the answers
To all the things you've become and all they've done
At your expense
Someday it's gonna make sense

Ah... ah... ah... 
Ah... ah... ah... ah... 

After the rain has gone
You'll feel the sun comes
And though it seems your sorrow never ends

Someday it's gonna make sense
Ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... 
Someday it's gonna make sense

After the rain has gone
You'll feel the sun comes
And though it seems your sorrow never ends

Someday it's gonna make sense
