Song:

I never thought I could forget you,
I never thought I'd be the man I am now,
It's 20 seconds since I left you,
Cause I could never be your lover,
I found another girl to mess me 'round,
So you don't get to make me suffer,
Look into my eyes there's really nothing left to lose,
But I know that I'm never coming back to you

Love goes cold,
Blood, tears and gold,
Wont make it any better,
I never let you down baby, baby,
I never let you down baby, baby,
And it wont get any better,
Blood, tears and gold

It's 20 seconds since I've left you,
And I remember why I never looked back,
I got no reason to forgive you,
I see it in your eyes,
The suffering it hides the blue,
But I know, that's it never gonna hide the truth, the truth, baby

Love goes cold,
Blood, tears and gold,
Wont make it any better,
I never let you down baby, baby,
I never let you down baby, baby,
And it wont get any better,
Blood, tears and gold

Love goes cold,
Blood, tears and gold,
Wont make it any better

When love goes cold,
Blood, tears and gold,
Wont make it any better,
I never let you down baby, baby,
I never let you down baby, baby,
And it wont get any better,
Blood, tears and gold
