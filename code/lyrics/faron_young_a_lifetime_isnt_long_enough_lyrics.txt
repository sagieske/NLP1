Song:

(Virginia Midgett - Arthur Korb)
A lifetime isn't long enough
To be in love with you
To prove how much I care sweetheart
The way I want to do.
A lifetime isn't long enough
I couldn't even start
In twice that time to tell you have
The things within my heart.
If I could live a million years
Then maybe I'd have time
To make you really understand
How glad I am you're mine.
I love you more and more each day
Until my life is through
But a lifetime isn't long enough
To be in love with you.
If I could live a million years
And then a million more
I never could grow tired of sayin'
It's you I adore.
Long as I live my life is yours
My heart and my love too
But a lifetime isn't long enough
To be in love with you...
