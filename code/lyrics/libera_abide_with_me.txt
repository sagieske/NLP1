Song:

Abide With Me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

Swift to it's close ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim, it's glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see
O Thou who changes not, abide with me

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting? Where grave thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me

Help of the helpless, O abide with me
