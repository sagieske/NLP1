Song:

I'm popular and poppin dough
Breakfast at Papa Deaux's
Dodgin all obstacles
Trappin at the Stop-N-Go
Boy you know you lame if you still ridin stop and go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Pardon though I'm hardin though
You should read the article
I'm ridin high and dodgin hoes
You better hope I'm dodgin your model hoes
Dollar hoes, white lookin Madonna hoes
Dolce Gabbana, Ferragamo and the Prada hoes
College hoes on three, niggaz with a lot of dough
I Snoop guard the dough, I just love bein by the stove
Heres some food for thought, a little food for your soul
Like a comma, I love bein right next to O's

I had a long day, my nerves bad
Yea I'm smokin on loud I know you heard that
Hit the jewlery store, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Leave the trap house, with a hundred grand
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands
Time to re-up, I got a hundred bands
I can't help it I'm addicted to the rubberbands

We sittin high speakin like we super human Benz
Cars mulatto, black on black Europeans
Too hard to swallow like UGKings and
Number one thesis do you believe in Jesus
They say money is the root of all diseases
Well call the doctor I see honest in my thesis
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
Baby momma sayin I'm impatient my sons need shit
When you pull up to the front, all you see is whips
Diddy bop to the back all you see is zips
In Ziplocks, and garbage bags
Usher Raymond in this bitch yeah "I got it bad"

(2 Chainz! ) My plug need me, but he greedy
I ran off told me catch me on the TV
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
I'm yellin fuck the world I woke up with my dick hard
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Pussy on lock down, I don't handcuff it
Sippin Grey Goose and we spendin mad ducats
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flaps, I got bunyons on bunyons
Yellow ring look like a Funyon, or somethin
I just left the trap house, money on money
