Song:

[Ryan:]
Mucho Gusto

[Sharpay:]
Aye que fabulosa
Rrrrr aye aye aye

[Ryan and Sharpay:]
Arrriba

[Sharpay:]
Ð‡Quieres bailar?

[Ryan:]
Mirame

[Sharpay:]
I believe in dreaming
And shooting for the stars

[Ryan:]
Baby to be number one
You got to raise the bar

[Sharpay:]
Kicking and the scatching
Grinding out my best

[Ryan:]
Anything it takes to climb
The ladder of success

[Both:]
Work our tails off everyday
Gotta bump the competition
Blow them all away

[Ryan:]
Caliente

[Sharpay:]
Suave

[Sharpay:]
Yeah we're gonna

[Both:]
Bop bop bop, bop to the top

[Ryan:]
Slip and slide and ride that rhythm

[Both:]
Jump and hop
Hop til we drop

[Both:]
Zip zap zop hop, walk like a mop

[Ryan:]
Scoot around the corner

[Both:]
Move it to the groove
'Til the music stops
Do the bop bop bop
To the top
Don't ever stop
Bop to the top
Gimme gimme
Shimmy shimmy
Shake some booty and turn around
Flash a smile in their direction

[Sharpay:]
Show some muscle

[Ryan:]
Do the hustle

[Sharpay:]
Yeah we're gonna

[Both:]
Bop bop bop, bop to the top

[Ryan:]
Wipe away your inhibitions

[Both:]
Stump stump stump, do the rump

[Sharpay:]
And start your stuff

[Both:]
Bop bop bop, straight to the top
Going for the glory

[Ryan:]
We'll keep stepping up and we just won't stop

[Sharpay:]
(Stop)

[Both:]
Till we reach the top
Bop to the top
