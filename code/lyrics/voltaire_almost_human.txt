Song:

What did I ever do to you
That you should treat me this way?
Is it really such a crime
For an angel to speak his mind?
In time I'll try to she'd some light
If I were a big boy I wouldn't cry
But since I'm not a big boy I'll have to cry

What did I ever do so wrong
That you should cast me from grace
Though I love to rule in hell here
How I miss the taste of heaven
It's soft and cool embrace
If I were a big boy I wouldn't cry
But since I'm not a big boy
I'll have to close my eyes
And picture what's it's like

I'm just like you
I'm made by him
Despised by they
I'm almost me
I'm nearly human look at me
I'm almost a human being
I'm just like you
Made by him
Despised by they
I'm almost me
I'm nearly human
Pity me I'm almost a human being

I still remember your light
It was streaming down
And burning out my eyes
If I were a big boy I wouldn't cry
But since I'm not a big boy
I'll have to close my eyes
And picture what it's like

I'm just like you
I'm made by him
Despised by they
I'm almost me
I'm nearly human look at me
I'm almost a human being

There tears are real
I'm jealousy I'm spite and hate
To the core I'm mean
I'm nearly human look at me
I'm almost a human being
I'm just like you
Better than he
To hell with they
I'm almost me
I'm nearly human
Pity me I'm almost a human being

Don't touch me
I couldn't bear the thought of it now
Don't touch me
I couldn't bear the strength
Don't touch me
I couldn't bear the thought of it now
Touch me touch me touch me
Don't touch me touch me touch me
