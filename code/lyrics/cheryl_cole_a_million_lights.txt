Song:

[Verse]
I'm wondering how we fell through
Got a little too much in my head,
Like I miss you
Each passing light reminds me
Nothing could lift me from the dark
Till I found you
Every day goes running
With the same flow
But there's always something
Washed away

[Chorus:]
I don't know how we fell through
Got a little too much in my head,
Like I miss you
A million lights behind you
I'm a little too much in the dark,
Here without you

[Verse]
No one leaning on me
Nothing here to hold me
Moving where I choose, alone
But rolling so free
There's nothing here to stop me
Filling up my head with me and you

[Chorus:]
I don't know how we fell through
Got a little too much in my head,
Like I miss you
A million lights behind you
I'm a little too much in the dark
When I can't see you
No telling where the future flows
But before it goes
You and me you know we've got to try
Before the chance flies
Honey this is our time
Don't be one of those
Sweet fools standing on the kerb
Watching life pass by

[Chorus:]
Don't tell me how we fell through
Got a little too much in my head,
Like I miss you
A million lights behind you
I'm a little too much in the dark
Here without you
