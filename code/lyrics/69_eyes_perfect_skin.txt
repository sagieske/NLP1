Song:

You got a perfect skin,
With a Devils grin.

Say hello to the pretty eyes,
Say hello to the deadliest lies.
You got the looks, baby,
I could die.
You got the looks.
You got a murder style.

(Frist sin)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby.
(Who's in perfect skin)
It's getting hot,
Who's going to rescue me?
(Nothing in)
You got a perfect skin,
With a Devil's grin.

Say hello to the pretty eyes,
Say hello perfect alibis.
Shake your hips, baby,
I could die.
Shake your hips,
You got an L. A. Style

(First sin)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby.
(Who's in perfect skin)
It's getting hot,
Who's going to rescue me?
(Nothing in)
You got a perfect skin,
With a Devil's grin.
You got a perfect skin,
Eyes like sin.

Jenna.
Paris.
Jessica.
Marilyn.
Jayne.
Madonna.

You got the looks, baby,
I could die.
You got the looks.
You got a murder style.

(First sin)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby.
(Who's in perfect skin)
It's getting hot,
Who's going to rescue me?
(Nothing in)

Its okay, that's alright now,
But I ain't going to burn in flames.
Let it go now.
Let it go now.

(First sin)
You can't keep me waiting forever, baby.
(Who's in perfect skin)
It's getting hot,
Who's going to rescue me?
(Nothing in)

You got a perfect skin.
You got a perfect skin,
With a devils grin.
Perfect skin.
With a devils grin.
Perfect skin
