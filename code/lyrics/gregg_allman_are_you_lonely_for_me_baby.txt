Song:

One two three four
(Are you lonely for me baby)
I love you all the time
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Yeah I'm coming home, coming home baby
(Are you lonely for me baby)

Oh yeah the last train to Jacksonville
Gonna get on it baby, you know I will
Will you try, go ahead and try
Forget all the pain that I brought ya
Gonna give it a try
Lord go ahead and try
But I know that I'm the one that told ya
You gotta be lonely baby, lonely fool
But I'm lonely baby, lonely for you

(Are you lonely for me baby)
But I see you crying
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Gonna gonna gonna hold you baby
(Are you lonely for me baby)

Aww the last truck to Jacksonville
Are you my sweet baby, are you still
Tell your friend this is the end lord
I'm coming to beg your forgiveness
While I can hear your laugh
I can hear the honkey blue laugh
You were saying that I'm the one that always hurt you
Go ahead and let'em laugh, go ahead and laugh
Though I never will desert you
But I'm lonely baby, lonely fool
But I'm lonely for you
Oh oh baby

(Are you lonely for me baby)
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Oh you know that I am
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Come on, come on, pretty baby I said

Oh it's a long ride to Jacksonville
Gonna get on it baby, you know I will
Will you be there, lord will you be there
When I get off the train girl
You gotta to be there, lord you gotta be there
When I step off that train girl
Beacuse I'm lonley baby, lonely fool
I'm lonely baby, lonely for you

(Are you lonely for me baby)
Oh baby you know that I am
(Are you lonely for me baby)
All three of you one time, ha ha
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Yeah yeah awww
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Oh pack your things
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Oh you know that I am
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Come a come a come a come oh oh
(Are you lonely for me baby)
Oh baby you know that I am
(Are you lonely)
