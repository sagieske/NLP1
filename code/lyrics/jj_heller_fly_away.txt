Song:

Stars call me closer
The earth is dragging me down
I want to be more than hungry
I want to live somewhere other than this old gray town

I want to fly away far beyond my cage
Where I hear freedom singing
You are telling me again there's no door to keep me in
I hear freedom singing

Beauty all around me
Drawing me to the sky
This is life I can feel it
Bid my lonely days goodbye

Chorus

Fly away home, fly away home, fly away home to you,
