Song:

I believe in homicide I rest my case,
Don't cast a sigh you'd better believe it,
That's the truth of it take it or leave it,
Resign to it homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide
No one cares when someone lies
They'd rather say that it's a red alert
You'd better believe it,
That's the truth of it take it or leave it,
Resign to it homicide, homicide, homicide,
Homicide homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide
You try to tell me it's his fault because he's down

And let him lose this homicide all over town
I'll take enough but I'll take it down what's your address,
I'll write it down I'll be in touch so don't leave town
In a big black car (solo) homicide, homicide, homicide
I believe in homicide I rest my case, don't cast a
Sigh you'd better believe it, that's the truth of it,
Take it or leave it, resign to it homicide, homicide,
Homicide ,homicide homicide, homicide, homicide
Homicide homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide
Homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi
Homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi, homi
Homicide
