Song:

Gotta bring all that back
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you

I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Gotta bring all that back

You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I gotta bring all that back
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You gotta bring all that back
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
I'mma have to charge you

Ok, my drive is a substantial amount 'cause this what I charge
You should see that whip I got in my garage
That thing look like a Phantom, Rrari, mixed with a Ghost
That front reel look just like that Aston Martin mixed with a horse
That brick cost 20, I'mma charge you 30, see how smart you are
Got choppers, all beamers, make your head like a b***h, I don't care how hard you is
And yeah, I'mma charge you that
Gotta bring all that back

I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Gotta bring all that back

You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I gotta bring all that back
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You gotta bring all that back
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
I'mma have to charge you

'I'm killing so many, I am on 30s, the f**k is a 20?
Taking it harder, we do it like penny and I got Ls on top of the semi
Busting those n****s, I'm skinning and grinning
Winning, you seen my team up in here?
Food on my plate, n***a hustle game up in here
' I cry for my homie, I catch him here I'mma eat off his ear
Bite out his face, snatch out his heart, this s**t is gruesome, that's what I charge
I'm flying, I'm crying, I'm laughing, I'm lying'

I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
I'mma charge you
Gotta bring all that back

You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I gotta bring all that back
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
You gotta bring all that back
You know I'm tryna run up a sack
I'mma have to charge you this
I'mma have to charge you that
I'mma have to charge you
