Song:

Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh

Oh, when you were young
Did you ever love someone
So much you couldn't bare the thought of losing them
Well I remember the sleepless nights
When I'd lie awake
If only I could tell you how I feel

Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh
Sleepless at night
Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh
Well I remember the sleeplessnights
Oehhhh-oehhh-ooehhh
Sleepless at night

Well I would walk around the earth
To have another chance with you
Spend the evening, paining thoughts of all you do
Well I remember the sleeplesnights
When I'd lie awake
If only I could tell you how I feel

Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh
Sleepless at night
Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh
Well I remember the sleeplessnights
Oehhhh-oehhh-ooehhh
Sleepless at night

Sleepless at niiight
Have you ever loved someone?
Hard to fiiind
Have you ever loved someone?
Could you ever love someone?

Ohnoooo

Oehhh-oehhhh-ooehhh

Well I remember the sleeplesnights
When I'd lie awake
Fix me I'm on my own
Well I remember the sleeplesnights
When I'd lie awake
Fix me I'm on my own
Well I remember the sleeplesnights
When I'd lie awake
Fix me I'm on my own
Well I remember the sleeplesnights
When I'd lie awake
If only I could tell you how I feel
