Song:

Wake me from my disenchanting paper dreams
Shake me from my drunken deadly sleep
Take me to my healing sweet Virginia please
They've broken my reflection
And I am in need

Take apart the smiles they've stapled to my face
Make them take the needles out of me
Help me stitch these stinging cuts where I still bleed
They've broken my reflection
And I am in need

Soak me in the sunshine
Rinse me in the rain
The smell of hate surrounds me
And I want to love again
Wrap me in the feathers lost from angel's wings
They've broken my reflection
And I am in need

Seconds leave my life just like the wind leaves me
Minutes fall like dead November leaves
If I have betrayed you Lord with my conceit
I'm begging your forgiveness
Cause I am in need

Soak me in the sunshine
Rinse me in the rain
The smell of hate surrounds me
And I want to love again
Wrap me in the feathers lost from angel's wings
They've broken my reflection
And I am in need
