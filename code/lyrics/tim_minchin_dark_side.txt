Song:

I can have a dark side,
If you want me to,
I can have a dark side,
I can develop my brooding potential,
If pain's what you want in a act,
Pain I can do,
I can have a dark side, too
I can have a dark side... Too,
Yippe!

I called my girlfriend up on the phone
I said, "Hey g-girlfriend what's g-going wrong?"
She said, "I'm breaking it off with you
I feel as if the m-m-magic has gone. "
I said, "Hey baby, what you talking about?
I thought that everything was just fine. "
She said, "That's exactly the point
I just get so annoyed how you're so happy all the time
I need somebody deeper than you
Someone with a little third-dimension. "

I said,
Well, I can have a dark side
If you want me to
I can have a dark side
I can develop my brooding potential
If pain's what you want in a man
Pain I can do
I can have a dark side, too
I can have a dark side
I can have a dark side
I can have a dark side
Ohh, Yeah, Ohh...
Yippie!

I wrote a letter to Mr Sony
I said, "Hey S-sony what's g-going down?
I've got a record and I reckon it's wicked
And I th-think you should s-spread it around. "
He said, "Hey Tim, I quite like your work
He said, "It's clever and quirky
But I promise you this:
You could be clever as Voltaire
But it won't get you nowhere
If you wanna sell discs
Clever never made no one rich
It doesn't appeal to the teenage market
The teenage market! "

Well,
I can have a dark side
If you want me to
I can have a dark side
I can reveal my tortured internals
If pain's what you want in an act
Pain I can do
I can have a dark side, too
I can have a dark side, too

Jeremy has spoken at last

Daddy never came to my ball games
Where were you daddy?
Daddy never came to my ball games
He never loved me
Daddy never came to my ball games (Daddy never came!)
Daddy never came to my ball games (Daddy never came!)
Daddy never came to my ball games
Daddy never came!
He's only sleeping...

I, I can have a dark side
If you want me to
If you want me to
Yeah I, I can have a dark side
If you want me to
I, I can have a dark side
If you want me to
If you want me to
Yeah I, I can have a dark side
If you want me to
I, I can have a dark side,
If you want me to,
If you want me to
