Song:

How can I just
Let you walk away?
Just let you leave
Without a trace
When I stand here
Taking every breath
With you, ooh
You're the only one
Who really knew me
At all

How can you just
Walk away from me,
When all I can do
Is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared
The laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now,
Who has just an empty space
And there's nothing left here
To remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Well take a look at me now,
Who has just an empty space
And you coming back to me
Is against the odds
And that's
What I've got to face

I wish I could
Just make you turn around,
Turn around to see me cry
There's so much I need
To say to you,
So many reasons why
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now,
Who has just an empty space
And there's nothing left here
To remind me,
Just the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now,
'Cause there's just
An empty space

But to wait for you,
Is all I can do
And that's what
I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now,
'Cause I'll still be
Standing here
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
It's the chance
I've gotta take

Take a look at me now
