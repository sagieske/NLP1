Song:

Remember when I sang that song to you
And you called it out of tune
Remember when I said I loved you
And you said it wasn't true
Remember we used to talk for hours
Staying up all through the night
Remember when I bought you flowers
And you left them out to die

(But now that's over)

I gave you everything you ever wanted
You gave me nothing but grief
Now that I'm gone you'll see I'm your missing piece
Well, good luck, finding another me
Finding another me

Remember how I used to kiss you
You can kiss that all goodbye
Remember how I used to miss you
Now you don't even cross my mind
And I can't remember why I ever
Let you walk all over me
I won't take your s**t forever
Now it's time for me to leave

I gave you everything you ever wanted
You gave me nothing but grief
Now that I'm gone you'll see I'm your missing piece
Well, good luck, finding another me
Finding another me

When you cry yourself to sleep tonight
You will wish that I was by your side
Yes you will

I gave you everything you ever wanted
You gave me nothing but grief
Now that I'm gone you'll see I'm your missing piece
Well, good luck, finding another me, yeah
Finding another me, oooh

Now don't you that karma tastes so sweet
So, good luck, finding another me
