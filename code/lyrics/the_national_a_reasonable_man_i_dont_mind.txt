Song:

I don't mind losing a girl to herself
A quiet love is better than none
And I don't mind losing a friend to a friend
If only to be a reasonable man

And I don't mind waiting if it's for the best
A careful heart is better than none
I don't mind painting my back with the past
Pictures in resolute pain
Smoothing the laugh o'er the lane

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door
If only to be a resolute man (Pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door
If only to be a resolute man (Pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man

If only to be a reasonable man
If only to be a reasonable man
