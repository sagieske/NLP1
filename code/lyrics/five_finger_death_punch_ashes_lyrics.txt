Song:

[V1:]
You don't understand me,
And you probably never will
I got a tendency to self destruct,
And a soft spot for the filth
A hair trigger temperament,
A switchblade for a tongue
I'm a walking one-man genocide
With a black belt in corrupt

[Chorus:]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

Love me, hate me
Isolate me everyday that I'm alive
Straight up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

[V2:]
I'm a jinx, a curse, some say, "the worst"
I'm a savage, rabid beast
I've been called so many f*****g things,
It doesn't affect me in the least
I've stolen, lied, been crucified but I don't regret a thing
I'm an egocentric masochist with a sadist's point of bleak

[Chorus:]
Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands

Love me, hate me
Isolate me everyday that I'm alive
Straight up mentally unstable
You don't have to like my life

Everything I touch turns to ashes
Falls away, it falls away
Everything I touch turns to ashes
It slips right through my hands
