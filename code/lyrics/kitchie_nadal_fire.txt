Song:

Little child, did you throw the dice again?
Black and blue paint on your wall.
Didn't mama tell you that she loves you so?
Even if her bones are dry to hear you sing and cry.
Attempting to please the world at the age of seventeen.
You kill your babies and call it offering
The stench of truth: a life for a life, to be kind is to be unkind.
It took six sweet years of your life.
You walked alone along with your tea-cold-colored mind.
Subtly you pay the curse upon you,
But a promise of the man seeps through earth, grave and stone.
You will seek Him with all your heart, soul and strength.
Youll count all the cost as you walk out the door.
Without a warning you'll set the world on fire! Like it used to be
Fire!(repeat)
Youre never appearing not to.
Emerging through unscathed.
Little god, you're cauterized by sin.
Comfortable and seem to gain the taste of a fatherless
It took six sweet years of your life.
You walked alone along with your tea-cold-colored mind.
Subtly you pay the curse upon you,
But a promise of the man seeps through earth, grave and stone.
You will seek Him with all your heart, soul and strength.
Youll count all the cost as you walk out the door.
Without a warning you'll set the world on fire! Like it used to be
Fire!(repeat)
