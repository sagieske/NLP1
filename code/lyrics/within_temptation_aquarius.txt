Song:

I hear your whispers
Break the silence and it calms me down.
Your taste on my lips,
Your salty kisses.

They say I'm seeking out the danger.
That one day you won't let me go,
I'll drown, you'll take me down.

I need you Aquarius,
Enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
Cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.
You call to me, you set me free.

I relinquish to your powers.
From your grasp, I just can't hide.
I missed the danger I had to conquer.
You made me feel alive.

They say I have to be aware,
That one day you won't let me go,
I'll drown you, you'll take me down.

I need you Aquarius,
Enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
Cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.

I long for you Aquarius.
I need to be with you again.
I fear you, Aquarius
My desinty until the end of time.

I need you Aquarius,
Enchanted I will have to stay.
I feel you Aquarius,
Cause you the sea set me free.
You call to me Aquarius.
