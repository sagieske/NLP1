Song:

All of my life
There were things I wanted to do
But they all changed
The moment I set my eyes on you
The magnetism that attracted me to you
There's something inside I just can't explain
And now I know
What I must do

Hey look at the sun
It's finally shining on my life
It's shining on my life
And it's all because of you
It's finally shining on my life
For me and for you

All of my life
I've wandered 'round time and again
But I never thought
That all my searching would
Come to an end
And then you came along
And my world of love began
So now i'm gonna
Change my ways
You're all I want
You're all I need

Hey look at the sun
It's finally shining on my life
It's shining on my life
And it's all because of you
It's finally shining on my life
For me and for you

Hey look at the sun
It's finally shining on my life
Hey look at the sun
It's finally shining on my life
