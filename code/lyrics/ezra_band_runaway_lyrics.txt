Say It's true
There's nothing like me and you
Not alone Tell me you feel it too
Cuz' I have runaway
I will runaway, yeah.
Yeah... I will runaway, runaway.
I will runaway... With you.

Cause I... Have fallen in love.
With you.
No never have I'm...
Never gonna stop, falling in love.
With you.

Close the door,
Lay down upon the floor
And by candlelight
Make love to me,
Through the night.

Cause I have runaway.
I have runaway, yeah
Yeah...
I have runaway, runaway
I have runaway
With you.
Cause I...
Fallen in love
With you.
No never have I never gonna stop,
Falling in love
With you.

Cause I'm
Falling in love
With you.
No never have I'm
Never gonna stop,
Falling in love
Stop, falling in love.
With you...
