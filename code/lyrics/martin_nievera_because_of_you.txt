Song:

(Verse 1)
If ever you wondered if you touched my soul yes you do
Since I met you I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do
Just the way you say hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never thought I'd fall in love with you...

(Chorus)
Because of you, my life has changed,
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame,
I'll tell the world it's because of you

(Verse 2)
Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you
You captured something inside of me
You make all of my dreams come true
It's not enough that you love me for me
You reached inside and touched me eternally
I love you best explains how I feel for you...

(Chorus)
Because of you, my life has changed,
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame,
I'll tell the world it's because of you

(Bridge)
The magic in your eyes
True love I can't deny
When you hold me I just lose control
I want you to know that I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me I want the world to see,
It's because of you

(Chorus)
Because of you, my life has changed,
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame,
I'll tell the world
It's because of you My life has changed
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you
