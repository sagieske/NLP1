Song:

(Roger Miller - Faron Young)
I know how it feels to be alive with no desire to live
I know how it feels to never take and always have to give
And the day I found out was on the day you let me down
In this world so full of love with not enough to go around.
--- Instrumental ---
I was once so proud to have your love that I could burst with pride
But you took that away and now I'm breaking up inside
It's enough to make me wish that I could hide and not be found
In this world so full of love with not enough to go around.
--- Instrumental ---
For days and nights I wonder and the reason I can't find
There's so much love around me and no love to call mine
It's enough to make me wish that I could hide and not be found
In this world so full of love yet not enough to go around...
