Song:

A last time for everything
My head is burning inside
Once again they've found me
Their swirling voices fill my ears
Leave this all behind you
Screaming their way into my mind
Leaving everything you know behind
I'm in fast-forward and you are in rewind
The song plays when life and death align
The shaking seems so still
When you're shaking as well
In time we all crossoveralive inside our death
Fear escapes alongside of my breath
A last time for everything
Time stops for one
But not for another
Sever the great strings of the earth
