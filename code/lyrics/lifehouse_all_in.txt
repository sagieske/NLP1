Song:

All night, staring at the ceiling
Counting the minutes I'm feeling this way
So far away and so alone

But you know it's alright,
I came to my senses
Letting go of my defenses
There's no way I'm giving up this time,
Yea, you know I'm right here
I'm not losing you this time

And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I'm falling harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game, I'm all in
I'm all in tonight, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in for life

There's no taking back what we've got
It's too strong, we've had each other's back for too long
There's no breaking up this time
And you know it's okay, I came to my senses
Let go of my defenses
There's no way I'm giving up this time

And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I'm falling harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game, I'm all in,
I'm all in tonight, yea I'm all in, I'm all in for life

I want it, I want it, I want it,
I want it, I want it, I want it, yeah
I want it, I want it, I want it,

And I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game, I'm all in, I'm all in for life
And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I'm falling harder than a landslide
I spend a week away from you last night
And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game, I'm all in
I'm all in tonight, yeah I'm all in, I'm all in for life
Yea I'm all in, I'm all in for life
