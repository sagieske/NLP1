Song:

Elaine:
There is more to this time of year
Than sleigh bells and holly

Michael:
Mistletoe and snow

Both:
Those things will come and go

Elaine:
Don't look inside a stocking
Don't look under the tree
For one thing we'll looking for
Is something we can't see

Michael:
For more precious than silver
And more splendid than gold
This is something to treasure
But it's something we can't hold

Both:
As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe

Michael:
That hope is the greatest
Of the gives we'll receive
We'll receive

As we all prays together
Is it's time to rejoice

Elaine:
And though we may look different

Both
We'll all sing with one voice

Oohhhhh

As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe

That hope is the greatest of the gifts we'll receive
As long as there's Christmas
We'll all be just fine
A star shines above us
Lighting your way and mine

As long as there's Christmas
I truly believe
That hope is the greatest
Of the gifts we'll receive
As long as a guiding star
Shines above
There'll always be Christmas
There'll always be a time
When the world is filled with peace and love
