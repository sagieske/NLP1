Song:

Baptised in fire.
Forty to one

So silent before the storm
Awaiting command
A few has been chosen to stand
As one outnumbered by far
The orders from high command
Fight back, hold your ground!

In early September it came
A war unknown to the world
No warning they entered that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

The 8th of September it starts
The rage of the Reich
A barrage of mortars and guns
Stand past, the bunkers will hold
The captain has pledged his life
I'll face my fate here!
The sound of artillery strike
So fierce
The thunder of guns

So come, bring on all that you've got
Come hell, come high water, never stop
Unless you are forty to one
Your lives will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
40 to 1
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, buried in history

No vermin may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory!
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacth brought to a halt

No, no, no
