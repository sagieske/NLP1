Song:

Animal, you're an animal
Don't take anything less
Out of control, you're out of control
Strike those in distress

Analyze, Advertise, Expand
Add more rules,
And buy yourself and island

Animals, we're animals
Buy when blood is on the street
Out of control, we're out of control
Crush those who beg at your feet

Analyze, Franchise, Spread out
Kill the competition
And buy yourself an ocean

Advertise, Downsize, and layoff
Kill yourself
Come on and do us all a favor
