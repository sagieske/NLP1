Song:

Yeah, what's up? It's that time in the big city
98 hot degrees out there
Check it out there's a party goin' on all day at the beach
So fellas you might want to wash the Chevy's
Drop the tops, and ladies y'all pull out the bathing suits
'Cause it's gonna be a scorcha

Yeah baby, come on it's time to have some fun
It's summer time so let's unwind and go out in the sun
I like when all the young ladies be off on the beach
Tryin' to creep 4-deep in them convertible Jeep

Lookin' oh so s***, wearin' them daisy dunes
They lookin' so cute in them 2-piece bathing suits
Baby illin', chillin', stylin', profilin', down by the ocean
(Ocean ocean)
All the fellas be sweatin', goin' out of they minds
'Cause them girls be so fine down south in the summer time

Halter tops and daisy dunes, s*** 2-piece bathing suits
Hair and nails is up to par, lookin' like a superstar
Lot of clouds up in the sky and all them ladies lookin' fine
Big, tall, short, and fine
Oh yeah, it must be summer time

Come on and break out your daisy dunes
Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun
Stomp your feet and clap your hands, and wild out to the Summer Jam

It's summer time, time to move baby, it's time to dip baby
But we can't, traffic's jammed on the strip by them playas
With them vogues on the Cadillacs
Bending curves in suburbs with the boom in the back

Matter fact, all them ladies be crowdin' around
Them playas with the Benz's when they let the top down
Cruisin' slow and low, one time for the 64
Baby pumpin' up the sound and bouncin' up and down
Everybody chillin' not a worry on they mind
Pumpin' the Summer Jam because it's summer time
(Time time)

Heavy Chevys Cadillac with them boom in the back
Ucd in the deck, boy be gettin' much respect
Cruisin' up and down the block, go ahead and drop the top
Wild on out and unwind 'cause it's summer time

Come on and break out your daisy dunes
Along with your bathing suits
Versace shades to block the sun, it's time to go have some fun
Stomp your feet and clap your hands, and wild out to the Summer Jam
