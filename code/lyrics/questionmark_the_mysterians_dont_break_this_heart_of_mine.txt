Song:

Don't break this heart of mine
Just a-leave me alone
Don't tell me all those lies that I done heard before
Don't come around anymore just a-leave me alone
I got one heart and baby I can't take no more, yeah

Alright, look here, yeah

You came around when I was sad and blue
Thought you had love that was so true
I put you down and you put my aside
But still I wonder baby if your'e mine all mine

Don't break this heart of mine
Just a-leave me alone
Don't tell me all those lies that I done heard before
Don't come around anymore just a-leave me alone
I got one heart and baby I can't take no more, yeah

Look here, yeah, baby yeah don't
Don't take this heart, c'mon
Don't take this heart
Please don't take this heart of mine
Leave me alone
Don't take this heart of mine
Leave me alone
