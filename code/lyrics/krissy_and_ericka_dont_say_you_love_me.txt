Song:

You got introduced to you by a friend
You were cute and all that's baby, you set the trend; yes, you did
The next thing you know were down at the cinema
Sitting there, you said you loved me what's that about
You're moving too fast I don't understand you
I'm not ready yet baby, I can't pretend no, I can't
The best I can do is tell you to talk to me
It's possible, eventual love will find a way

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me then give some time 
Don't call me baby not before I"m ready don't say your heart in hurry
Not like we're gonna get married
Give me, Give me some time 
Ohhh, Ohhh

Here's how I play here's where you stand
Here's what to do to get any further than where it's been
I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice
You better take it slow keep pushin' me, keep pushin' me away

Don't say you love me
You don't even know me
If you really want me then give some time 
Don't call me baby not before I"m ready don't say your heart in hurry
Not like we're gonna get married
Give me, Give me some time 

Ooh, na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
Ooh, na na na na na na na, na na na na na
Don't say you love me
You don't even know me, baby, hey hey

[Repeat CHORUS underneath]

Baby, don't say you love me, baby
Give me some time
Don't say your heart's in a hurry
Not like we're gonna get married
Give me, give me some time
