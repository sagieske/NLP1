Song:

Tell me, how you've been, 
Well it's so good to me to see you again, 

Lady, you're so fine, 
I wish there was a way I could share your time, 

(Glenn)
I need someone in my life cause I'm lonely, for your lovin', 
You make me feel so alive, you're the woman and nobody else will do, That's why I'm... 

Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, 

Why don't you love me?, don't be shy, 
Like the wings of an eagle, let your feelings fly, 

Precious, Shining Star, 
Do I need me a rocket to be where you are?

(Glenn)
I need someone in my life cause I'm lonely, for your lovin', 
You make me feel so alive, you're the woman and nobody else will do, That's why I'm... 

Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming at your heart, 

I'm Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, 

I'm Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, 

I'm Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, Aiming, 
Aiming at your heart, (end)
