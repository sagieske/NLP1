Song:

Now, when you see two women
Runnin' hand in hand
And neither one a-worried
About the other one's man

They got a good understandin'
Yes, a good understandin'
You know a good understandin
Can make ev'rything alright

Now, when you see two dogs
Nawin' on the same bone
It ain't no growlin'
An a-fightin' goin' on

They got a good understandin'
Yes, they got a good understandin'
You know a good understandin
Can make ev'rything alright

(sax & instrumental)

Now, when the lamb and the lion
Can lay side by side
An rover lick the tom cat
In his eye

They got a good understandin'
Yes, they got a good understandin'
You know a good understandin
Can make ev'rything alright

Yes, a good understandin
Can-a make ev'rything alright.
