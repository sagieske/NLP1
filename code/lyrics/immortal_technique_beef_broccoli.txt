Song:

Look, let me make something
Abundantly clear for people
Who are sober after activities
They feel like they gotta comment on mine.
First of all being a vegetarian should
Never be associated with being
A revolutionary or being open-minded.
That's a dietary choice.
If someone wants to proliferate the
Type of ignorance we're supposed to
Be fighting by thinking that,
You're just f*****g yourself.
I don't go around promoting
Beef and pultry shoving it in
People's faces.
I don't castigate people for not
Eating steak sandwiches;
And I would never diss someone
For being a f*****g broccoli-head,
Or living off of radishes,
Or eating grass or tofu.
I like a lot of vegan cuisine.
But the illogicality of expecting
Everyone to adopt their particular
Idea of what being healthy is
Is just preposterous.
I've seen some of you herbivores;
And if you want to argue health,
Y'all need to eat some kind of supplement
Because some of y'all are so skinny
That it's disgusting; looking like the
Only hip-hop motherfuckers on schindler's list.
Being a malnutrition-a** got nothing to do
With being revolutionary or being on-point.
I'll be damned if I let somebody else push
Their agenda on me. You know I don't eat pork,
Not because I'm a muslim, I just don't
Really like it, but I really will
F**k a bird up. And fish is good
When that s**t is fresh. It's like my n***a
Vast Aire from Can Ox said. If you don't like
The smell of burning meat, well then get
The f**k off the planet. You know I don't
Criticize people for eating moss,
Then don't open your f*****g mouth
About my food, man. I like beef
And broccoli m**********are. Mind
Your god-damn business. Matter of fact...
You know what? I'm out. I feel like some
Arroco pollo, a banana daiquiri, and
A motherfucking bistec aponado.
