Song:

Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance
Just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

High on words we almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same achilles heels

Make them dance
Just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

Open up your skies (Turn up your night)
To the speed of light (Turn up your night)
Put your love in lights (Turn up your night)
I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go
Yeah you always make me go

I'll run away with your footsteps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself
I will find you

Yeah you always make me go

Turn up your night
Turn up your night
Turn it up, turn it up

I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make me go
