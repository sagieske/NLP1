Song:

We're Flying High On A Velvet Sky, 
With The Wind On Our Wings
Climbing Easily On The Breeze

We're Flying Easy And We Do Just What We Please
We Drink The Breezes As We Drink Wine, And The Nectar Is Sweet
Now The Feeling We Have Is Fun
We're Flying Easy Drifting On A Summer Breeze

The Trip Is Smooth And We Gently Glide
We Ride The Rainbow And We See To A Tee
How Happy We Can Be

We Gather Gold From The Evening Sun
And It's Heavenly Hues
And We Don't Have A Thing To Lose
Were Flying Easy And We Do Just What We Choose

The Trip Is Smooth And We Gently Glide
We Ride The Rainbow And We See To A Tee
How Happy It Can Be To Be Free

We Float And There Is No Thought Of Time
Cause Were Singing Of Love
And The Pleasure Is So Devine

Were Flying Easy Not A Worry On Our Mind
Were Flying Easy Not A Worry On Our Mind
Were Flying Easy On A Breeze
Flying, Flying Flying
