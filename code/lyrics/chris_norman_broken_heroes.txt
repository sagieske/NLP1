Song:

Love is like a looser's game

I'll never play again

I'm through with love forever.
Oh
I'm like a fallen star

Love can leave a scar

It's raining in my heart
Babe.
Yes
It's true
I'm still missing you.

Broken heroes and fallen angels

Broken dreams and hearts ot stone

There's no smoke
Girl
Without a fire

And I'm standing here alone
All alone.

How much have I sacrificed?
My heart aches deep inside
In the name of love
Girl.
And how much time and loneliness
I traded for a kiss

It's raining in my heart
Babe.
Yes
It' s true
I'm still missing you.

Broken heroes and fallen angels
...
Broken heroes and fallen angels
...
