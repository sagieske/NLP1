Song:

Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
I'm sick to death of swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
You think you're changing anything?
Question everything

The world's a s**t tip your children are f****d.
The ones you think got you are out for your blood.
Well, our minds are battered and washed out with static
So what exactly do you think you're going to do?

United we'll fail.
Divided we'll fall.
We're f****d, but you're making it worse.
United we'll fail.
Divided we'll fall.
Give up, 'cause you're making it so much worse.

Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
I'm sick to death of swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
You think you're changing anything?
Question everything

Give me a break, you deluded ill-informed
Self-serving prick.
If you really believe in the words that you preach
Get off your screens and onto the street.

There will be no peaceful revolution,
No war without blood.
You can say I'm just a fool that stands for nothing...
Well to that, I say you're a c***.

Kick it!

United we'll fail (united we'll fail).
Divided, we'll fall (divided, we'll fall).
United, we'll fail.
We're f****d, but you're making it worse.

Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
I'm sick to death of swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
You think you're changing anything?
Question everything
Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
I'm sick to death of swallowing
Every single thing I've said.
Middle fingers up if you don't give a f**k.
You think you're changing anything?
Question everything
