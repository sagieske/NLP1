Song:

Now the sentenced has been passed, death will soon be here
The time has come for him to die, his face tormented fear
Pilate washed his hands of him, nothing can be done
To stop the anti-Christians having their evil fun

Marching on to Calgary, the cross digs in his back
He knows that there is no return, he cannot resist attack
Blood is pouring from the wounds where the whip has bitten
His eyes show the pain he's in, the people by death smitten

You will die on the cross
When the time is right
You will die on the cross
Hang by day and by night

Waiting on the route of death, the baying, chanting crowd
Spit on him as he walks by and defilate the shroud
On ahead at Calgary the thorns and nails await
To be forced in through his wrists, driven in by hate

You will die on the cross
When the time is right
You will die on the cross
Hang by day and by night

Die Christ, in pain, nailed to wood
From skulls of apostles we drink his blood

A thorn crown is forced on his head
A spear enters his lung - he is dead

Hanging still on the cross, blood falls to the earth
His father sent him down to save, has it been his worth?
A lonely figure on the hill, nailed onto a pole
Will the Holy Ghost descend to take his blackened soul?

You will die on the cross
When the time is right
You will die on the cross
Hang by day and by night
Die on the cross, die on the cross, die on the cross

You will die on the cross
