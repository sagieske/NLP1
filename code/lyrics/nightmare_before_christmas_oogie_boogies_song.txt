Song:

Oogie Boogie:

Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

you're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy.
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse.
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first.

When Mr. Oogie boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the boogie Man.
And if you aren't shakin'
then there's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time you hear the boogie song, ohhh.

Three Bats: Ohhh

Oogie Boogie: Ohhh

Seven Lizards: Ohhh

Oogie Boogie: Ohhh

Seven Lizards: Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

Oogie Boogie:
Well if I'm feelin' ansty
And there's nothin' much to do
I might just cook a special batch
Of snake and spider stew.
And don't ya know one thing
That would make it so nice?
A roly-poly Sandy Claws to add a little spice.

Three Skeletons: Ohhh

Oogie Boogie: Oh yeah

Three Bats: Ohhh

Oogie Boogie: Ohhh

Three Bats: Ohhh

Oogie Boogie and Three Skeletons: Oh yeah, I'm (he's) the Boogie Man

Santa:
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

Oogie Boogie:
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up?
I'm drownin' in my tears.
It's funny, I'm laughing
you really are too much
And now, with your permission,
I'm going to do my stuff

Santa: What are you going to do?

Oogie Boogie: I'm going to do the best I can

(Musical Interlude)

Oh the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair.

It's much more fun, I must confess
When lives are on the line
Not mine, of coursebut yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine.

Santa: Release me fast or you'll have to answer for this heinous act

Oogie Boogie:
Oh brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
the position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got prayer
'Cause I;m Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't goin' nowhere
