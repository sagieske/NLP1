Song:

Know I love you baby
Know I love you baby
You know I love you baby
You don't even know my name

Let me tell you baby
I tell you what I would do
I would rather be a big somebody
And come home to you

Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
You don't even know my name

Let me tell you baby
Though it don't sound true
If you'd throw me in the ocean
I'd swim to the shore

And come home to you
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby

You don't even know my name, alright
Know I love you baby
Know I love you baby
You know I love you baby

You don't even know my name
Let me tell you baby
I tell you what I would do
I would rather be a big somebody

And come home to you
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby

You don't even know my name, alright
Four o'clock in the mornin'
You come walkin' home
I ain't got no consolation

But to ring you on the phone
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby
Ain't that lovin' you baby

You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name
You don't even know my name
