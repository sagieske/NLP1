Lyrics/Music S. Mitchell/L. Pollack
Next Friday night your all invited
To dance from 8 to 5
All the fishes still alive
Are having a ball
Its some affair they'll all be there
From the Herring to the Whale
They'll turn out to shake a scale
In Neptune's Hall
Come along and follow me
To the bottom of the sea
We'll join in the Jamboree
At the Codfish ball
Lobsters dancing in a row
Shuffle off to Buffalo
Jelly fish sway to and fro
At the Codfish ball
Finn-an-haddie leads the eel
Thought an Irish reel
The Catfish is a dancing man
But he can't can-can like a sardine can
Tunas trucking left and right
Minnies mooching what a night
There won't be a hook in site
At the Codfish ball
