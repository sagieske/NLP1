Song:

Chorus:
I hear a voice callin'
It must be our Lord (it must be our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high.
I hear a voice callin'
I've gained a reward (I've gained a reward)
For the land where we never shall die.

The saviour who died, on cruel calvary
He she'd his life blood that the world might be free.
So follow his footsteps, up the narrow way.
And be ready to meet him when calls on that day.

Repeat chorus:

The saviour has paid a great price for me
He gave his life on calvary.
So follow his footsteps, up the narrow way.
That'll pay my debt on the great judgement day.

Repeat chorus
