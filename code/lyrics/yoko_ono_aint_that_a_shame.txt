Song:

You made me cry when you said goodbye.
Aint that a shame?
My tears fell like rain.
Aint that a shame?
Youre the one to blame.

You broke my heart when you said were part.
Aint that a shame?
My tears fell like rain.
Aint that a shame?
Youre the one to blame.

Boogie, babe!

Aint that a shame?
Aint that a shame?
Look out!

Farewell, goodbye, although Ill cry.
Aint that a shame?
My tears fell like rain.
Aint that a shame?
Youre the one to blame.

Boggie, babe!

Aint that a shame?
Aint that a shame?

You made me cry when you said goodbye.
Aint that a shame?
My tears fell like rain.
Aint that a shame?
Youre the one to blame.
