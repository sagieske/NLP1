Song:

We've been lovers
For a very long time
Been friends much longer than that
But due to circumstances beyond our control
We had to hide the very thing we know is fact

Now the rumor has it, we're messin' around
People seein' us together all the time
Things you say to your friends 'bout me
Things I say 'bout you
It becomes obvious and such a clear sign

So baby
Why don't we just stop playin' the masquerade?
And let it fade

1 - Everybody knows that I love you baby
And they know that you love me too
Why don't we stop foolin' around?

They all think that both of us is actin' kinda crazy
Tryin' hard to hide what's true
Why don't we stop foolin' around?

Baby girl, I love you
Like the rays of the sun
And it's written all over my face
(Written all over my face)
Wanna be with you always
'Til my days are done
'Cause no one could ever take your place

And baby, I know, I know
That you feel the same
So no more games

Repeat 1

O baby
Why don't we just stop playin' the masquerade?
And let it fade

Repeat 1 to fade
