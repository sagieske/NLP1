Song:

I've been walking through my life like
There's nothing to lose
Running when the light turns red
Lately I realize there's a hole in my shoe
Does it match with the hole in my head

The sun goes down
Ain't it funny how your face keeps coming back around
Where are you now
Now that I have opened up my eyes

Stop, stop the world I wanna get off
It's too late burning in my mind
Stop, stop killing me with what I haven't got
It's too late burning in my mind

What was I thinking at the end of my rope
Let my attitude get ahead of my heart
Some people get it and some of us don't
As I love alone in the dark

What's kept inside
All comes out in the wash after a while
Where are you now
Now that I have had my big surprise

Stop, stop the world I wanna get off
It's too late burning in my mind
Stop, stop killing me with what I haven't got
It's too late I'm losing my space in time

There was truth in it all your Sunday sermons
You were right about the one who's hurting now
It's burning in mind

Tired of being free
It gets harder every day
Cause in my mind you'll always be
The one that got away
