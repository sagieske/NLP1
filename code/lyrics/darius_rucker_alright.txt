Song:

Alright, alright
Yeah, it's alright, alright

And I don't need five star reservations
I got spaghetti and a cheap bottle of wine
I don't need no concert in the city
I got a stereo and the 'Best Of Patsy Cline'

Ain't got no caviar, no Dom Perignon
But as far as I can see I got everything I want

'Cause I got a roof over my head
The woman I love layin' in my bed
And it's alright, alright

I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the aisle staring back at me
And it's alright, alright

Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you

May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby I think I got it made

'Cause I got a roof over my head
The woman I love layin' in my bed
And it's alright, alright

I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the aisle staring back at me
And it's alright, alright

Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me
It's alright by me, yeah, yeah

When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

'Cause I got a roof over my head
The woman I love layin' in my bed
And it's alright, alright, alright, alright

I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the aisle staring back at me
And it's alright, alright, alright

Yeah, I got all I need, yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me, oh yeah
It's alright by me, yeah, yeah, yeah
