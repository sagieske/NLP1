Song:

Gentleman style
Soft and white, like virgin snow
She's calmly watching my desire grow
The moon is full, wearing a dirty smile.
And I cover her body gentleman style.
Her fragile cobweb surrounds my heart
There's no escaping 'till death do us part
My blood is calling, I wait a while
And I grant all her wishes gentleman style
She's poison and angel
She's fire and rain
Here I go, I'm falling again
Watch my heart come to life in the light of her smile
While it's silently breaking gentleman style
Temptations wearing a crimson dress
She talks of heaven in her sweet carress
My heart won't make it another mile
And I touch her in places gentleman-style
She's poison and angel
She's fire and rain
Here I go, I'm falling again
Watch my heart come to life in the light of her smile
While it's silently breaking gentleman style
Cold blue sweat on desert soil
Love is watching a good thing spoil
Emotions in bondage, it ain't worthwhile
And I walk out of her life, gentleman-style
She's poison and angel
She's fire and rain
Here I go, I'm falling again
Watch my heart come to life in the light of her smile
While it's silently breaking gentleman style
Gentleman style.....
