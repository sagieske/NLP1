Song:

Until now, I knew this of myself
That if you had thrown yourself down
Into the lions den
My brother I'd follow you in

Perhaps I lacked some foresight (should have known)
But brother you were so right
Sure as the setting sun
You can't trust just anyone

That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
That's what you're asking but you're gonna get more than you bargained for
That's what you had but you don't have it anymore
You had it coming

I never imagined you dead,
But tell me, are you even aware
That all that we did
You undo, Iscariot, you fool

That's what you want, but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking but you're gonna get more than you
Bargained for
I said that's what you had but you don't have it anymore
You had it coming

Ohhh that's what you want but it's not what you're asking for
I said that's what you're asking but you're gonna get more than you
Bargained for
I said that's what you had but you don't have it anymore
You had it coming

Oh you know had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
My brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
My brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
My brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You had it coming

Ohhh my brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
My brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
Brother my brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You know you had it coming my brother,
My brother had it coming my friend, my friend
You had it coming
