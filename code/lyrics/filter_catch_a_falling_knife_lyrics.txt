Song:

Life was just a school yard.
Life was just a play ground.
Life was just a sweet suburban memory.

It got changed when I first met you.
It got changed and I just let you.
I just had to keep the peace inside of me.

I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.
I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.

Catch a falling knife with a razor's edge.
To catch a falling life, that's better off dead.

Mom and Dad, what happened?
I looked back and you were missing.
It's been like that for such a long, and lonely time.

Life was just a school yard.
Life was just a play ground.
Life was just a sweet suburban memory.

I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.
I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.

Catch a falling knife with a razor's edge.
To catch a falling life, that's better off dead.

Change the world in me.
You didn't let me see.
Hearts grow black and cold.
It was young and now it's old.
Old! 

Catch a falling knife with a razor's edge.
To catch a falling life, that's better off dead.

Catch a falling knife with a razor's edge.
To catch a falling life, that's better off dead.

I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.
I have spent my life in here; in your home, but my hell.

Catch a falling knife with a razor's edge.
To catch a falling life, that's better off dead...
