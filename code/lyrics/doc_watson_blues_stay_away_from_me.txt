Song:

Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why
A You keep on hounting me

Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow
We never can agree

(break)

Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on hounting me

Life is full of misery
Tears so many I can't see
Seems somehow
I never can be free

Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on hounting me
