Song:

When my song touch lifes everyday
I love to see you dance the night away
Because of my love for you
My sun keeps rising

When things go changing
Searching to find a way
We get together wipe away the tears they bring
No more crying
Now I'm flying
You will never be alone

When my song touch lifes everyday
I love to see you dance the night away
Because of my love for you
My sun keeps rising

When things go changing
Searching to find a way
We get together wipe away the tears they bring
No more crying
Now I'm flying
You will never be alone

Every... 
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Every... 
Clap your hands clap your hands
Clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Every... 
Clap your hands clap your hands
Clap your hands clap your hands

So many roads lay ahead of me
Which way I go is always scaring me
But is making me stronger
Hmmmm, believe in me
So much joy you give me everyday
When I see you dancing the stress away

I can feel it I can touch it
When I give it back to you

Alright... 

Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody dance, clap your hands clap your hands
Everybody...
