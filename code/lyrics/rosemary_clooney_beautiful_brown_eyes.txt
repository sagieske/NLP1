Chorus:

Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes,
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes,
Beautiful, beautiful brown eyes,
I'll never love blue eyes again

Willie, oh Willie, I love youj
Love you with all my heart;
Tomorrow we might have been married,
But ramblin has kept us apart. "

Chorus:.

Down to the barroom he staggered,
And fell down by the door;
The lvery last words that he uttered,
I'll never see brown eyes no more)
