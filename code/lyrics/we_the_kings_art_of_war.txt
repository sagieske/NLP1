Song:

I was just a kid than stripping stones
Innocent and so alone
And I sense we were all alone
You could take my heart and you could take my home
But you will never ever break my soul
No you'll never ever break my soul

But you know me
I wanna go back but I can't back down
And you know me too well
Cause

I'm a soldier, till it's over
You and I fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, up against the war yeah
I'm a soldier, till it's over
Live and die fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall

We were just two kids thrown into the flame
We would never ever be the same
We would never ever be the same
We were just a spark that lit the change
They could never ever bring the rain
They could never ever bring the rain

But you know me
I wanna go back but I can't back down and
You know me too well
Cause

I'm a soldier, till it's over
You and I fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, up against the war yeah
I'm a soldier, till it's over
Live and die fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall

Follow me into the dark and I will lead you to the light
Flawless, soundless, fearless, hearts keep holding on all through the night

I'm a soldier, till it's over
You and I fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, up against the war yeah
I'm a soldier, till it's over
Live and die fighting for the art of war
I'm a soldier, I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall
I will never fall

Follow me into the dark and I will lead you to the light
Flawless, soundless, fearless, hearts keep holding on all through the night
