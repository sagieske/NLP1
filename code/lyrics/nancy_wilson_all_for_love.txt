Song:

Oooh
Looking at you tonight
Breathless at what I see
In your eyes there's someone
Come to carry me

Some never have a chance
Some throw their chance away
Now it's in my hands
I face it unafraid

If we ever did one thing that was right...

We gave it all for love
Saved it all for love
Didn't we touch the fire above
And make music out of madness?
We gave it all for love

(Whoa-oa-oa)

Everything still to come
One thing will stay the same
We will heal each other
And never turn away

To my lonely heart you are my home...

We gave it all for love
Saved it all for love
Didn't we touch the fire above
And make music out of madness?
We gave it all for love

To my lonely heart you are my home...

(Oooh, to love someone)
(Oooh, to love someone)
Did we touch the fire above (To love someone)
It will carry us forever

Didn't we feel the fire for love (To love someone)
Tear down the walls for love (To love someone)
Didn't we do it all for love (To love someone)
And make music out of madness?
We gave it all, we gave it all for love

Show me the way to your heart (Whoa-oa-oa)
Show me the way to your heart
Show me the way, yeah
(Whoa-oa-oa)
