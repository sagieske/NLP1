Song:

When they begin, begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more, I'm with you under the stars, under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying, oh swaying
When they begin, when they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor, past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart, clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Til clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that we wasted
I know but too well, I know too well, what they mean, too well what they mean

So let them begin, begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more: "Darling, I love you!"
And we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin, begin the beguine
Begin begin begin begin begin begin
Begin the beguine
