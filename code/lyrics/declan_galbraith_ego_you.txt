Song:

Oh a oh oh oh a oh oh
In pain you speak
All that you need
When you'd decide
When all is said and done
You'd laugh it off and run

In time you'll see
What you kept from me
I should have known
We could have made it through
But that's just ego you

Time will show and time will tell
What you need to make it well
Time will show I know
If I let you go

Oh a oh oh oh a oh oh
Through all you life
All filled with strife
All you desire
Has been torn up in two
Because of ego you

Time will show and time will tell
What you need to make it well
Time will show I know
If I let you go oo oo oo
Go oo oo oo

Time will show and time will tell
What you need to make it well
Time will show I know
If I let you go
