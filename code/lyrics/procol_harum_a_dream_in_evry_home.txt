Song:

Remember when you felt it first?
The bitter taste of love
The hand that reached inside your purse
The fist inside the glove
Remember how it felt to be
The only one who cared
You peeked behind the open door
The bride is always bared

You always knew this day would come
You lie in bed alone
The tv flickers silently
A dream in every home (early mixes exist in which gary sings 'a dream without a home')

Remember when you felt it first?
When you played kiss and tell
The moment that the arrow pierced
The pearl inside the shell
Remember how good it felt to be?
To really come alive
You peeked behind the open door
The secrets of the hive
