Song:

Verse 1:
I heard the news the other day,
It said you've gone away,
And left me hear behind.
What happened to the time we used to share?
I thought you'd always be there,
I can't get you off my mind.
My heart's in pain,
But no one seems to care.
I called you on the telephone,
Hoping you'd be there.
Chorus:
Broken Hearted,
I'm left with a broken heart,
You tore my whole life apart,
I can't live without you.
Broken hearted,
I'm left with a broken heart,
You tore my whole life apart,
I can't live without you.
Tell me what am I supposed to do?
My whole life has been just you.
Now it seems it's over.
Tell me was I the one to blame,
This is driving me insane,
Now that you got another lover,
I can't believe this is happening to me,
I can't let go,
My love for you,
Now can't you see.
Broken hearted,
I'm left with a broken heart,
You tore my whole life apart,
I can't live without you.
Broken hearted,
I'm left with a broken heart,
You tore my whole life apart,
I can't live without you.
Ohhh,
My heart's in pain,
But no one seems to care,
I called you on the telephone,
Hoping you'd be there.
