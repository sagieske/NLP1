Song:

Color me blind
Color me blind

I had a dream,
Last night I was blind
And I couldn't see
Color of any kind

Picture the world,
Minus a rainbow
When day becomes night,
Then where will the sun go
Dancing alone,
Just me and my shadow
Color me blind,
So I can see no evil

Why do we dream,
In black and white?
Color me blind
Why do we dream
In black and white?
Color me blind

I had a dream,
I was looking, over the mountain
But I've, I've yet to see the,
The so-called promised land

Picture the world,
Without any color
You couldn't tell,
One face from the other
I don't understand
Why we fight with our brother
Color me blind
Just to love one another

Color me, color you,
Color me blind
