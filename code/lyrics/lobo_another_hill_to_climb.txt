Song:

You say you don't like
Where we call home
The way we live
Is bad and wrong
Travellin around instead
Of settling down
Our peace on mind
Is the highway sound

Another hill to climb
Another meal to find
A little air to breathe
That's all we need and we
Will be completely free

You say we don't care
What lies up ahead

There's money to save
Mouths to be fed
We're saving enough
To get away from this town
Lend us ten friend
We'll see you around

We don't see why
You're concerned about us
The way you worry friend
Got hang ups enough
Why not leave it all
And join us on the road
Life is beautiful
Free from the load
