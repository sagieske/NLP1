Song:

Hey baby, be my dog!
Owwww!
Alice in my fantasies, uh
Promised to do all kind of freaky things to me
Said she would, uh, suck my soul, if I'd lick her emotion
The freak said I would even owe her my devotion
She said she'd, uh, cover me with, uh, strawberries
And pretend that I'm a shortcake
I said, "Uh, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin"
Owww!!!
Yeah!!!
Hey!!!
Alice in my fantasies
Promised to do all kind of things to me
Said she would, uhh, suck my soul if I'd lick her emotion
And that I would even owe her my devotion
I saidm "Uh, lady, be my dog and I'll be your tree
And you can pee on me. "
Mama said never eat yellow snow
So away we go!
Huh, huh, huhh, huhh, huhh, huuuuuuhhh, huuuuhhhh!!!! Heyyy!!!
Be my dog!
Hey!
Baby
They call it mental masturbation
