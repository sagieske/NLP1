Song:

Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat the faster
What did I long for? I never really knew
Finding your love, I've found my adventure
Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster
All that I want in all of this world is you

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
