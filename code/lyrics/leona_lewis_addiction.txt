Song:

Without you I'm lost
Without you I'm blind
Without you I'm crossed
And I can't get mind
To think, without you is pain
Without you is sorrow
And I'm going insane
I wish it was tomorrow
Again... 

You're my addiction
When you're not here there's a whole in the place of my heart
Like someone just came
Tore my hear my heart in pieces
Left me in tears
Now my heart is shattered on the ground
This is how I feel
What happens to me
When my drug goes missing
I'm addicted.

When you're missing everything is wrong
When you're missing nothing feels right
When you're missing all I ever long
Is for you the next time
To think that I'm still alive
Is too crazy
It's unbelieveable I survived
Without you.

You're my addictions
When you're gone
All I do is cry
Looking for a shoulder to lean on
Hoping another part of me
That needed you here, won't die
Because that's what happens to my heart
It was left to die
To try to survive on it's own
This is what happens to me
When you go missing, I go crazy.

I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
I'm addicted
You're my addiction

When you're here I am found
I see, I breathe, I can hear all the sound
I feel free
I'm happy no more insanity
Yoday or tomorrow doesn't matter
The whole in my heart is replaced
And my heart is one
When you're here everything is right
No more tears, darkness is light"
I'm alive
I'm in a paradise
Only because of my addiction

Ooohh my addiction... 
I'm addicted.
