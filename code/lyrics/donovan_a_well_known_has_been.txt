Song:

Tonight my life is heavy, I'm weak and down at heel
The prisoner in the dungeon will know just how I feel.
I'm a well known has-been, a well known has-been,
I've got a brand on me.
When I look at my tomorrows, sorrow's all I see,
Sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see.
How sad my disposition, how long can it I bear ?
How deep my melancholy, can anybody care ?
For the well known has-been, the well known has-been,
I've got a brand on me, yeah
When I look at my tomorrows, sorrow's all I see,
Sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see.
Well known has-been
Well known has-been
Well known has-been, ooh, ooh, ooh
I pretend I'm unaffected by the chains that bear me down
And when only those who love me can see behind the frown.
I'm the well known has-been, the well known has-been,
I got a brand on me.
When I look at my tomorrows, sorrow's all I see,
Sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see, sorrow's all I see.
>From these broken days of anguish, some day soon I'm gonna rise,
I'm gonna raise my head to Heaven, I'm gonna fly the starry skies.
And the well known has-been, the well known has-been,
I'll lose the brand on me, yeah.
Today's all I see, today's all I see, today's all I see.
