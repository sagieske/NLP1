Song:

The way your broken heart becomes mine.
We lose part of ourselves over time, and I can't avoid all the lies.
And I can't avoid all the lies.

(As for these words that broke your heart)
I Apologize
(I searched for truth but found no words)
And I can't escape all the lies
(So I become)
I Apologize
(The Riddle)

There's simple reasons for this and I'd like to let it go.
We've got ourselves into this and I still think you should know
That you are the one that made it worth the fall.
You are the one...

(I've waited for so long)
For the chance to breathe before I rip you apart.

(As for these words that broke your heart)
I Apologize
(I searched for truth but found no words)
And I can't escape all the lies
(So I become)
I Apologize
(The Riddle)

Feel the failure. (So do I. And we're dead inside.)

Don't waste this moment bleeding!
(I feel the failure rising deep inside my broken heart.
I'm feeling failed and spited deeply, I've been sold for parts.
So I've become, don't take this personal, my own.
It dies now.)

Smile, I know that I won't fall again, never again.

(As for these words that broke your heart)
I Apologize
(I searched for truth but found no words)
And I can't escape all the lies
(So I become)
I Apologize
(The Riddle)

And I can't escape all the lies
