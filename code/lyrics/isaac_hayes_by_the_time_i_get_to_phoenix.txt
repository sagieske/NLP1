Song:

By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hangin on her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'
Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly and call my name out loud
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Tho time and time I try to tell her so
She just didn't know I would really go
