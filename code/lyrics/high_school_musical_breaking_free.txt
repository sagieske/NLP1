Song:

Troy:
We're soarin', flying
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

Gabriella:
If we're trying
So we're breaking free

Troy:
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are

Gabriella:
Creating space between us
'Till we're separate hearts

Both:
But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe

Chorus #1
Troy:
We're breakin' free

Gabriella:
We're soarin'

Troy:
Flyin'

Both:
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

Troy:
We're trying

Both:
But we're breaking free

Troy:
Oh, we're breakin' free

Gabriella:
Ohhhh

Troy:
Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can't control

Gabriella:
Connected by a feeling
Ohhh, in our very souls

Troy:
Very souls,
Ooooh,

Both:
Rising 'till it lifts us up
So every one can see

Troy:
We're breakin' free

Gabriella:
We're soarin'

Troy: Flyin'

Both:
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

Troy:
If we're trying
But're breaking free

Gabriella:
Ohhhh runnin'

Troy:
Climbin'
To get to that place

Both:
To be all that we can be

Troy:
Now's the time

Both:
So breaking free

Troy:
So breaking free

Gabriella:
Ohhh, yeah

Troy:
More than hope
More than faith

Gabriella:
This is true
This is fate
And together

Both:
We see it comin'

Troy:
More than you
More than me

Gabriella:
Not a want, but a need

Both:
Both of us breakin' free

Gabriella:
Soarin'

Troy:
Flyin'

Both:
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying

Troy:
Yeah we're breaking free

Gabriella:
Breaking free
Were runnin'

Troy:
Ohhhh, climbin'

Both:
To get to the place
To be all that we can be
Now's the time

Troy:
Now's the time

Gabriella:
So we're breaking free

Troy: Ohhh, we're breaking free

Gabriella: Ohhhh

Both:
You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are
