Song:

You can leave me
Take away all that I have
You can want me
Love me for who I am
Choices, romance
Takin' me high in the air
Flyin', so scared
Afraid not to see you again

'Cause I'm scared to death
Now that I'm losin' you
I'm scared to death
Knowin' I can't get through
I'm scared to death
Living this so lonely life without you
Oh baby, I'm scared to death

Somethings changin'
Giving me fears run through my head
Only find me
Give me the eyes I will understand
Words left unsaid
Leaving me weak in the edge
Getting over
I'm running scared
I can't comprehend

'Cause I'm scared to death
Now that I'm losin' you
I'm scared to death
Knowin' I can't get through
I'm scared to death
Living this so lonely life without you
(Yeah-oh) I'm scared to death
Fallin' in love with you
I'm scared to death
There's nothing that I can do
I'm scared to death
What if you won't be around anymore

Slowly
Gently
Choosing me will make me then
You're one and only
I pray that our love will begin

'Cause I'm scared to death
Now that I'm losin' you
I'm scared to death
Knowin' I can't get through
I'm scared to death
Living this so lonely life without you
Ohh, I'm scared to death
Na na na na na na
I'm so scared
Na na na na na na
I'm so scared
What if you won't be, won't be around anymore
I'm scared to death
