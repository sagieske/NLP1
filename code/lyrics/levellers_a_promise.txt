Song:

This place looks familiar, they always are,
Came here again to meet you, forgotten star,
What's that can I hear you talking? What's that you say?
Every cloud has a silver lining, come on mate!

And I love it when you whisper to me...
There's always a promise in the dreams that you think,
There's always a promise in this last drink,
This last drink,

We've met so many places, we've always danced,
Then every morning after, left in a trance,
You know if we keep on meeting you'll take my soul,
Let's make this our last greeting, cause I must go,

And I love it when you whisper to me...
There's always a promise in the dreams that you think,
There's always a promise in this last drink,
This last drink,

This time I really mean it, it's over now,
Last night we both went too far - you know how,
Today I'm left staring the thousand yards,
Today I know you promised the house of cards,

And I love it when you whisper to me...
There's always a promise in the dreams that you think,
There's always a promise in this last drink,
This last drink,
