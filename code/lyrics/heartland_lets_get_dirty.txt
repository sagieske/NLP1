Song:

Get the motor running hot

Second row, third disc
I still remember that yellow sundress
Blonde hair, blue eyes
And everytime I looked at her my tongue was tied
I was downhome, she was uptown
A girl like that don't want a redneck around
Teacher's pet, cheerleader
How's a country boy like me supposed to meet her

One Friday night I was sitting at a red light
She pulled up in a tricked out Ford truck
Revved up the engine and scared me half to death
Leaned out of the window and said

Let's get dirty, sling a little mud
Three hundred horses underneath my hood
Let's get dirty, I know the perfect spot
Take you down a backroad show you what I've got
Get the motor running hot
Let's get dirty

She found the first dirt road we could go down
Tore through a mudhole and spun her whole truck around
She said buckle up, it's about to get rough
I'll do the driving, you can tell me when you've had enough
Slipping and a sliding, had me working up a sweat
I looked into her eyes and said

Let's get dirty, sling a little mud
Three hundred horses underneath my hood
Let's get dirty, I know the perfect spot
Take you down a backroad show you what I've got
Get the motor running hot
Let's get dirty

I saw a sign that said
Bridge out up ahead
I told her slow down
She hit the gas instead
I looked around
Saw her laughing in the dashboard light
We left the ground like a bullet from A. 45

---- Instrumental ----

We landed hard but we made it to the other side
My heart was pounding like my first rollercoaster ride
She turned the key off, turned to me and smiled and said
You take the wheel for awhile

Let's get dirty, sling a little mud
Three hundred horses underneath my hood
Let's get dirty, I know the perfect spot
Take you down a backroad show you what I've got
Get the motor running hot
Let's get dirty (get dirty) sling a little mud
Three hundred horses underneath my hood
Let's get dirty, I know the perfect spot
Take you down a backroad show you what I've got
Get the motor running hot
