Song:

True about my taste
True about my wealth
The thing about St Petersburg I was never there myself
So come on Yeah come on
Anastasia cried all night, but I couldn't save myself
So come on Yeah come on

I appreciate your courtesy, your well earned politesse
But you got yourself into your own mess
You know the demons in the design
A good idea at the time
Yeah seemed like a good idea at time
Yeah seemed like a good idea at time

Now how it all went down, auto Pilate knows
All I ever asked of him was when the bars were closed
So come on, Yeah come on

I appreciate your courtesy, your well earned politics
But you got yourself into your own mess
You know the demons in the design
A good idea at the time
Yeah seemed like a good idea at time
Yeah seemed like a good idea at time

Now what you gonna do about it?

True about my taste
True about my wealth
But you don't need no help from me, you'll yourself to waste
So come on Yeah come on

Seemed like a good idea at time
Yeah seemed like a good idea at time
