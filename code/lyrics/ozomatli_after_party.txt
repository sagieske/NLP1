Song:

I wonder if we'll ever find a party that lasts all night.
There's a vibe in the city I've never felt before in my life.
Let's all rush and flow, make a big time aftershow party.
If we're gonna get it right got to hold each other tight tonite

Chorus:
And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby
Oye Mami
Donde Esta La Afterparty

You offered a ride, a pleasant surprise
Your whip was on point but it could'nt outshine your eyes
Now I really know why we had to rush the flow darling
No we gotta get it right got to hold each other tight tonite

Chorus:
And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby
Oye Mami
Donde Esta La Afterparty

I only want to hold your hand like darkness in the moon light
And when you wrap your arms around me
I know this is where we should be tonite

Jabu:

To feel this gotta use your soul
And it just aint a party with no O-z-o's
Jump back make you sweat your clothes
And I bet you didn't know/ the whole band got flows
Little lady go on and do your dance
Homeboys stand up and shout
That's what I'm talkin' bout
Everybody go on and tell a friend
That band went and did it again

Chorus:
And the people of the world say...
Oye Baby
Oye Mami
Donde Esta La Afterparty
