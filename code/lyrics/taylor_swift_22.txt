Song:

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah,ah,ah,ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time

I don't know about you
But i’m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But i’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
ah,ah,ah,ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah...
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time

I don't know about you
But i’m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But i’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22

I don’t know about you
22, 22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping 
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you
But i’m feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But i’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're... 22, 22

22, 22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping 
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
