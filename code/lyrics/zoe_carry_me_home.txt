Song:

Carry me home
Sing that old familiar song
It's just you and me
I'm just a little weak
Carry me home
Be my voice when I can't speak
Carry me, carry me, carry me

When it gets too complicated
And the lights are low
And you're standing in the room
And you're all alone
Turn it up
Lift it up
Wake me up
And sell me your dream

Come and be my blanket
When I can't sleep
I wanna be wrapped up
In your skin
Close my eyes
Hold me tight
Be surprised
And sell me your dream

Carry me home
Sing that old familiar song
It's just you and me
I'm just a little weak
Carry me home
Be my voice when I can't speak
Carry me, carry me, carry me
Carry me home [x5]

Carry me home
Carry me, carry me, carry me

When the hope has all gone
And you feel like the only one
And you slide
You cry after all
That is said and done

Carry me home
Sing that old familiar song
It's just you and me
I'm just a little weak
Carry me home
Be my voice when I can't speak
Carry me, carry me, carry me
Carry me home [x5]

Carry me home
Carry me, carry me, carry me

Carry me home
