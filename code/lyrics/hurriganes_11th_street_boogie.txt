Song:

Standing on the corner of eleventh street
Oh just a bum from country
Trying to look real neat
Havenґt got a dollar , i havenґt got a dime
Havenґt got a watch , so i ainґt got the time
Hey good looking like your style
But no dice son , she walks on by
Need some money , needs some wheels
Make a dollar , make a deal
Yeah,yeah,yeah Roxy mother
Yeah,yeah,yeah calling nine
Yeah,yeah,yeah do you love me
Yeah,yeah,yeah iґm on cloud nine
Hey good looking , like your style
But no dice son , she walks on by
Needs some money , needs some wheels
Make a dollar , make a deal
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah
Yeah,yeah,yeah....(Repeat and fade)
