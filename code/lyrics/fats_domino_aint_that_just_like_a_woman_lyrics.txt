Song:

Yes, Adam was happy
As a man could be
Til Eve started messing
With that old apple tree

(CHORUS)
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She's never satisfied

(CHORUS)

Marie Antoinette watched
Those cats at the gate
Then cried in French
Said, let em eat cake

(CHORUS)

Yes, Adam was happy
As a man could be
Til Eve started messing
With that old apple tree

(CHORUS)

You can buy a woman clothes
Give her money on the side
No matter what you do
They're never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman
Yes, that's just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
They'll do it every time
