[Sample:]
"... With A Dozen Roses, Such Would Astound You
The Joy Of Children Laughing Around You, These Are The Makings Of You
And It's True, The Makings Of You"

Boy You Remind Me, Remind Me Of My Gucci Shoes
Everytime You Walk Past, All The Girls Be Looking At You
You Got Style Just Like A Bentley Coupe
And I Be Losing My Mind Everytime I Get Next To You

I Think I'm Falling In Love With You Baby Caught Up In Somehting
That's Moving So Fast
Never Been With Nobody Else You And I Tighter
Than The Jeans On My a**
You Remind Me Of This Thing Something Like
Are. Kelly Singing Bout A Jeep
Boy You're Everything To Me And You're
My You're My Property

Boy You Remind Me Remind Me Of The Ice On My Ring Boys You Remind Me
Of This
These Are The Makings Of You And it's True These Are The
Makings Of You

You Remind Me Of The Very First Time You Remind Me Of The Time
We Made Love Just Like The 25th Day Of Christmas Waiting For
Santa Clause To Show Up You Got A Heart Of Gold Baby You Should
Know Baby You Remind Me Of So Much And Baby You Always Stay On My
Mind Your Just Like My Rims You Shine

Boy You Remind Me Of 26s On My Ride
The Way You're Spinning Around Looking Like A Superstar
Boy You Remind Me Of How Life's Suppose To Be
This Is What You Remind Me And Your My Your My Property

Looking At You Look At Another Baby I Don't Need Another Brother
S** Time Around You I Feel The Same My Body There No Pressure Baby
You Know I Keep It So Real And I Can't Help You Got The Whip Appeal
What's The Deal Tell Me How You Feel Could It Be Me, Me For Eternity
(You And Me For Eternity)

Like The Ice On My Wrist it's Like Kick On My Hip
Mac On My Lips Armor Oil On My Whip Butta On My Shirmp
I'm The Gladys You The Pip I Keep My Hair Flip The Way You Like To See
Me Strip Keep A Money Clip You Remind Me Of A Tip Like A Pair Of Jeans
From Ambercrombie When They Rip Like A Glass Of Wine Everytime I Take
A Sip it's You, You, You, You, Yoooouuu (Awww baby)

Boy You Remind Me, Remind Me Of My Gucci Shoes
Everytime You Walk Pass All The Girls Be Looking At You
(Everytime You Come Around I Loose My Mind Babe)
You Got Style Just Like A Bentley Coupe
(You Got, You Got, Yeahhhh)
And I Be Losing My Mind Everytime I Get Next To You
(No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No)*Fade Out*
