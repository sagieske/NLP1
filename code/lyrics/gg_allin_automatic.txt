Song:

Everything you do is the same, same, same!
Over and over it's like a game, game, game!
Think you're Miss High Society, wowee!
Fu***n' all the rockstars that you meet, f**k me!

It makes no sense the things you do or say girl (automatic)
Cause everything you say comes back to me (automatic)
Don't go play with me emotionally (automatic)
Or I will make you bleed internally (automatic)

Think you are mister know it all, know all!
Standards high but you value small, small, small
Class-A assholes telling you what to do, what to do!
If you're from Boston you gotto be cool, f**k you!
