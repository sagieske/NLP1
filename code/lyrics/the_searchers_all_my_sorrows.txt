Song:

Now there's just one thing that money can't buy
True love that will never die
All my sorrows soon forgotten

Carefree lovers down country lanes
Don't know my grief, can't feel my pain
All my sorrows soon forgotten

But it's too late, my love
Too late, but never mind
All my sorrows soon forgotten

Now there's one more thing that troubles my mind
My love has gone, left me behind
All my sorrows soon forgotten

But it's too late, my love
Too late, but never mind
All my sorrows soon forgotten
