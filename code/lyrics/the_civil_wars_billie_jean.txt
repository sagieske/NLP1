Song:

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round? "
She said, "I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do because the lie becomes the truth"

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand, her schemes and plans
Because we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice, do think twice

She told my baby, we were dancing still three
Then she looked at me, then showed a photo
My baby cried because his eyes were like mine, oh no
Though we'd dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
But she came and stood right by me then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon, she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
