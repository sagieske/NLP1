Go 1, 2, 3, 4

Could someone help me comprehend?
How my wanting to have friends
Is now this monster that I feed
Its popularity I need people think that I'm the deal
It helps me feel like I am real but I think I lost the need
Looking for the Star machine
I don't want any part of it
Everything is here today gone tomorrow Big Star Machine
Ricky Martin or Monudo
Big Star Machine
Vh1, where are they followed
Big Star Machine
How could I have been so shallow?
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Could someone help me comprehend?
How I came to judge my friends
On a Scale of trendiness
And somehow I love them less
Not as hip as they could be
Through the eyes of Star Machine
Its a dump philosophy
Judged by popularity
I don't want any part of it
Everything is here today
Gone tomorrow
Big Star Machine
Ricky Martin or Monudo
Big Star Machine
Vh1, where are they followed
Big Star Machine
How could I have been so shallow?
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Everything is here today
Gone tomorrow
Big Star Machine
Ricky Martin or Monudo
Big Star Machine
Vh1 where are they followed
Big Star Machine
How could I have been so shallow?
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Big Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
Big, Star Machine
