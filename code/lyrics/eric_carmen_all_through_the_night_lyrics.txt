(eric carmen/michael mcbride)

Hey now, sugar
Let me buy you a drink
Don't you tell me your last name
I won't recognize you after tonight
'cause you just won't look the same

Well I could look for an hour or two
Trying to find someone just like you
Why don t you sit right down?
Have a double, let me get to know ya'

All through the night
If you decide it 'll be alright
Gonna make you sweat till the sheets are wet
Now don't say I didn't warn 'ya

All through the night
If you play your hand just right
You're gonna know my bed
Take my hand
And hitchhike home in the morning

You feel so soft and you taste so sweet
Like cold wine in mid-july
Have the finest time when you shake and cry
And the drink's sure got me high

Now that I've already had 'ya
I'm gettin' bored with the idle chat
'bout the place you live, what you do all day
Well honey, the door's got a handle

All through the night
If you decide it'll be alright
Gonna make you sweat till the sheets are wet
Now don't say I didn't warn 'ya

All through the night
If you play your hand just right
You're gonna know my bed
Take my hand
And hitchhike home in the morning

All through the night
If you decide it'll be alright
Gonna make you sweat till the sheets are wet
Now don't say I didn't warn 'ya

All through the night
If you play your hand just right
You're gonna know my bed
Take my hand
And hitchhike home in the morning

If we meet again
Baby, who knows when
In a smoke-filled, sleazy bar
Don't you be surprised if between the flies
I can't tell which one you are

You all look just the same
And I never could remember names
So if you say, "hello" and I still don't know
Well, honey, it's such a shame

All through the night
If you decide it'll be alright
Gonna make you sweat till the sheets are wet
Now don't say I didn't warn 'ya

All through the night
If you play your hand just right
You're gonna know my bed
Take my hand
And hitchhike home in the morning

You're gonna know my bed
Baby, take my hand
And hitchhike home in the morning
