Song:

You must've fallen from the sky
You must've shattered on the runway
You've brought so many to the light
And now you're by yourself

There comes a point in every fight
Where giving up seems like the only way
When everyone one has said goodbye
And now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart
When the rules of Cain, the rights you've made
The owls that caw, for those to blame
The broken glass, the fool that asked
The moving arrow to stop

You must've fallen from the sky
You must've come here in the pourin' rain
You took so many through the light
And now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart
When the ruins of man, the bloodied rag
Ni the fool that bull the prouder hag
The nights they make the rattle crack
The wolves that follow the outed man
The falling star, the way we are divine
The wolves that never ever multiply

You must've fallen from the sky
You must've come here on the wrong way
You came among us every time
But now you're on your own

If you need somewhere to fall apart
Somewhere to fall apart
Will they call you saint, the basket case
The rules of thumb you have to break
The raging skull, The rag to the bull
The nails that drag in either hand
Well I will make my work of that
I know this place
I know this task

You must've fallen from the sky
