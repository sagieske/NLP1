Song:

What have you done! (done, done, done...)
Alone in the dark, I walk into your bedroom,
The blood and the knife that you used to condemn him to his tomb! (this tomb)

This darkness has
Overcome your common sense.
Be honest,
Impulsive actions made a mess.
This darkness
Like a fire burning red.
So vicious,
A heartless monster, not a man.

How could you call me a f*****g monster?! (a monster!)
After everything that I've done for you!

Baby don't scream,
You know I did this all for you and me.
Now just say you forgive me, and that you are happy,
You're driving me crazy, you've driven me crazy!
B***h donÂ’'t scream!
You know I did this all for me!
Now just f*****g forgive me, you better be happy!
You're driving me crazy, you've driven me crazy!

This darkness has
Overcome your common sense.
Be honest,
Impulsive actions made a mess.
This darkness
Like a fire burning red.
So vicious,
A heartless monster, not a man.

Now just close your eyes,
Stop and listen to what you're saying!
Never say goodbye,
You're scaring me!
Innocence will die,
What have you done to my friend? You are not him!
This face is my disguise!
You're scaring me!

Don't lose your head, keep your smile,
Pull it together just for a while.
My darling don't let go at all,
Not ever, no!
Don't be afraid, open your eyes,
You may be in for a surprise.
The light is closer then it may seem.

You will never leave me!
You will never be with anyone else!
This darkness is hallow, your pride you will swallow it whole,
Or it will be the end of you!

So bite your tongue, you will stay strong,
Or a lifeless, worthless, corpse you will become!
One kiss, be forever my mistress!
