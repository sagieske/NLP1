Song:

I got so good in physics while I got beaten phisycally
I went thru a lot just to write this down
Done with the bullies and the bad treats
And all the guys who thinks they own the streets
Oh it's good to know it's almost over

My heartbeat's getting faster
I'm sick of waiting any longer waiting any longer
And I will meet you on the other side
We all can leave with pride
I know that we can make this right

Reff:
Life is calling me now
I'm with you somehow
Let's just pretend that they're all dead (let's just pretend that they're all dead)
What the hell are you waiting for
We don't have to feel this anymore
It's you I'm with tonite we could be anywhere, with anyone anytime

Highschool is almost over

Go straight to your dream now
