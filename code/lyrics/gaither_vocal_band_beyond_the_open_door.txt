Song:

In the things familiar we find security
Resisting all the changes that days and years can bring
When God decides to lead you through an open door
Inviting you to walk in realms you've never known before

Beyond the open door is a new and fresh anointing
Hear the Spirit calling you to go
Walk on through the door for the Lord will go before you
Into a greater power you've never known before

Hear the Spirit calling to wake the living dead
To reach the huddled masses who cry out for living bread
Arise oh mighty army, take up thy shield and sword
For the Father lifts His golden lamp beside the open door

Beyond the open door is a new and fresh anointing
Hear the Spirit calling you to go
Walk on through the door for the Lord will go before you
Into a greater power you've never known before

Beyond the open door is a new and fresh anointing
Hear the Spirit calling you to go
Walk on through the door for the Lord will go before you
Into a greater power you've never known

Where He leads me, I will follow
Where He leads me, I will follow
And where He leads me, I will follow
Into a greater power you've never known before
Beyond the open door
