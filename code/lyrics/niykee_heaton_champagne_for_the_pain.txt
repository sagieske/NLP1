Song:

Late nights waiting, empty fading
I want you again, I want you again
I'm far from sober, won't help me over
I can't pretend, I can't pretend
If I get this just right, I could lay here all night
Because it's too much one cup, tryina fill up
Spaces you left in me

Got up this brand new addictions
About you, about you
Anything that stops me from thinking
About you, about you

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
I don't really wanna feel anything

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
I don't really wanna feel anything

Touch me and I'm back to the first time
Chasing your high, chasing us right
You left me stranded, broken, abandoned
Live for the high, I lived for your high
If I get this just right, I could lay here all night
Too late, so many thangs, poison, I need to change
Because that's you, will you ravage me?

Got up this brand new addictions
About you, about you
Anything that stops me from thinking
About you, about you

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
I don't really wanna feel anything

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
Nu-nu-numb the pain
I don't really wanna feel anything

Phasing through my mind and I think it's the last time
Lips are sweet as wine, so I drink just to pass time
Make me come alive, take me high and I need high
I just wanna have him

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
Nu-nu-numb the pain
I don't really wanna feel anything

I got champagne for the pain
Blacking all the memories
Running through my veins
I don't really wanna feel anything
Trying to escape, I'm my only enemy
Dreams I keep them erased
I don't really wanna feel anything
Nu-nu-numb the pain
I don't really wanna feel anything

Bring on the champagne
So I can numb the pain, numb the pain
I don't really wanna feel anything
Bring on the champagne
So I can numb the pain, numb the pain
I don't really wanna feel anything
