Song:

[Zeke]
You can bet
There's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession
My own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control

Everybody gather around

[SPEAKING]
If troy can tell his secret
Then I can tell mine
I love to bake!

[Jocks]
What?

[ZEKE]
Scones, struedel, even apple pandowdy.

[JOCKS]
Not another sound!

[ZEKE]
I hope to make the perfect crиme Brule

[Cliques]
No, no, noooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Martha]
Look at me
And what do you see?

[braniacs]
Intelligence beyond compare

[Martha]
But inside I am stirring
Something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share

[All]
Open up, dig way down deep

[MARTHA]
Hip-hop is my passion
I love to pop, and lock, jam and break!

[Krarnoff]
Is that even legal?

[All]
Not another peep

[MARTHA]
It's just dancing
And sometimes, I think it's even cooler then homework!

[Cliques]
No, no, noooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It's better by far
To keep things are they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Ripper]
Dudes!

[Cliques]
Not you too!

[Ripper]
Listen well,
I'm ready to tell

[Rebels]
About a need that I cannot deny

[Ripper]
Dude, there is no explanation
For this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly

[All]
Speak your mind you'll be heard

[Ripper]
If troy can be in a show
Then I'm coming clean
I play the cello

[Mongo]
Awesome! what is it?

[Ripper]
*DOES A AIR CELLO SOLO, THE MUSIC CATCHES FIRE THROUGHOUT THE CAFETERIA *

[SKATERDUDE2]
Do you have to wear a costume?

[SKATERDUDE1]
Coat and tie.

[SKATER PEOPLE]
That's uncalled for!

[Cliques]
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't' mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Cliques]
No, no, noooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It it's better by far
To keep things are they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo

[Sharpay]
This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just got to say
I do not understand
Something is really

[RYAN]
Something's not right

[SHARPAY]
Really wrong

[SHARPAY AND RYAN]
And we gotta get things
Back were they belong
We can do it

[Skater dude1]
Gotta play

[Cliques]
Stick with what you know

[Rebels]
We can do it

[Martha]
Hip- hop hooray

[Braniacs]
She has got to go

[Ryan and sharpay]
We can do it

[Zeke]
Crиme Brule

[Cliques]
Keep your voice down low

[Cliques]
Not another peep
Not another word
Not another sound

[SHARPAY]
Everybody quiet!

[Spoken]

[Gabriella]
Why is sharpay staring at you?

[Taylor]
Not me, you

[Spoken by gabrella]
Because of the call backs?

[Taylor]
Lets face it, no one has beaten out sharpay for a part in a musical since kindergarten.

[Cliques]
Noooooooooooooo, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't' mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quoooooooooooo

[Cliques]
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It it's better by far
To keep things are they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status
Stick to the status
Stick to the status quo

[All]
