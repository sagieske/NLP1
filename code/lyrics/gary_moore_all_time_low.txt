Song:

You've had your share of troubles.
Lord knows you've had your share of pain.
You've had your share of troubles.
Lord knows you've had your share of pain.

When it all comes down to you,
You're puttin' on a brave face.
But it just takes some bad luck
To put you in your place.
When there's no place to run to,
When there's no place to go,
You know you've had an all time low.
Oh.

You thought the hard times were behind you,
But boy were you ever wrong.
Those hard times been followin' you
Ever since the day that you were born.

You've had your share of troubles.
Lord knows you've had your share of pain.

When it all comes down to you,
You're puttin' on a brave face.
But it just takes some bad luck
To put you in your place.
When there's no place to run to,
When there's no place to go,
You know you've had an all time low.
All time low, yeah.

You've had your share of troubles.
Lord knows, Lord knows you've had your share of pain.
You've had your share of troubles.
Lord knows, Lord knows you've had your share of pain.

When it all comes down to you,
You're puttin' on a brave face.
But it just takes some bad luck
To put you in your place.
When there's no place to run to,
When there's no place to go,
You know you've had an all time low.

You've had an all time low.
You've had an all time low.
All time low.
