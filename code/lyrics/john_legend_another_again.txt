Song:

Oh so we did it again
Knowing we should quit it
But we simply won't admit again
It feels good it's so good
But I won't do it again

It's so dramatic again
After we go at it
We get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it then I hate it
She's my favorite

Again wasting time
Can't help but she's so fine
Oh I like her style
And I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye bye

Chorus:
& again & again & again
& again & again & again
We do it again
We do it again & we do it again
& again & again & again& again & again & again
We do it again
& we want it again and we want it again

So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it
And we know it but she's naked again
We get wasted then I taste it then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
'cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
Then I'll fight her again
So it's over but I told her to come over

Again wasting time
She's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh she's not the best but she's all that I know
As much as we may try can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye bye

Chorus:
& again & again & again
& again & again & again
We do it again
We do it again & we do it again
& again & again & again& again & again & again
We do it again
& we want it again and we want it again

So I've gotta new friend
I wish I could forget you
But I miss you wanna kiss you again
Oh she's like you but she's not you
Gotta find you again
So we remember again
The middle of December & I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her it's not over there's another again

[Chorus til fade]
