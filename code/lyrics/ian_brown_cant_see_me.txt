Song:

Down by the river side I waited there for you
Take you back in time
You're in suspension, hey I caught you
You cannot hide, it's all inside, easy
She knows you can't see me

Yes Mr Miser, Mr, Mr Mystery she's saying to me
Saying he can't see you, he can't free you, he can't be you
He just wanna be you
He needs a dealer as a healer

I've seen that expression on your face
I could have sent you to that place
Expression can't see me

Yes, I'm reminded of those days
Take you back in time, it's all inside
Here comes a reason to my rhyme
The man used to fly, he used to fly easy
But know you can't see me

I know mine, mine know me
I can sail upon your sea
I can sail upon your sea so easy she knows you can't see me

I've seen that expression on your face
I could have sent you to that place
I know you can't see me
I know you can't see me
