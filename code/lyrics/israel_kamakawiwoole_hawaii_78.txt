Ua mau ke ea O ka aina I ka pono O hawaii
(rough transalation: The constant, wet Rain Gives Life to the land
And brings goodnesschange to Hawaii)
If just for a day our king and queen
Would visit all these islands and saw everything
How would they 'bout the changing of our land
Could you just imagine if they were around
And saw highways on their sacred grounds
How would they feel if they 'bout this modern city life
Tears would come from each others eyes as
They would stop to realize
That our people are in great, great danger now
How would they feel
Would their smiles be content
Rather then cry
Cry for the gods, cry for the people
Cry for the lands that were taken away
And in it you'll find Hawaii
Could you just imagine if they came back
And saw traffic lights and railroad tracks
How would they feel about this modern city life
Tears would come from each others eyes as
They would stop to realize
That our land is in great, great danger now
All of the fighting that the king had done
To conquer all these islands
Now there's condominiums
How would he feel if saw Hawaii now
How would he feel
Would his smiles be content
Rather then cry
Cry for the gods, cry for the people
Cry for the lands that were taken away
And in it you'll find Hawaii
ua mau ke ea O ka aina I ka pono O hawaii
