Song:

There's times where I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But, you see the colors in me like no one else
And behind your dark glasses you're...
You're something else

Chorus:
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But, lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

(Repeat Chorus)

So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
Better... Better...

Lady Saw:
For real
'cause I'm a need to tell
You are me real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire
You were always burnin'
Any time you're around
My body keeps callin'
For your touch
Your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There's another side to you
That so many adore
Aside from your temper
Everything is secure
You're good for me, baby
Of that, I'm a sure
Over and over, again
Me want more

Gwen:
You've used up all your coupons
And all you've got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be

(Repeat Chorus)

You're really lovely
Underneath it all
And you want to love me
Underneath it all
And I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
And you're really lovely
