Song:

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want
Your story to remain untold

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me
A highway with no one on it
Treasure to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me
Eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in time of dryness
A harbor in the tempest

But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want
Your love to work out right
To last me through the night

You say you want
Diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
And your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You, all I want is
You

When all I want is you
