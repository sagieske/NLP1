Song:

Intro

If the warmth of the sun ever turns to cold
It's you who'd warm my soul
Though the strong driving rains of life leave me in pain
Still, I will remain
With you, no pain's too great

Refrain 1:
Even if the waters of the sea turn into stone
I know with you, I'll never thirst alone
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore

All the weight of the world on my shoulders, I will bear
Still, it will be fair
If the edge of a love ever cuts my heart in two

I will run to you
Your words will see me through

Refrain 2:
If it took the flame of life to make this feeling stay
I'd gladly give up everything it would take
Forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore

Ad lib

Woh

Refrain 3:
Even if the earth and sky collide within my soul
I know in you, my spirit can be whole
Forevermore (forevermore) (4x)
Forevermore
