Song:

We live in a world
Where a man is judged by the color of his skin
We can't win
Not the content of his character
They scared of you
22 million black in America
You better stand your area
75 percent population of the prison system
N****s listen
N****s listen
N****s listen
Outlawz on a mission

Verse 1: Napoleon

So more gun shots
By some young n****s
And now the media consider y'all some dumb n****s
And where you at
I done came from that
So I know what's on your mind when you're cocking your nine back
Busting your bullets at them n****s on the corner
And you aim 7 5 till your victim is a goner
But it's more than life
And I don't blame you
Matter of fact I blame your parents for the s**t you gonna do
There's a lot of n****s under ten getting shot by the nine
8 of them died and left 7 of them crying
For the 5th and 6th time
I'm trying to tell you dog
You done pulled through
N***a I know that's where he are
And the third second and first is when the welfare kicks in
We joined by nothing
'Cause your?
Drinking
Buying crack
Go for drugs again
And it make you want to go and bust your gat again
But if you got a problem grab a pen
Write a letter
And send it to the Outlawz
We'll try to make it better
My young soldier
You ain't no dumb soldier
Keep your mind on your dream
And you a pro soldier

Verse 2: Young noble

Hey yo
I spit, rip for Pac and Yak
I love y'all both
That's why I rap with a grudge and keep my enemies close
Memories float
Nothing else to do but smoke
Now I'm numb with a lump in my throat
I'm scoffed up
Constipated with pain
Hating the rain
We all get wet
And pretty much when you close to death
I think you live by the gun
You die by the judge
And if my girl have a son
I'ma raise him better than I was
A little time does justice to the heart
You should ask your little boy why he rushing to the park
Everyday after school
You wonder why he love there?
They got guns drugs and plenty of thugs there
No care
That's why I speak on s**t
To you parents out there
Don't sleep on s**t
Raise your kids
Come on you made the kids
We got kids killing kids
Doing major bids
Damn

Chorus:

I never really got a chance to say good-bye
I hope you're thankful you lived your life
And nothing keeps that before your eyes
I never really got a chance to say good-bye
And even though you're gone
You're always on my mind
I never really got a chance to say goodbye

Verse 3: Edi

To all my youngsters out there
Trying to burn something
Will you pay attention a minute
You might learn something
'Cause look
All they want to do is lock you up and make some dough off you
And when your a** finally die
They'll find a hole for you
I know it ain't no love
It seem cold to you
But yous a soldier
Got to keep your goals close to you
'Cause 25 with an L ain't closer junior
Now in society
You're labeled as a loser junior
2 times at that
So close to your 3rd
Only 22 now what the f**k you gonna do
Convicted felons
They don't get no work
We all know that
Now you forced to draw back
You seen the cycle
They don't call it the system for nothing
Systematic ways to get you to your grave
But you heard it before
You ain't gonna listen to Edi
You gonna have to go through it
But please believe me
Ain't no glory in pain
A soldier story in vain
You n****s gobbled by the game
Aint no glory in pain
A soldier story in vain
You n****s gobbled up by the mutha fuckin game

Verse 4: Kastro

It's a long long dark road out of hell
I've been there
I can tell you the story well
Most don't make it
10 out of 12
And the 2 left fighting themselves
We sit in desperate need
Searching for a cure
Us youngsters indeed
We deserve much more
It's war
'Cause we don't get along with each other
God damn
We need to get it together
For real

Chorus

Verse 5: Napoleon

I got 50 shots for every?
These pigs is more crooked than some snakes on my block
They gave him a choice
He had to ride or die
Since bullets don't die
Oz can you tell me how he died
Stay ahead of your game
Young star
Grow eyes
Stay away from them haters
Also 1 time
I respect the game
I'm real serious with mine
It's like they lost
Playing on furious with mine

[Edi talking]
Uh
So serious
You know
It's all about will and how strong you are
If you can stand it
Stand the pressure and stay strong youngsters
Move up

Chorus
