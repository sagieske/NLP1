Song:

I feel there's something that's hidden inside,
Creeps up my spine and takes over my mind
I can't control it, no
I think I'm losing control

You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
(Stuck in here with me)
You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
(You're stuck in here with me)

One more word and we'll cut out your eyes
One more time left to say your goodbyes
(So say 'em)
We cannot we cannot stop the growth
We cannot we cannot stop the growth
Candlelight melts all my shadows away
Thanks for the hate cause it's fueling my flames
You can't control us, no
I think you're losing control

You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
(Stuck in here with me)
You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
(Stuck in here with me)
One more word and we'll cut out your eyes
One more time left to say your goodbyes
(So say 'em)
We cannot we cannot stop the growth
We cannot we cannot stop the growth
One more word and we'll cut out your eyes
One more time left to say your goodbyes
(So say 'em)
We can't, we cannot stop the growth
We can't, we cannot stop bad blood
Oh
You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
You just don't get it do you
I'm not stuck here with you
You're stuck in here with me
One more word and we'll cut out your eyes
One more time left to say your goodbyes
(So say 'em)
We can't, we cannot stop the growth
We can't, we cannot stop bad blood
