Song:

When she walks in the room, everybody gets quiet
You can hear hearts start beating inside
And the way that she moves
You just can't deny it
They all wish that they could hold her
You can see it in their eyes

She's everybody's dream girl
Everybody's dream girl
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

Well, I woke up this morning
Found that determined
That today was gonna be the day
And I gathered all my courage
Walked right up to her
I stumbled and I fumbled for the right words to say

She's everybody's dream girl
Oh, everybody's dream girl
I got to make her mine
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

One way or another
Gonna tell her that I love her
I keep trying every day
'Til I find a way

Everybody's dream girl
Oh, she's everybody's dream girl
I wanna make her mine
Everybody's dream girl
I'll see you in my dreams tonight

She's everybody's dream girl
I got to find a way
Everybody's dream girl
Maybe today's the day
Everybody's dream girl
Everybody's dream girl
