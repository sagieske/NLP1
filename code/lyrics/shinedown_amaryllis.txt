Song:

In a while now I will feel better
I'll face the weather before me
In a while now I'll race the irony
And buy back each word of my eulogy

All the uninvited tragedies
Step outside

Ask yourself now
Where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the moment you can't forget

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So far out of reach
Oh, I wish you'd open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom

Stay a while now
Undress your colors
'Cause they're like no others
I've ever seen
I could get used to your company
Step inside

Ask yourself now
Where would you be without
Days like this
When you finally collide
With the motions you can't resist

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So far out of reach
Oh, I wish you'd open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis

(Solo)

In a while now
I will feel better
I will be better

So do I remind you of
Someone you never met
A lonely silhouette
And do I remind you of
Somewhere you wanna be
So far out of reach
Oh, I wish you'd open up for me
'Cause I wanna know you
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
Bloom
Amaryllis
