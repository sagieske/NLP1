Song:

When I was 30 years old I had 30 million
I had 30 million I had 30 million (x4)

Pardin me but my intials R&D not R&B excuse me so when I throw
Dem B's up this aint pleasure p treasure me measure me bloodline
Thick my acess street cutthroat turn yo turtle neck into a wet tee
And I'm comin threw the airport louie up louie like I'm a king what you mean
Diamonds rings dnt pose to boost my self-esteem want my ni***z rich as me
Dey might be myself as dream cause this is a selfish world toss me dinner
It taste real sweet.

When I was 30 years old I had 30 million
I had 30 million I had 30 million (x4)

1980's dope game made meh dope game raise meh dope game paid meh
