Song:

Gather up your loved ones, gather up your friends
‘Cause this is when the bad guy, a bad guy wins.
Gather up your loved ones, gather up your friends
‘Cause this is when the bad guy, a bad guy wins.

Now there once was a man
Who was tall and handsome
The best shot in the land
Not to mention good at dancing
A hit with the ladies
A heartthrob with the daughters
Cool with the guys
Regular Roy Rogers
He was a man of his word
And he did what he said
That is, until an outlaw shot him dead

Na na na na na na na na…

Now there's whiskey in the water
And blood in the creek
The outlaw has a glass eye and a scar on his cheek
The town hall's a saloon
And the women are whores
No houses around to put locks on the doors
He dreamt he was a king, safe in his bed
That's when another outlaw shot him dead

Na na na na na na na na…

(2 x)
Gather up your loved ones,
Gather up your friends
‘Cause this is when the bad guy
The bad guy wins.
Pray to a church that God forgives your sins
‘Cause this is when the bad guy,
The bad guy wins

Na na na na na na ...
Shot him dead
