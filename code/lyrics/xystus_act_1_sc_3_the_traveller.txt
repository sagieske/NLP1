Song:

[Diegu:]
I can't be sure of where I stand
Who I am
All I know, I am alone -
All alone with my thoughts

Dissipating - I feel nothing
Still a presence's surely watching
Always watching me
30 years now - All my life
It's breathing down my neck
I'm ready for... 

The pain in me
Bring the pain in me
Time has told me nothing but lies
All of this time
I've depended on lies

Dissipating - I feel nothing
Still a presence's surely watching
Always watching me
30 years - All my life
It's breathing down my neck
I'm ready... 

This feels... I was mistaken
All that I feel is love
There's no need to be scared now
All I foresee is clear
As clear and as bright as can be
I've been a fool for all to see

This feels... I was mistaken
All that I feel is love
There's no need to be scared now
All I foresee is clear

I'm sure I was mistaken
Now all I need - is time
