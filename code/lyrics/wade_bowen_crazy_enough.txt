Song:

To fool my soul
I've heard all they're alibis
About being insane
Being a little off the edge
If you want to be successful
In this world of loneliness

Oh am I
Am I crazy enough
Is this life what I've always dreamed of
Oh it raises all kinds of questions
Yeah, it stirs my pot of thoughts
Am I, am I crazy enough

Many a man has driven this road
Yeah, many a man has died
Trying to chase what they believe
Forget what they were trying to find
The desire to please so many
It gets washed away with time
When you realize you're only human
There's nothing more to compromise

Oh am I
Am I crazy enough
Is this life what I've always dreamed of
Oh it raises all kinds of questions
Yeah, it stirs my pot of thoughts
Am I, am I crazy enough

Have you ever chased the devil
Oh and followed him home
Knocked upon his door
Went inside and used his phone
This old world I choose to live in
Isn't what I thought it'd be
It's like escaping from prison
And realizing you ain't free

Oh am I
Yeah am I crazy enough
Is this life what I've always dreamed of
Well it raises all kinds of questions
Yeah, it stirs my pot of thoughts
Oh am I, am I crazy enough

Oh Well I guess I'm
Well I guess I'm just crazy enough
