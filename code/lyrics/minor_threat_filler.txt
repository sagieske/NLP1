Song:

What happened to you? You're not the same. Something in your head made a
Violent change.
It's in your head. Filler.
You call it religion. You're full of s**t.
Was she really worth it? She cost you your life. You'll never leave her
Side. She's gonna be your wife.
You call it romance. You're full of s**t.
You're brain is clay. What's going on? You picked up a bible. And now
You're gone.
You call it religion. You're full of s**t.
Filler.
