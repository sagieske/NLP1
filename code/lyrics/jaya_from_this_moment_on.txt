Song:

Wondering what it's gonna take
To find me a place called happiness
Somewhere that hearts don't ever break
Destiny carry me
To the river of my sweetest dreams
You were a heart beat away
And I knew I would find you someday
Chorus
From this moment on
Until my life is done
There was me and you
And that's all we need
We'll go wherever life may lead
From this moment on
You're my only one
All the lonely days and nights are done
'Cause we're together
From this moment on
I was so blind to learn my lessons
Never this wild romantic soul
Fate was the burning flame that burned me
When love had left me in the cold
Reality feels so good
'Cause I'm touching something real and true
And now, whatever I'll do it forever
I'll do it with you
(Repeat Chorus)
It's funny how you fin'lly know that
Someday, somewhere, someone's meant for you
You can lead the search and waiting
Hoping, praying behind you
I know where love gets through
From this moment on
'Cause we're together
(Repeat Chorus)
