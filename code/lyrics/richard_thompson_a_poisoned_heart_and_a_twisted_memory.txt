Song:

O you took my word and you took my key
You took my pride and you took my dignity
How can I still pretend
To be what a man should be

Well, whatever I say is in a book
Whatever I do there's someone there to look
You just can't shake a man
The way that I've been shook

Now is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

O see that lifer doing his time
If I could have his place and he'd have mine
We'd be no better off
On either side of the line

Well, you took my job and you put me to sleep
You feed me money, you treat me like a creep
Wish I could get away
But I must be in it too deep

Tell me is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory

Well, you tell me you're going to get in touch
You send me a letter that reads like double-Dutch
You say, you're bound to lose,
You're a little such-and-such

You got my number, you got my rank
You drained my head, you drained my petrol tank
And when I die of shame
I won't even know who to thank

Now, now, is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
O is this the way it's supposed to be
Is this the way it's supposed to be
A poisoned heart and a twisted memory
