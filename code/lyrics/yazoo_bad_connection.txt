Song:

Morning this morning the curtains are shut
I'll ring you in the morning but the phone's been cut
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day (Oh can you hear me?)
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me?)
The radio reporter said the line's all dead
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day (Oh can you hear me?)
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me?)

Chorus
I'd wish they'd fix the wires cause my baby don't know
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go
Can you hear me
Can you hear me at all
Gotta get the operator make a telephone call

And if I write a letter it won't get there on time
I'll only reach you baby on the telephone line
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day (Oh can you hear me?)
Can you hear me (Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me?)
My car's all ready and my bags are all packed
I'm late already and I won't be back
Can you hear me? (Oh can you hear me?)
I've been calling all day (Oh can you hear me?)
Can you hear me? (Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me?)
I'd wish they'd fix the wires 'cause my baby don't know
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go (I'd wish they'd fix the wires and I'm ready to go)
Can you hear me, can you hear me at all
Gotta get the operator, make a telephone call

How can I help you?
Hello!?
You're playing with the phone, I will continue
Transferred no voice, ??????????
I'm talking to the person of ??????????, no voice is at the other end of this telephone
Gets his little kicks playing pervert

I'd wish they'd fix the wires 'cause my baby don't know
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go (I'd wish they'd fix the wires and I'm ready to go)
Can you hear me, can you hear me at all
Gotta get the operator, make a telephone call
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
Ooh can you hear me
