Song:

[Cl] Balmain to ktz
Many style from A to Z
Jeremy Scott; Givenchy
B***h you ain't got s**t on me
Chrome hearts
Fendi furs
Dripped in s***s you never heard

Ridin' down Seoul city
Black on black Lamborghini
Haters can't never see me
Come and get me, too slow
I'm 'bout that paper chasing
Body fly, face amazing
Burn burn, keeps it blazin'
Too hot to handle, can't touch this

You think you with it, with it
But you can't hit it, hit it
You know I got it, got it
Cuz I'm so bout it, bout it
I let them hoes know
I run this show, show
We get it poppin'
(And we stick you for your dough)

[Minzy] Cuz I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah I'm so bad, bad
That I'm so hood, hood (x2)

[Bom] Can't nobody hold us down
Nothing's gonna take us down
And you think you can stop it
But we just can't stop it tonight
Can't nobody hold us down

[Dara] Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
We gon' keep it goin' bout to run this town
Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
Cuz we keep rockin', we we rock rockin' (Yeah)

[Cl] So watch out; when we come for you
Cuz playtime is done for you
It's my time and it's my time
I'm pound for pound, best to ever come around

Be patient it's never been done
We're asians we rise with the sun
Invasion, no mercy
Takeover, we thirsty

Every show we shut it down
Blow your speakers with (this sound)
Build you up then break you down
We comin' to your town

[Minzy] Cuz I'm so bad, bad
But I'm so good, good
Yeah I'm so bad, bad
That I'm so hood hood (x2)

[Bom] Can't nobody hold us down
Nothing's gonna take us down
And you think you can stop it
But we just can't stop it tonight
Can't nobody hold us down

[Dara] Can't nobody, can't nobody hold us down
We gon' keep it goin' bout to run this town
Can't nobody can't nobody hold us down
Cuz we keep rockin', we we rock rockin' (Yeah x3)

[All] Let's rock!
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now all I wanna do is
Make you rock
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now make em say na-Na-Na-Na

Let's rock!
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now all I wanna do is
Make you rock
Just take it to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
Now make em say
Na-Na-Na-Na (x3)
