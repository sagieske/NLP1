Song:

Her bones are buried in the backyard along with my integrity
I tested your honor you questioned my faith
Now look where you are you're right where you'll stay

It's time for you to know that I'm loathing
You'll never see me again

I can see your eyes have been wandering slowly
Do you have any last words?

Oh no I can see you've been lying through your teeth
Who's breathing now?

I hope your ready to leave this place cause you are going either way
We've fallen far too distant

All you were good for was everything but I guess that wasn't enough to keep you alive
I'm horrified by my potential
I am so capable of terrible things
I really hate goodbyes

There's no way that I could just let it slide
I did this to you
I did this to you

And all this time I never knew regret is for you
For you

Oh no I can see that you have been lying through your teeth
Who's breathing now?

I hope you are ready to leave this place cause you are going either way
We've fallen far too distant.

I'm ready to forget
I'm ready to forget
I'm ready to forget you
