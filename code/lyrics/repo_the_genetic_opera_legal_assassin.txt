Song:

Ghostly whispers:
Assassin... Murderer... Monster(etc)
Nathan(x6)

Nathan:
Where did our daughter go?
It's me she must escape.
My burdens I can't erase.
The mother I might have saved.

Ghostly whispers:
Assassin... Murderer... Monster

Nathan:
Marni, I need you now.
Look what I've become.
The nightmare that she should fear
Is the father you left alo~ne!

Ghostly whispers:
Assassin... Murderer... Monster(x3)

Nathan:
The years roll by without you, Marni.
17 have come and gone.
I raised our Shilo with the best intentions.
But there is something I can't tell her.
I am lost without you here!
I am only living out a lie!

Shilo can never leave.
She is my everything.
Nothing can bring you back.
Shilo is all I have!

Ghostly whispers:
Assassin... Murderer... Monster(x3)

Nathan:
The years roll by without you, Marni.
17 have come and gone.
I raised our Shilo with the best intentions.
But there is something I can't tell her.
I am lost without you here!
I am only living out a lie!

Ghostly whispers:
Assassin! Assassin! Assassin!

Nathan/Repo Man:
I'm the monster! (Assassin!)
I'm the villain! (Assassin!)
What perfection! (Assassin!)
What precision! (Assassin!)
Keen incisions, I deliver!
Unscathed organs, I deliver!
Repossessions, I deliver!
I'm the Repo, Legal Assassin!
