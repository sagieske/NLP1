Song:

Shock no, too many people in your life, yeah
Old times, too many old times in your life, yeah
Some people just not long
In well in your heart's eye
Some people just not long in a, well in your heart's rhyme
Too many nights
Too many nights well on your knees, on your knees, yeah
And she said so long
Well so long
Shock no, too many people in your life, yeah
Old times, too many old times in your life, yeah
Some people just not long
In well in your heart's rhyme, oh right
Some people just not long it, Well in your heart's rhyme
Oh right
Too many nights, Too many nights well on your knees
On your knees yea

[Chorus:]
