Song:

Oooooohh(yeah)

My life was just a lonely thing
I never used to laugh or sing
You gave me hope and you made me strong
And your the reason for this song

Angel.

[Chorus:]
You are here, you are mine
Sweet and lovely angel
Please be near, please be kind
Oh I love you Angel.

(Mmm hmm, Ohhh oh ohhhh)

I was blind I could not see
Till you came down to rescue me
Your god's creation and that's no lie
Cause I see heaven in your eyes

[Chorus:]

Angel...

[Instrumental]

I was blind I could not see
Till you came down to rescue me
Your god's creation and that's no lie
Cause I see heaven in your eyes

[Chorus:]

(Ohhhh, Angel)

Oh Angel!

[Angel... Angel... Angel...]
