Song:

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea, 
I'll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see, 
I'll be the light to guide you

Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like 1 2 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

Woooooooh, Woooooooh
Yeah, Yeah

If you're tossing and you're turning and you just can't fall asleep, 
I'll sing a song beside you
And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me, 
Everyday I will remind you, ohh

Find out what we're made of
When we are called to help our friends in need

You can count on me like 1 2 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

Wooooooh, Wooooooh
Yeah, Yeah

You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
I'll never let go, never say goodbye

You know you can count on me like 1 2 3
I'll be there
And I know when I need it I can count on you like 4 3 2
And you'll be there
Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh yeah

Oohhhh, ohhhhh 
You can count on me cause I can count on you
