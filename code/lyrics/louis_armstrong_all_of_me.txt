Song:

All of me... Why not take all of me
Can't you see... I'm no good without you
Take my lips..... I want to lose them
Take my arms.... I'll never use them

Your goodbye... Left me with eyes that cry
How can i.... Go on dear without you
You took the part.... That once was my heart
So why not take all of me

[Instrumental]

All of me... Now please take all of me
Can't you see... I'm no good without you
Take my lips..... I'd rather lose them
Take these arms.... I'll never, never, never, ever use them

Your goodbye... Left me with eyes that cry
How can i.... Go on dear without you
You took that part.... What once was my heart
So why not take all of me

Baby please take all of me
