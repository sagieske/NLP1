Song:

You know better babe
You know better babe
Than to look at it
Look at it like that
You know better babe
You know better babe
Than to talk to it
Talk to it like that
Don't give it a hand
Offer it a song
Honey make this easy
Leave it to the land
This is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it
It will come back

You know better babe
You know better babe
Than to smile at me
Smile at me like that
You know better babe
You know better babe
Than to hold me just
Hold me just like that
I know who I am when I'm alone
Something else when I see you
You don't understand
You should never know
How easy you are to need
Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me
I will come back

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorway
Through the cold I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I want you baby tonight as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door

Don't you hear me howlin' babe?
Don't you hear me howlin' babe?
Don't you hear me howlin' babe?
Don't you hear me howlin?
Don't you hear me howlin?
Don't you hear me howlin' babe?
