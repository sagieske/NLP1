Song:

He embarrasses his child and wife
Lord, he leads a miserable life
But still he thinks the bottle in his right hand
If' he can tear down more than he's ever built before
A man can be a drunk sometimes
But a drunk can't be a man.

He left your business lag behind
For the nightlife he can find
Why he does all this he'll never understand
And in the morning when he wakes up
Lord, he can't wait to fill his cup
A man can be a drunk sometimes
But a drunk can't be a man.

For he goes from Dr. Jekyle to Mr. Hyde
He seems bound to have the devil for his guide
If he keeps on reachin' out
Lord, he needs a helping hand
But a man can be a drunk sometimes
But a drunk can't be a man.

Yes, man can be a drunk sometimes
But a drunk can't be a man...
