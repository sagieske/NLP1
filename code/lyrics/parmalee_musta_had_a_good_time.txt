Song:

Hey, y'all, is that my dog up on the roof?
And, good God, why's my car out in the pool?
All I 'member was a phone call, now the party's on
Somebody knockin' at my door

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night...

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess,
Oh Man, who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose

And I don't know what the hell went on round here last night,
But we musta had a good time

Hey y'all why's my bed not in my room?
And, good God, how did my face get black and blue?
All I remember was a bring it on, a pour it strong,
And the girls all getting down!

Now I'm picking up beer cans, what a mess, Oh Man,
Who's that passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

Now I don't know what the hell went on round here last night,
But we musta had a good time!

I sure could use a cold one, right about now...

Cause I'm picking up beer cans,
Oh Man, somebody's passed out in the yard?
All that's left in the fire pit's one of my lawn chairs
And a piece of siding off my barn
Somebody doin donuts musta hit the mailbox
Cause it's laying out there in the road
There's a flood in the bathroom
A hog in kitchen, a dude on my couch with a bloody nose
I guess we used the table top for a game of beer pong
And the back porch for a dance floor
Somebody took a shower rod, turned into a strip pole
Man, there's a hole punched through my door!

I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
I don't know what the hell went on round here last night
But, we musta had a good time!

Heh, heh, heh... Yeah we musta had a good time!
We shore had a good time!
We always have a good time!
