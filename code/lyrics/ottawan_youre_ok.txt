Song:

You're O. K.
Your smart
You're in
...

I've got so many problems
My life is such a mess
I need some tender lovin'
Just give me your address.
You've got so many problems
Your life is such a mess
But if you start complaining
No girl's gonna say: yes
You're O. K.
You're smart
You're in
...

Yes I know
Yes I know
I'm a supergirl
And I love to be with you
You've got a style and your smile means the world to me
But I won't marry you

Well
You can call me after eight
Hot number 31024
If you should care to go
To the midnight show
And if you're still in shape
Together we could taste
The greatest strawberry sunday on the Camps-Elysees
You're O. K.
You're smart
You're in
...

It's easier together
Than being all alone
Life can be much better
When you're not on your own
It's easier together
Than being alone
But when love is all what matters you're feelin' like a clown.

You're O. K.
You're smart
You're in
...

Yes I know
Yes I know
I'm a supergirl
...
You stay up sitting there
Lonely as can be
Better dance for me
Better sing with me

You're O. K.
You're smart
You're in
...
