Song:

Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everything must change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain come from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes everything must change

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that the way of time
Nothing and know one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain come from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky

(4X)
Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

And music, makes me cry
