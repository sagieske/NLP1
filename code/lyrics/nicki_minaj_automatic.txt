Song:

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor get with
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

It's automatic I'm a run away train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go I go hard
I'm a show you best side tonight-night-ni-i-ight

It's automatic my conditions unknown
There's no remedy and no antidote
It's just the way that I am
Nicki nicki so bad tonight-night-ni-I-ight

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor get with
No no it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic

It's automatic some might call it insane
I asure I'll be stuck in your brain
You'll be fallin for me boy
Just like a domino tonight-night-ni-i-ight

It's automatic when I'm rockin the beat
Systematically I'm droppin your heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki nicki so bad tonight-night-ni-i-ight

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm monster on the floor get with
No no it's automatic, it's automatic

Press rewind
P-p-press rewind
It's automatic
I-I'm einstein
I'm lookin for that einstein
Wales London Ireland
Scotland I have idoled in
South Africa and Brazil
Shut the club down
Bring the bill
Ri-ri-ri-ri-ring the bill
Br-bri-bri-bri-bring the bill
Bri-bri-bring the bill
Shut the club down
Bring the bill

I can't control the way I'm movin my hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor get with
No no it's automatic, it's automatic
