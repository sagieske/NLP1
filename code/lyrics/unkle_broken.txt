Song:

Gavin Clark :

Dead state I can feel the weight
Light streaming in through an open grate
Two thread score tearing up the floor
Out in the alley with the trigger draw

Numb hands I can see the strand
Hold it together with a severed ban

Three lost years I've been crying here
I'm over, I'm over, I'm over, I'm broken

Strung out with wings of the dawn
Hole in the black soul in the storm
Torn down through the cracks in the dark
We're miles adrift we're inches apart

I'm hit I can feel the grit
Sat in the asher on the beaten brick
Two thread main running through the vein

Out in the centre with a mirrored cane
Numb feet I can hear you speak
Hold it together with a severed streak

Three lost years I've been crying here
I'm over, I'm over, I'm over, I'm broken

Strung out with wings of the dawn
Hole in the black soul in the storm
Torn down through the cracks in the dark
We're miles adrift we're inches apart

Stood up on the side og the earth
Thrown back to the track to the dirt
Two thread lose an hour a day
We're miles adrift, we're inches away...

Hold it together with a severed bank
Can't feel the blood
