Song:

Just like desire
Won't disappear
With everything behind you
There's no more tears
And now the daylight's ending
We'll surely make it clear

Just like the hand
Over your screams
This is your future
That's swallowing your dreams
And as the sunlight exits
You will believe in this

Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you say you won't
Lie down and take it
Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you f*****g move
Lie down and take it

Nothing can stop what has begun
And you can't change what has been done
And now you belong to me
Belong to me (x2)

Just like the heel
Upon your spine
Without wanting
You are stripped of all your pride
And now the world stops to wait
You're frozen here in time

And now the scars
Will never fade
They stretch across your legs
With everything you gave
Now when you hear my name
You'll always be afraid

Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you say you won't
Lie down and take it
Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you f*****g move
Lie down and take it

Nothing can stop what has begun (You cannot keep me away)
And you can't change what has been done
And now you belong to me
Belong to me (x2)

Pull the string
It's wrapped around that memory
Stored in flames
It's all a game plan
On your name
And if I die for you
It won't be enough to satisfy
And as I break you
It won't be enough to pacify
And when I touch you
It won't be enough, just one more time
And when I f**k you
It won't be enough, it's never enough for me

Just like the web
I hold the gun
Waiting for a saviour
For a god that never comes
He never heard the screams cos
You're not the only one

Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you say you won't
Lie down and take it
Just lie
Lie down and take it
Don't you f*****g move
Lie down and take it

Nothing can stop what has begun (You cannot keep me away)
And you can't erase the damage done
And now you belong to me
Belong to me (x2)
