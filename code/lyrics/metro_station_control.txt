Song:

Another cigarette
And I'm so bored
Your words aren't making sense

I was taken
But you were waiting
One more drink
And I'm convinced

Not one more sound
Let your hair down
Take the low road
No one will know

Whoa, I feel just like we're taking control
Of the night, of the night [yea-yea]
Whoa, I feel just like we're losing control
But if you let go, I'll let go tonight

Another minute lived
If you take me
I'll take what you will give

I was late and
She kept waiting
But I hope she knows where I've been

Not one more sound
Let your hair down
Take the low road
No one will know

Whoa, I feel just like we're taking control
Of the night, of the night [yea-yea]
Whoa, I feel just like we're losing control
But if you let go, I'll let go tonight

I'm coming down
Bring me up
Take it off
Let's just touch (x4)

Whoa, I feel just like we're taking control
Of the night, of the night [yea-yea]
Whoa, I feel just like we're losing control
But if you let go, I'll let go tonight
