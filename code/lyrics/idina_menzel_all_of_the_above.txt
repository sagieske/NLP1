Song:

I am your s*** girl
I am your baby girl
I am your innocence
I am your mother
I'm lady chatterly
Or lady chastity
Or some anonymous lover

I can be your little virgin
(at the commack inn)
Or your dominatrix
(in your parent's bed)

We'll play some spin the bottle
We'll play some Marvin Gaye
Or we can dress you up in women's clothing

Let's go shopping at the Pink Pussycat
You talk to the salesmen
I'll hide in the back
I may be bashful, but...
I got the cash 'cause...
I ain't afraid to try new things like that

Whatever you're thinking
Whatever your feeling
I'll be either one or
All of the above

Whatever you're thinking
Whatever your feeling
I'll be either one or
All of the above

I'm a wido in mourning
(longing for your love)
I'm the bride on her wedding say
(and you are not the groom)
I'm a singing telegram at 2 am
Or the French maid who comes to clean your room

Let's go shopping at the Pink Pussycat
You talk to the salesmen
I'll hide in the back
I may be bashful, but...
I got the cash 'cause...
I ain't afraid to try new things like that

Whatever you're thinking
Whatever your feeling
I'll be either one or
All of the above

Whatever you're thinking
Whatever your feeling
I'll be either one or
All of the above

I'll keep you guessing, babe
You won't need confession, no
I'll be either one or
All of the above

Well I couldn't imagine
If I couldn't be myself
'cause if you're afraid to
Ask for what you want
Then you might rebel
But if you've got that combination
Where you can play some 'show and tell'
Well don't be shameful
I am your rainbow
Liberate your body and
Soothe your soul

I can be your babysitter
(who let you stay up late)
Or your best friend's mother
(really hot date)
Or you favorite cousin
(she taught you how to french kiss)
Or Miss Finigan from health class
I'm a school girl in knee socks
(with pig-tails in her hair)
I'm Aphrodite for dinner
(or Linda Carter)
I'm rose petals
I'm ruby wine
And if you want
I'l be the president's wife

Baby, won't you tell me...
Whatever you're thinking
Whatever you're feeling
I'll be either one or
All of the above...
