Chorus:
Sugar, coco and honey
Hey y'all bruno mars
That's why you taste like to me
And all I need is to s** to a shape down
Uh come it girl right now

That... On your... But let your body
You're my violin on a string
With every breath you take I wont' let em sting
So let me in open the doors
Or yours is mine or mine is yours
Where's your p**sy give me your pours
And now mine doing if you keep my...
Keep it clean 'cause we gettin in the mess
Baby go yeah you're baring in the flash
Aha for your friends that I'm better than your ex
And if you real that I'm better than your next
But... Pie you my sweet...
That's are the reasons that you're my sweet heart
So when I meet... Repeat fast
What are we just say take it slow so we...

Chorus:
Sugar, coco and honey
That's why you taste like to me
Now all I need is to s** to a shape down

Oh no oh no you... Ym tongue just like a coco
Oh no oh no I thin you need some cream upon you

Now all I need is to s** to a shape down
Uh come it girl right now

Sugar, coco and honey
That's why you taste like to me
Now all I need is to s** to a shape down
Uh come it girl right now
