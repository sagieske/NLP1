Song:

Uh
Let me get that
Let me get that, oooh
I get it when I get that, ooh
I spend it when I whip that

Flossin' on them haters
It’s that boss - the b***h, that caker
Trick's dad's born to tip that shaker
He's forfeiting all that paper
N****s coughing off that 8th of-
I want to hit them vapors
It’s that sporty b***h that game 'em
They calling me Super Sega, hit that

I’m just really out here livin'
Something like the new edition
They say I’m poison, what’s the difference?
Bbd, Michael Bivins

All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it

I’m just stunting in stilettos
Holla playa hello
All them dusty b*****s jello
I'm rising, I split that ghetto
It’s that time, look at that bezel
Dining with that cello
Freaky fine, a China fellow
He pumping banana yellow, get that

Let me get that, let me get that, oooh
Want to spit that, I'm a spit that, oooh
Want to hit that, let me hit that, oooh
I get it when they get that, oooh
I spend it when they spend that, oooh

I spend it when they get that, oooh
Fine, feminine, I whip that woop
Dram- drama and n****s get that deuce
Rambamalam flip that loot
Gam champ - her jiggy jam on loop
Damn, 'fam, what's your man gon' do?
I get it when whip that woop
I spend it when they spend that loot
Wilding with my b*****s
I be styling with my b*****s
Pretty eyes and long extensions - they smiling in all them pictures
I be rising with my b*****s
Riding with my b*****s
We the finest of them b*****s
We diamonds, it's diamond district
Get that ice, n***a, ice, n***a
B***h want to freeze like white winter
She need the G's, that price went up
She need to see that bright shimmer
He want to see that nice
Want to fit that slice, want to see that spice simmer
She want it with that white n***a
Peachy-pinky-piped n***a
Be's what it be's, little breeze by the sea -Az been about that life, n***a
T*** out with your wife, n***a
I'm bringing out the dyke in her
Xoxo fine, scissor sister, 69 whip that

I get it when I get that
I spend it when I whip that

Let me get that
Let me get that, oooh
When I spit that, I'm a spit that, oooh
When I hit that, let me hit that, oooh
I get it when I get that, oooh
I spend it when I spend that, oooh

I’m just really out here living
Something like a New Edition
They say I’m poison, what’s the difference?

All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
All my bad b*****s do it, bad b*****s do it
