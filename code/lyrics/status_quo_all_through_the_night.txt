Song:

( Lancaster / Rossi )

All through the night, oh, all through the night
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night

All alone again, I never get my way
I don't remember when it's never been the same
I know what I've been looking for
But now I know it's what I'm living for
I want you back again
I never get my way

All through the night, lonley day, lonley night
All through the day, lonely night, lonely day

Once upon a time I didn't really care
I loved so many times, but then I had my share
I got a feeling here inside
And now I know it's you that's on my mind
I want you back again
I never get my way

All through the night, lonley day, lonley night
All through the day, lonely night, lonely day
All through the night, oh, all through the night

Baby, baby, I just can't go on
Baby, waiting, what might come along
Baby, baby, I just hope that you know
Baby, holding, I won't let you go

All through the night, oh, all through the night
All through the night, oh, all through the night
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night
All through the day, lonely night, lonely day
All through the night, oh all through the night
