Song:

Release me

No remnants were ever found of it
Feeling the hot bile
With every fake smile
Though no evidence was ever found
It never went away completely

I try to run from the holy sound of it
Another day gone
Another night's drawn
Dark forces pull me underground
That never went away completely

How can I feel this empty?
I will not recover this time
This loneliness is killing me

Will I never know peace of mind again
I don't believe it
I can't achieve it
I think it all is just another sign that
It never went away completely

Terror is coursing in me
Dreading the final moment
When I have to dream
And feel you die
[Death inside of me, keeps a diligent watch on everything. Keeps a terrible hold on my belief. Just waiting for the moment when I...]
In Asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go, now it's dragging me
Into your grave
Your Asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me

Death's images are all around again
They're right behind me
They're going to find me
Judgement for the immortal sin
That have enveloped me completely

I know I'll never know a peaceful night again
Afraid they'll hear me
They don't fear me
Punishment for the immoral crime
The debt was never paid, completely

Terror is coursing in me
Dreading the final moment when I have to dream
And feel you die
(Death's inside of me, keeps a diligent watch on everything. Keeps a terrible hold on my belief, Just waiting for the moment when I...)
In Asylum (I live a lie)
Don't you know I'm in love with you
And I wasn't ready
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
To let go, now it's dragging me
Into your grave
Your Asylum (Forgive the lie)
Overcome by the feeling
That I will get to join you in time
For the loneliness is killing me

In the end there will be no suffering (More suffering)
In the end we will find out everything (Not anything)
In the end you may question your belief (What belief?)
In the end you will realize finally,
How you were decieved
This has gone on too long (Too long)
No more demonic dreams
Destroyer, come tonight
Because her memory is killing me

In Asylum (I live a lie)
I let go, now it's dragging me
Into your grave
For Asylum (Relive a lie)
Overcome by the feeling that
I will get to join you in time (Without you)
This world is not fulfilling me

Don't think I live in Asylum
I live a lie
Don't want to live in Asylum
I'll live a lie
Don't think I live in Asylum
I am a lie
