Song:

Hey Yeah Hmmmm

Well it's been four lonely days and three lonely nights
Looking for my baby but she's nowhere in sight
See I've traveled far and wide
Seen the finest places
What does it all amount to, when there's no familiar faces

[Chorus:]
See I've been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I don't know where she can be
Been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
And I can't even find myself

Hey Yeah
Oh oh

Well I don't know where I am
And I don't know who I'm with
All I'm hanging on to is that loving that you give
You see I've lost my sense of time
And I got no direction
Sending out a signal
Been trying to get your attention

[Chorus:]
See I've been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I don't know where she can be
Been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I can't even find myself

Hey you know what I'm talking about
I ain't the only one who's feeling down and out

No, there's no spaces they clutter up my mind
Those wonderful traces
Suddenly there's no place I can find
My lover my lover
My lover my lover

Yeah yeah ohh

See I've been around the world and I
I can't find my - my lover my lover
Been around
I can't even find myself

[Chorus:]
See I've been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I don't know where she can be
Been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I don't know where she can be

See I've been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I don't know where she can be
Been around the world and I
I can't find my lover
Been around the world and I
I can't even find myself

Well it's been four lonely days and three lonely nights
Looking for my baby but she's nowhere in sight
