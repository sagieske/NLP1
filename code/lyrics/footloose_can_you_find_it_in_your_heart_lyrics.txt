Song:

Can you find it iin your heart, to forgive her?
Can you stop and see there's part of her that's trying to obey?
While part of her is dying to run away?
Can you hear what she's trying to say?
Can you find it in your soul, to accept her?
If she stumbles on your holy path do you have to repremand?
Or are there ways to make her understand?
With out using tha back of your hand?
Can't you remmeber, when we were that age?
Pumped up with promise and wrestling with rage?
Can't you remmeber, when we were a family back when?
Could we be one, again?

Does it ever cross you mind that I miss you?
Is there any chance we'll find the joy that we shared at the start?
Can you remmeber what you felt?
Before that feeling fell apart?
Can you find it in your hear?
Have you lost my love?
Somewhere far behind?
Or can you find it in your heart?
