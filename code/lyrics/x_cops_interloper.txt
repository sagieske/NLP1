Song:

X-Cops patrol your streets tonight
And we will judge what's wrong or right

And if you interfere
With what we're doing here
It's your unlucky day
We'll blow your a** away

We are the law
We are justice
You pay our wages
And so you trust us

But if you f**k around
Then you'll be goin down
We'll beat you to your knees
You are the enemy
Because we wear a shield
We have the right to kill
And if the guiltless die
We turn a blind eye

We turn a blind eye
We turn a blind eye
We turn a blind eye

Blind Eye
