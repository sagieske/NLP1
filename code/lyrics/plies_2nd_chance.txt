Song:

I went to see my n***a, he doin' seventeen
One of the realist n****s, I done ever seen
Got caught wit' a bird, but his record was clean
Comin' back from Dade, on da Gator wit' speed
He a real soldier, but his partner was greed
Get out when he fourty, went in at twenty-three
How seventeen years worth one key
Some s**t cost twenty-grand can get you over ten piece
He ain't wanna hurt nobody, he was just tryna eat
He had a real job, went to work four days a week
Said this his last trip, and he was gettin' out the streets
He a good n***a, second chance all he need

[Hook-2x]
Some n****s make mistakes, off f****d up circumstance
Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen
They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands
I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance

[Verse 2:]
Wish I had one chance, to sentence the Judge kids
And watch 'em beg for they life like my n****s did
Give them a life sentence fo' some s**t that wasn't big
'Fore they get granted they appeal they gotta do ten
Shoe gotta be on the otha foot for you to understand
The scariest s**t in the world to be a black man
What my future holds, wish I knew in advance
I approach life everyday just hopin' I win
A lot us already lost, we sittin' in the pen
This s**t crazy 'cause God, he forgive sin
But when it come to the system that s**t don't bend
I guess it do, dependin' on the color of yo' skin

[Hook-2x]
Some n****s make mistakes, off f****d up circumstance
Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen
They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands
I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance

[Verse 3:]
I thought it was understood, nobody was perfect
So, how can one mistake make yo' life worthless
God made us all, put us here to serve a purpose
Yo life in twelve strangers hands to come back with a verdict
But is that really fair, what if they all was dirty
You mess up one time, and they come back with thirty
But if you ain't got money, yo whole family hurtin'
Then you ain't got a choice, you gotta cop out early
But if you was rich, you wouldn'ta got them thirty
What if the Judge racist, nobody'd overturn it
The system f****d up, because it ain't sturdy
Welcome to America, home of the controversy

[Hook-2x]
Some n****s make mistakes, off f****d up circumstance
Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen
They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands
I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance
