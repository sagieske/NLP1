Song:

Son, she said, have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was only just a
While you were sleepin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'

Sorry you didn't see him,
But I'm glad we talked

[Chorus:]
Oh I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey

Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She says I'm ready
I can't remember anything to this very day
Except the look, the look

Oh, you know where, now I can't see, I just stare

[Repeat Chorus]

Is something wrong, she said
Well of course there is
You're still alive, she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be
Is that the question
And if so, if so, if so, who answers

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm still alive
