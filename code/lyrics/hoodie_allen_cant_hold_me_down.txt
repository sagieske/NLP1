[Intro:]
You know, in the run in the anyways man, I'm turning it up
Hot diggity-dang
Thank you, thank you for rocking out tonight
You could be anywhere in the world
But you right here
I got my special guest, Tayyib Ali man,
We bringing this souly from the key-stone state.
Chilling in the empire state
'Till we run the entire state.

(Verse 1 - Hoodie Allen)
Sitting in my '97 Honda, Yolanda
Be cool, she just want to go to Benihana.
These fools rocking in my mother f*****g spot
Got a little bit of nerve and a lot a bit of pot
I can smell it while she hanging out the passenger side
Of her best friends ride and she's just trying to holla at me
Knows how to fight, punched her in the left eye
Chicks be getting fiesty 'cause they fighting for the best guy.
Yeah I'm bumping Biggie but I've never been to Bedstock.
Counting out my money in a shoebox by my bedside.
That's oldschool, no city bank
Got another girl all she listens to is Chiddy Bang.
Everyone around me keep complaining that the city change,
Listening to serious radio with the silly face.
All these b*****s hatin' yeah I oughta name them Will n' Grace
Gotta fat chance, I can fill the space.

[Chorus:]
I said please miss, I don't believe it
You touched me once I could feel it,
Ain't no way that I'd ever leave it
We could float way up to the cieling
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me.
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, can't hold me down.

(Verse 2 - Tayyib Ali)
Young boss man, they ain't heard of me though
Off top the convertable flow, and everywhere that I go
I seem to need you, so you know Imma do anything I need to.
Hold up.
They say I changed, picture that with a polaroid.
We in the fast lane, you hear the motor roarin'
I had to pop-shove-it, 'cause you went overboard.
I left Charlette still bonging like I'm open for it.
And they know they can't hold me down,
Hoodie we on top this door roun'
It's hard to holla' at you, 'cause I'm outta' town.
In the sky, but they manufacture me from the ground.
Nineteen with the dream of having it all,
I need big money, so I'm stacking it all,
You be my main girl, and I can be your dog
You'd be here when I'm up, just be down when I fall.

[Chorus:]
I said please miss, I don't believe it
You touched me once I could feel it,
Ain't no way that I'd ever leave it
We could float way up to the cieling
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me.
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, can't hold me down.

(Verse 3 - Hoodie Allen)
Nowadays the phone don't ring
Texts don't blow up
Heads so big that my neck won't show up.
But, I'm up and at 'em, keep on moving on the deal
Got a super bad brode but she doing Jonah Hill
And my suit is half off and my ties all knoted.
These hippies really love me 'cause my buzz organic
They pick me at the market stick their pitchforks on it
Then they stick me in the garbage like the shit's gone rotting
Man I'm sick to my stomach so I guess I'm Johnny Appleseed
One sapling the way I go and tackle bees,
Who would go and tackle Beta, fishing for these compliments
You Mickey D's with condiments
I'm Licky Lee with confidence
That's got me on these continents, I'm on to the next place
Got a little love, I don't even need a s** tape
Gotta' live it up, I don't even need an X-Ray
They see through all that bull homie, exnay

[Outro:]
I said please miss, I don't believe it
You touched me once I could feel it,
Ain't no way that I'd ever leave it
We could float way up to the cieling
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me.
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, can't hold me down.

I said please miss, I don't believe it
You touched me once I could feel it,
Ain't no way that I'd ever leave it
We could float way up to the cieling
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me.
They can't hold me down, they can't hold me,
They can't hold me down, can't hold me down.
