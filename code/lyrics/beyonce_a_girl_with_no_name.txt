Song:

You don't care about me at all
You treat me like dirt all the time
What do I have to do
Oh baby your not my boo

Chorus:
Cause you treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if it'll be the same
Why can't you call me Beyonce
Or is it that your not happy
Cause I'm a girl with no name

Why are we together and we don't talk to each other
Why do you call me baby
I told you my name is beyonce
So that's all I have to say

Chorus:
You treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if you'll be the same
Will you love me for ever for life
Will you ask me to be your wife 2x cause

I'm just a girl with no name
A girl with no name

So baby! 
Call me by my name please! 
I wonder if you want to be
My... 
Baby boo

You treat me like a girl with no name
I wonder if you'll be the same
I try so hard to let it go
But you made me wanna go home
Cause I'm just a girl with no name
Cause I'm just a girl with no name
I'm just a girl
With no name
(She's just a girl with no name)
It's over
