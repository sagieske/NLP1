Song:

Ever since I was a little bitty baby all I ever wanted was love
You thought that I needed a lot more maybe
But all I ever needed was love
The memories of my childhood I recall
As the very most favorite times of all
Was sittin' and rockin' on my daddy's knee
Or when my mother made a new dress for me
Or when my dear old grandpaw sung with me
Or when my grandmaw baked a berry pie for me
Or when a boyfriend chased me up a tree
Think it over baby maybe then you'll see
Ever since I was a little bitty baby
All I ever wanted was love, love, love, love
All I ever wanted was love.

--- Instrumental ---

When you walked into my life you told me
That all you could give me was love
Remember how I laughed and I cried
And told you all I ever wanted was love
I don't know why you thought I needed wealth and fame
I promise I was happy just sharin' your name
But soon you bought a great big house for me
Every other room had a color tv
You hired a cook to bake our daily bread
You even had another woman makin' our bed
Material possessions didn't matter to me baby
I'm so sorry you couldn't see
Ever since I was a little bitty baby
All I ever wanted was love, love, love, love
All I ever wanted was love...
