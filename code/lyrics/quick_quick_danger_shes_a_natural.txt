Song:

So I arrive in time, my friends they fill me in
I can't escape it when she rocks that 10
The way it looks I think a fight is fair
I'm in way over my head but then I just don't care

And when you take it to the floor you know, you know
That you could only do some more I know, I know
So if you wanna lose control let's go, let's go
Your move, your call I think we just feel right

I'm not gonna lie I need a girl tonight
And you're looking so fly you got me you got me
My emotions run high when all I think about is you
Girl you're a natural, yeah you're a natural

It's a game and it's tactical
The way she plays she's a natural
Gotta get the timing right
Don't say don't stop tonight
There's a handful of words I, I hang onto

And when you take it to the floor you know, you know
That you could only do some more I know, I know
So if you wanna lose control let's go, let's go
Then we can finally be alone

My intentions are real
So hypnotic you feel
I got something special just for you
So connected we seal
My reaction to you
Should spell out exactly the way I feel
