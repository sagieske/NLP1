Song:

All shut up! Don't break the silence!
The sleep of angels prevents violence
Blades of angels will protect
Golden billion will dominate

Sleep sleep sleep
My fading world
Handmade angels keep us all
Dissipate
Your mad mad life
Angels still are on our side

Pray for peace - prepare for war
The base of human life is these words
Will to live
Will to survive
Will to rule and to divide

Stop right now
Reflect about
What you ll lose when last war start?
Work and house
Your credit noose
Think sometimes: what do they lose?

Angels of silence
Freedom and calm
Angels of justice
Fly one by one

Keep the silence, cold steel Angels
From second sunrise of innocence
Save from pain and torture, Angels
Keep the peace for human race

5 4 3 2 1 Start the Angels

Angels of silence
Bringers of peace
Angels of justice
World is on it's knees
