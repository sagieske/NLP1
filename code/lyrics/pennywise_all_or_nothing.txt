Song:

What's the f*****g problem with this world today you've become what they
Wanted and now your numb, when will you stand up and say. We're living in
Decisions of the feeble minds, the limits are intended and imposed by time,
A poison disease called complacency has taken control of our lives.

[Chorus:] We'll never know until we try the time is now it's all or nothing,
We are alive it's do or die we must believe it's all or nothing now.

Why don't you take a look around you. The answers lie in your mind, it's up
To each and everyone of us until the day that we die. That we only need to
Motivate and realize alleviate the censure and you'll redefine defeat the
Disease so you can break free from the struggles you hold deep inside.

[Chorus:]

We will never know unless we really try, you will never see that there's so
Much to life, I've stood confused but now I'm open eyed, we're never gonna
Slow down, I believe that we can move on conquer our goals and right what
Is wrong, I believe that we can stay true true to ourselves and find
Something new, find something new
