Song:

It's aginst th' law to walk, It's aginst th' law to talk
It's against th' law to loaf, It's aginst th' law to work
It's aginst th' law to read, It's aginst th' law to write
It's aginst th' law to be a black or brown or white.

Ever'thing's aginst th' law
I'm a low pay daddy singing th' high price blues

It's aginst th' law to eat, It's aginst th' law to drink
It's aginst th' law to worry, It's aginst th' law to think
It's aginst th' law to marry or to try to settle down
It's aginst th' law to ramble like a bum from town to town

Ever'thing's aginst th' law
I'm a low pay daddy singing th' high price blues

It's aginst th' law to come, It's against th' law to go
It's against th' law to ride, It's against th' law to roll
It's aginst th' law to hug, It's against th' law to kiss
It's against th' law to shoot, It's against th' law to miss

Ever'thing's aginst th' law
I'm a low pay daddy singing th' high price blues

It's aginst th' law to gamble, It's aginst th' law to roam
It's aginst th' law to organize or try to build a home
It's aginst th' law to sing, It's aginst th' law to dance
It's aginst th' law to tell you th' trouble on my hands

Ever'thing in Winston Salem is aginst th' law
I'ma low pay daddy singin' th' high price blues.
