Song:

Black and white and overly dramatic
All the colored lights give the people headaches
Never could keep inside the lines
I think there's symbolism there
I never was good with goodbyes
That's how I ended up here
Half grown up and full of doubt
Like poetry never read and rarely thought about

[Chorus:]
Think about the days
When everything wasn't the same
And we appreciated snow that fell
And ourselves as much as someone else
It may be a long time gone,
But as long as we go on..
I'll remember crayon-scrawled cards
Pasted with all cut out hearts

Black and white and overly dramatic
All the colored lights give the people headaches
Pulling eyelashes just to wish on them
For something fast and maybe something beyond that

[Chorus:]
