Song:

What on earth am I missing
What is it that I don't see
Is their someone somewhere out there
Crying out

Am I truly not noticing
Or just refusing to believe
Do I choose to feed my faithless self
With doubt

All of heaven is falling all around me
And I am drowning in the mystery of Your love
All the universe can't contain Your beauty
But You come alive in me
You come alive

I'm not flying on angel wings
I'm not swinging from no tree
I got love and hate and the will to change
And choose

I have a smile that You gave me
You have a love that I need
When I'm down, You know just how
To lift my mood

You bring me to life
Yeah it feels just like
I've been born again
