Song:

Let's stay a while and watch him
He's moving into action man
He's looking good but maybe
He's in the wrong direction man
But he wanna get a little, get a little
Every night, get a little, get a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs to have a recreation
Everybody needs a little comfort for the soul
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in 'em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you
He's cruising with the singles
Down the margarita bar
He's boring to distraction
Pushing words and talking stars
(What's your sign)
He's gotta take a little, take a little
On the side, make a little, make a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs a little lubrication
Someone with imagination got to break the ice
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a lover without rhythm
Don't blow your horn if you ain't true
No point in playing Valentino
He's a sham and brother so are you
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in 'em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you
