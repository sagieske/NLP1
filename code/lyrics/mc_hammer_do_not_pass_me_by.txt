I JUST don't IT TO PASS ME BY

PASS ME NOT OH GENTLE SAVIOUR
HEAR MY HUMBLE CRY
WHILE ON OTHERS THOU ARE CALLING
DO NOT PASS ME BY
DO NOT PASS ME BY

THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE WAY THAT TOU HOLD ME MAKE ME YOU SHAKE ME YOU TAKE ME THAN YOU MOLD ME
BUT IN MY HÉART IN MY SOUL AND IN MY SPIRIT
THE LOVE OF GOD EVERY DAY l'VE GOTTA BE NEAR IT
HE TOOK ME TO THE WATER I WENT DOWN IN YOUR NAME
I REPENTED ALL MY SINS
I HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME
MY KNEES STARTED SHAKING
MY LEGS HAD TO RUN
HIS LOVE TOUCHED MY HEART
AND HIS SPIRIT LlFTED MY TONGUE
LlFTED MY TONGUE
I LOVE THE LORD UNTILL THE DAY THAT I DIE SO PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! DON'T PASS ME BY SING!

WHILE ON OTHERS THOU ARE CALLING
DO NOT PASS ME BY
DO NOT PASS ME BY

I'VE GOT THE FEELlNG BUT THE FEELlNG'S NOT THE SAME
I DID A LlTTLE HIP HOP THA HÀMMER AND THE JAM
BUT A TOUCH, A TOUCH FROM UP ABOVE
AND l'VE GOT THE FEELlNG THE FEELlNG OF YOUR LOVE REACHIN' OUT - REACHIN' OUT!
AND CALLIN' FOR SOME PEOPLE
WHO KEEP US ALL SAFE FROM THIS WORLD THAT'S FULL OF EVIL TRYING! TRYING!
LORD SOME TIMES l'M CRYING
THE SON GIVE HIS LlFE, THE PEOPLE ARE STILL DENYING
WHEN I THINK OF THE GOODNESS AND WHAT HE'S DONE FOR ME MY SOUL CRIES HALLELUJAH!
THANKS FOR SAVING ME!SING!

WHILE ON OTHERS THOU ARE CALLING
DO NOT PASS ME BY
