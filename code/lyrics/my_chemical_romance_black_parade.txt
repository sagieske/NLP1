Song:

When I was
A young boy,
My father
Took me into the city
To see a marching band.
He said,
"Son when
You grow up,
Would you be
The savior of the broken,
The beaten and the damned? "
He said
"Will you
Defeat them,
You demons,
And all the non believers,
The plans that they have made?
Because one day
I'll leave you,
A phantom
To lead you in the summer,
To join the black parade. "

Sometimes I get the feeling, she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
Went through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone we want you all to know

We'll carry on, We'll carry on
And though you're all dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A woman sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on

We'll carry on,
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on we carry through the fears
Oh oh oh

Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh oh oh
Take a look at me 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Come and try; you'll never break me
We want it all, we want to play this part
I won't explain, or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer, for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero
Just a boy, whose meant to sing this song
I'm just a man; I'm not a hero
I
Don't
Care!

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Come and try; you'll never break me
We want it all, we want to play this part
Do or die
You'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try; you'll never break me
We want it all, we want to play this part
We'll carry on
