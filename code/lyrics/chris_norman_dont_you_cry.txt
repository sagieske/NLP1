Song:

Every day I think of you.
And come what may, you're on my mind.
Time goes by oh we can't stop it.
Don't be sad we had our time.
And thought we tried it's not to be.
So baby smile when you think of me.

Chorus: Don't you cry, baby it's not so bad.
Don't ask why baby don't look so sad.
Cause you'll look back one day and think of what
We had.
So don't you Cry.

Life is just a stupid game.
So put your trust in what you see.
I wish you well in all you do.
And you'll be fine eventually.
Lift up your heart and fly away.
There'll always be a better day.

Chorus: Don't'you cry, baby it's not bad.

Don't ask why, baby don't look so sad.
Cause you'll look back one day and think of what we had.
So don't you cry.

Any time you need me know where I am.
All you have to do is call.
If ever you're in trouble I'll be there for you.
Baby any time at all.

And if one day we meed again.
And if I try a new romance.
Turn around don't hesitate.
Cause we won't get a second chance.
I know we tried to get along.
No turning back no right or wrong.

Chorus: Don't your cry, baby it's not so bad.
Don't ask why, baby don't look so sad.
Cause you'll look back one day and think of what
We had. So don't you cry.
