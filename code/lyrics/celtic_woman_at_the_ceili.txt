Song:

All:
Tonight we're going to meet some lads
Us girls are dressed up gaily
We'll all be dancing 'til the dawn
We're going to the ceili

The lads they come from miles around
From Ennis and Kilmaley
To show us all their fancy steps
We're going to the ceili

They're playing tunes on everything
From pipes to ukulele
It sounds so good you can't sit down
We're dancing at the ceili

Lisa:
All the boys we loved so well
So handsome young and charming
They're in New York and Boston now
They should be home here farming
My own true love has sailed away
To be an endless rover
Cause times are tough and he must leave
To start a new life over

He writes me letters every week
To say how much he's slaving
And he promises that he'll be back
Before the hay needs saving
But it's hard to love somebody
That you're not in touch with daily
So I'm looking for somebody new
Tonight down at the ceili

The winter nights are long and hard
And time goes by so slowly
I wish my true lover he was here
And in his arms I'd roll
He'd whisper tender words of love to me
And kiss my lips so sweetly
And quickly I'd surrender to his manly charms completely

All:
He writes me letters every week
To say how much he's slavin'
And he promises that he'll be back
Before the hay needs savin'
But it's hard to love somebody
That you're not in touch with daily
So I'm looking for somebody new
Tonight down At The Ceili
So I'm looking for somebody new
Tonight down At The Ceili

Orla:
I hope I meet someone tonight
Who'll make my heart beat fast
A handsome man with laughing eyes
Who smiles as he walks past
And when they play an old-time waltz,
He'll twirl me round the floor
He'll promise me that I will be
His girl forevermore
His girl forevermore
His girl forevermore
He'll promise me that I will be
His girl forevermore

Meav:
I'm somewhat in a bother
That is really quite alarming
I have two lads pursuing me
And each of them is charming
One of them is dark and poor
One fair with lots of money
I don't know which one to choose
The flowered or the honey

What on earth am I to do
It's driving me half crazy
Tonight I'll make my mind up
When I see them At The Ceili

To be a poor man's wife will be
A life of washing dishes
When a rich man's wife will surely have
Great luxury and riches

In comfort how I know
It wouldn't be too hard to wallow
But being poor is not much fun
Which one should I follow?

All:
What on earth am I to do
It's driving me half crazy
Tonight I'll make my mind up
When I see them At The Ceili

Lisa:
I've been lucky I've found a lad who's handsome and a neighbor

Orla:
And me I've met a decent man who's friendship I will savor

Meav:
And me I've made my choice as well and in no way was it easy
But I'd rather have a man for love
Then to be a rich man's lady

All:
And that is how the story ends
May true love never fail me
We got ourselves three men tonight
And we met them at the ceili!
