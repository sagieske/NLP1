Song:

All the love of the universe

Oo, oo, do...
New thoughts
Will purify my mind
And clean my body
New lives
Will fall together like an endless story

All the love of the universe
Will be shared by all that's living

And I don't really care
About tomorrow
Today
Is all I really need to find the answers

Ill find the constant flow
Of all the harmony

Everybody needs a helpin hand
Everybody needs a helpin hand
