Song:

Yes it's true for most of my life I spoke devil
And I did my best to dodge anything that looked at all like work
I was prone to standing on corners smokin' cigarettes
And talkin' about anything I didn't know
Oh, how I needed to go

Please take me to the land of milk and honey
To the land of love and sunshine
To the land of milk and honey, Please take me

Time passed and I got a little older
Takin' on trouble just a little bit harder and a little bit bolder
I was thinkin' colder, fightin', lyin', cheatin' & cryin', I gave up
Givin'-up the voices of evil that were pullin' me down
You know, I was givin' up ground

Please take me to the land of milk and honey
To the land of love and sunshine
To the land of milk and honey, Please take me

Then it came and it sounded like thunder
Shot of light in the dark of the night and you were really there
Tellin' me that you care, your warm love took away the cold
And were you walked the cobblestones turned to gold
And when you touch my hair you know take me there

Please take me to the land of milk and honey
To the land of love and sunshine
To the land of milk and honey, Please take me
