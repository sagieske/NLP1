Song:

Underneath my skin is it just anger, just frustration?
Underneath my skin is it decisions or these feelings?
It always hurt my mind (it always hurt my mind)
It always killed my pride inside.
It always wastes my time
Again, again...

Again I bleed, again I shake.
Again I fall, again I break.
Wasted, hated.
Again, again...

Underneath my skin is it just anger, just frustration?
Underneath my skin is it just nothing, or these feelings?
'Cause all I find just fades. (all I find just fades)
No, I don't feel what I felt before.
I'm back inside this cage.
Again, again...

Again I bleed, again I shake.
Again I fall, again I break.
Wasted, hated.
Again, again...

Again I burn, take it all.
Inside my head, I hate the world,
Because I don't know (don't know)
I let go
Again, again...

Underneath my skin is it just anger, just frustration?
Underneath my skin is it just nothing, or these feelings?
'Cause all of mine just fades.
Again, again...

Again I bleed, again I shake.
Again I fall, again I break.
Wasted, hated.
Again, again...

Again I burn, and take it all.
But inside my head, I hate the world,
Because I don't know (don't know)
I let go.
Again, again...

Again.
Again.
Again.
Again
