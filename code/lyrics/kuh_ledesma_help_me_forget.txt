Song:

Help me forget, help me forget
The one I love so much
We have to say goodbye
It’s just no good to try
But we both know deep inside

We cannot get along
We both tried to be strong
But everything went wrong
Maybe we don’t belong
Help me to forget, I tried so hard and yet
It’s just hard to forget

We cannot get along
We both tried to be strong
But everything went wrong
Maybe we don’t belong
Help me to forget, I tried so hard and yet
It’s just hard to forget

We cannot get along
We both tried to be strong
But everything went wrong
Maybe we don’t belong
Help me to forget, I tried so hard and yet
It’s just hard to forget
