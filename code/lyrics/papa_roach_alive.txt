Song:

For crying out loud
i'm running from a comedown
god forbid i know i've been a letdown
reaching for the sky while laying in a gutter
kicking and screaming i am singing bloody murder

I'm Alive when i'm vulnerable
i'm out of control i'm losing my soul

I can't be your angel
when i'm living like a devil
Can't be your lover
when i'm living like a rebel
dont want your pity &
dont want your help
dont try & save me
go take care of yourself

I'm alive

Sick of the pain
i'm sick of the sorrow
sick of today
i'm sick of tomorrow
i'm addicted to
the misery in my head
i better stop before i end up dead

so i climb to the top
just to fall to the bottom
and i climb up to the top
just to fall to the bottom
