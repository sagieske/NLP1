Song:

I want you to love me, but I don't think you will.
I wander around as I repeat this to myself
It's the only answer I have, even if I'm scared of getting hurt.
I'll say "I love you" to the one I love
Do you love me or not?
I don't care what the answer is, I just need to know!

No matter how badly I desire to be with you.

There are many unchangable things in this world, and my love for you, can't be stopped by anyone

As 1000 nights pass, I love to tell you...
I have to let you know.
"I want you to love me, but I don't think you will."
I wander around as I repeat myself
It's the only answer I have, even if I'm scared of getting hurt.


I'll say "I love you" to the one I love
Putting these feelings into words is so scary, but I'll say "I love you" to the one I love.
The happiness we chance upon in our lives can't be expressed in words.

That's why we can only smile, why we sing "Do Re Mi" among vivid autumn colors, with winter at our backs, and the spring sunbeams peeking through the leaves, as to protect someone who's just been reborn.

As I looked at the road I'd travelled and the path ahead, my eyes were filled with cowardice

I wanted to look into your eyes, but was afraid I wouldn't be honest. I didn't want to know that you didn't love me, and live the rest of my days all alone.

That day, I kept on loving you without getting hurt

As 1000 nights pass, I love to tell you... I have to let you know,
"I want you to love me, but I don't think you will."
I wander around as I repeat myself
It's the only answer I have, even if I'm scared of getting hurt.
I'll say "I love you" to the one I love. Even if my feelings aren't returned, I can say "I love you" to the one I love... And that's the most beautiful thing in the world.
