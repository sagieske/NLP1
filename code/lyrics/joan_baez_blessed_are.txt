Song:

(Words and Music by Joan Baez)

Blessed are the one way ticket holders
On a one way street.
Blessed are the midnight riders
For in the shadow of God they sleep.
Blessed are the huddled hikers
Staring out at falling rain,
Wondering at the retribution
In their personal acquaintance with pain.
Blessed are the blood relations
Of the young ones who have died,
Who had not the time or patience
To carry on this earthly ride.
Rain will come and winds will blow,
Wild deer die in the mountain snow.
Birds will beat at heaven's wall,
What comes to one must come to us all.

For you and I are one way ticket holders
On a one way street.
Which lies across a golden valley
Where the waters of joy and hope run deep.
So if you pass the parents weeping
Of the young ones who have died,
Take them to your warmth and keeping
For blessed are the tears they cried
And many were the years they tried.
Take them to that valley wide
And let their souls be pacified.
