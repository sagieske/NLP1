Song:

I've got a lot of things
I have to do
All these distractions
Our future's coming soon

We're being pulled
A hundred different directions
But whatever happens
I know I've got you

You're on my mind
You're in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright
Even if we're miles apart

All I wanna do
Is be with you
Be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart
You know it's true

I just wanna be with you

You know how life can be
It changes overnight
It's sunny then raining
But it's all right

A friend like you
Always makes it easy
I know that you get me
Every time

Through every up
Through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything
You can count on me

All I wanna do
Is be with you
Be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart
You know it's true

I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
