INTRO:(TREACH from NBN talking)
Check it out.Yeah yeah yeah
Naughty up in here(That's why I love you baby)
Time to bring the ruckus with rap
From the beginning till we're out(That's why I love you baby)
Introducing Miss Thing Monica
That's right representing ATL to Illtown(That's why I love you baby)
Everybody get up out of your seats and fix your body
For ain't nobody(That's why i love you baby)
It goes like this!

VERSE 1:(MONICA)
You've been more than good to me
Give me all that I could need
There's a little thing you do,baby
Never fight in front of your friends
Take me ridin in your Benz
Spending time,let me know that I'm on your mind,baby

Because everytime I say "I love you" it's with a pride
And everytime I say "I need you" it's from inside
Because my heart is forever,the things you do
You do just for me,that's why I love you baby

CHORUS
Ain't nobody gonna love you like I do
Ain't nobody gonna treat you the way I treat you(That's why I love you
Baby)
Ain't nobody ever loved me like you do
Ain't nobody to compare to you
That's why I love you baby

VERSE 2
(TREACH)
You think your lucky caught a quicky in a nap
A hicky on your lap
That's the payback for the scratches you left on my back
You wouldn't need a toy-friend with a boyfriend
Or somethin proper if you slept under the thunder
Keep my number I heard your next best is now ya next ex
'Cause in the middle what a best sex "Hey yo Treach"
An' I ain't mad at'cha yet
What'cha pimp daddy don't know won't hurt him.
Who loves ya best?

(MONICA)
Treat me like your young lady
Special things you say to me
Feels so good to be with you my baby
Doesn't matter what they think
'Cause I'm gonna be here anyway
There's no need to feel ashamed because you're on my mind

And everytime I say "I love you" it's with a pride
And everytime i say "I need you" it's from inside
Because my heart is forever,the things you do
You do just for me,that's why I love you baby

CHORUS x 2

That's why I love you baby

VERSE 3:(TREACH)
I kinda wanna turn ya Poverty to Paradise
You say ya lonely,keep ya head up,honey where ya eyes?
We can keep it on a low-down-down,I don't go down,I throw down
He threw your clothes over the Rover,so where you gonna go now?
Remember when I was like "Who you?",now you my boo-boo
He be braggin how he do you,so who you think he true to?
Sue-Sue and you to,huh,Chi-Chi and Gigi
Tellin' you he need you plus his baby momma need me
But I'm gonna get betwenn the love of this,I'll let him my keys
Cry in my arms so you cry no more at last
Feed ya body,I'll drive ya rush Audi
So trust me hottie like there ain't nobody
(That's why I love you baby)

CHORUS TO FADE
