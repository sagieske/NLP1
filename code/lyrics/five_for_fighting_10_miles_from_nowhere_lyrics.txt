Song:

How have you been
In the shape you were in
I'm surprised that you got where you're going

Who would believe
What a date you would be
If I knew I'd have thought about knowing

And in between now and the last time we met
I'd open the door if I met you again
And I swear that we'd be better/fair ever friends
From here until 10 miles from nowhere

What is that there
In your brown paper box
I can see that you kept all the memories we'd lost

I'd sworn it was you
Who was destined and gone
To the pressure of past undertakings

Had I had known that it might have been me
I might have returned a letter or three
Or gave you a call from the sanctuary

For the cracks in these walls tell time for a fee

From here until 10...
From now until 10... Miles from nowhere
