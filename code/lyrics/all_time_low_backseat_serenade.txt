Song:

Lazy lover, find a place for me again
You felt it once before, I know you did,
I could see it
Whiskey princess, drink me under, pull me in
You had me at "Come over, boy,
I need a friend, " I understand.

Backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away, to your radio
Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away, to your radio

You take me over,
I throw you up against the wall
We've seen it all before,
But this was different, it's deliberate
You send me reeling,
Calling out to you for more
The value of this moment lives in metaphor
Yeah, through it all,

Backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away, to your radio
Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away, to your radio

Backseat serenade, dizzy hurricane
Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the sweat away, to your radio
Backseat serenade, little hand grenade
Oh, aren't you sick of sleeping alone?
You're salty like a summer day
Kiss the pain away, to your radio

Oh, God, I'm sick of sleeping alone
