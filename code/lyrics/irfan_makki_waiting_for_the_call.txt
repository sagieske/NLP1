Song:

Miles away, oceans apart
Never in my sight, but always in my heart
The love is always there, it will never die
Only growing stronger, a tear rolls down my eye

I'm thinking all the time
When the day will come
Standing there before you
Accept this Hajj of mine

Standing in ihram, making my tawaf
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan

O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall

I feel alive and I feel strong
I can feel Islam running through my veins
To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name
I truly hope one day, everyone will get the chance 
To be blessed with the greatest honour
Of being called to Your Noble House

Standing in ihram making my tawaf, 
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan

O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall

Labbayka Allahumma labbayk (here I am, O Allah, here I am)
Labbayka la sharika laka labbayk (here I am, You have no partner. Here I am)
Innal hamda wanni'mata laka wal mulk (surely all praise, grace and dominion is Yours)
La sharika laka labbayk (No partner have You, here I am)

Labbayka Allahumma labbayk (here I am, O Allah, here I am)
Labbayka la sharika laka labbayk (here I am, You have no partner. Here I am)
Innal hamda wanni'mata laka wal mulk (surely all praise, grace and dominion is Yours)
La sharika laka labbayk (No partner have You, here I am)
Labbayk(here I am)
Labbayk(here I am)

O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall

O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
