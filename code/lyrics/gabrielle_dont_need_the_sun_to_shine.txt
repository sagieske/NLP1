Song:

It's been a while
But your smile
Always brightens up my day
I guess you know
Because it shows
You can see it on my face

Feels like you putt a spell on me
Feels like you captured me
And baby, this is how I feel

Don't need the sun to shine
To make me smile
Don't care if it's dark outside
Cause I got you
And though the rain may fall
No, I won't care at all
Cause baby, I know that I got you

Every day
There's a change
You bring out the best in me
My inner soul
Is what you know
That is how you speak to me

You seem to understand
You know just who I am
And baby, this is how I feel

Don't need the sun to shine
To make me smile
Don't care if it's dark outside
Cause I got you
And though the rain may fall
No, I won't care at all
Cause baby, I know that I got you

Don't need a rocket man to help me touch the sky
Don't need to fly a plane to get this high
Don't need to hitch a ride
When I could run a million miles
Yes, I would, just to see you smile

Don't need the sun to shine
To make me smile
Don't care if it's dark outside
Cause I got you
And though the rain may fall
No, I won't care at all
Cause baby, I know that I got you

I got you, baby, and it feels right
You got me feeling so good and so bright
Feel like I could touch the sky
So good inside
