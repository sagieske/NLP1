Song:

Boyfriends a few instructions in the song.

[?]
Give a girl some credit
I'm gonna keep on loving you
‘cause you be the realest, all day and all night
And that's how you stay by my side
[?]
It doesn't matter, 'cause nobody's perfect here, no.
If you leaving, I can make you stay

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby? (2x)

Sit yourself down, ‘cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense,
‘Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

You do you all day [?]
Then you start pointing fingers my way
I just wished you love me, love me, baby
[?]
We can make it work, baby
We'd be crazy if we don't try
[?]

Where you going, where you tryna go
Where you going, where you tryna go
Baby, baby? (2x)

Sit yourself down, ‘cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense,
‘Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

If you're workin for me
You could be with me right now
[?]
You'll be sorry if you say goodbye
Yeah, I still want you, but I don't need you…
You should be happy I'm still here for you.
I don't have to be. You must be blind if you can't see.

Where you goin' where you tryna go?
Where you goin' where you tryna go?

Sit yourself down, ‘cause you know you're gonna stay
Boy, you better listen to the words I say
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
Boy, you better act like you got some sense,
‘Cause you got a dime, and that's money well spent.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
