Song:

I will be Yours
You will be mine
Together in the eternity
Our hearts of love will be entwined
Together in the eternity
Forever in the eternity
(repeat)
No more tears of pain, in you eyes
No more fear or shame
For we will be with You
Yes we will be with You
I wil be yours, You will be mine
Together in the eternity
Our hearts of love will be entwined
Together in the eternity
We will worship
We will worship You forever
