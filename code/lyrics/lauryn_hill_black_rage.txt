Song:

Black rage is founded on two-thirds a person
"Rapings" and beatings and suffering that worsens
Black human packages tied up with strings
Black rage can come from this kinds of things
Squeezed economics, subsistence survival,
Deafening silence and social control
Black Rage is founded on wounds on the soul

When the dog bites
And the bee stings
And I'm feeling mad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't fear so bad

I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't fear so badâ€¦

Black rage is founded who fed us self hatred
Lies and abuse while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason
This grid and it's cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things

Black rage is founded on dreaming and draining
Threatening your freedom
To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water
While they say it's raining
Then call you mad
For complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy
Drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth
Murder and crime
Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice
Who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things

So when the dog bites
And the bee stings
And I'm feeling mad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't fear so bad

Free enterprise
Is it myth or illusion
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking
Or blood transfusion
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
Victims of violence
Both psyche and body
Life out of context is living ungodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denying of self
Black human packages
Tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must
But you can't have my soul
Black rage is founded on ungodly control
So when the dog bites
And the beatings
And I'm feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don't feel so bad

So Bad!
