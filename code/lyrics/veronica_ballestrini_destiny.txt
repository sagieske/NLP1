Song:

Anyone who has ever walked into my life, 
Has affected me in some way.
Any road I have ever traveled down
Has made me who, I am today

Chorus
Cuz I'm my own destiny
I'm gonna be someone somday
I am determined
I won't let anyone get in my way
I'm gonna keep on trying
Until I make it there
I'm not too sure where I'm going
But I'm, going there

When you walked into my life
I thought you were the one
But once you started to control me
I knew I had to run
I'm not looking back
I don't have time for that
You know it's hard enough
To keep this dreaming up

Chorus
Cuz I'm my own destiny
I'm gonna be someone somday
I am determined
I won't let anyone get in my way
I'm gonna keep on trying
Until I make it there
I'm not too sure where I'm going
But I'm, going there
