Song:

Sometimes the truth hurts more than lies
Found that life meant nothing today,
Forgot the very next morning
And why can't our bodies reset themselves
Won't you please reset me

I am comfortably confused and that's no thanks to you
Turn off the stereo and put us in a different direction

Found out that humanity lost it's way
Not according to radio and tv
But what has questioning ever gotten us
Hold your tongue, better watch your mouth
He is a man lurking
But what has speaking out ever gotten us

I am comfortably confused and that's no thanks to you
Turn off the stereo and put us in a different direction
What has worrying gotten us, I don't believe it's safe

Babe, I think that I'd like to leave,
This place gives me the creeps
When I think about truth
Cold sweat, your breath it chills
Cheap thrills and dollar bills
Aren't what they're cracked up to be
Just come with me, and we'll run away

Where the weathers warm and the skies are gold
Just come with me and we'll run away

I am comfortably confused and that's no thanks to you
Turn off the stereo and put us in a different direction
What has worrying gotten us, I don't believe it's safe
