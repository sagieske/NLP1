Song:

[Lyrics - Alan Duffy / Music - Steven Wilson]

I feel no pain
Cos I'm an island
I will remain
In the deafness of your silence

I love you sometimes
Always Never
He said you're here
Here with me now

I feel no gain
When you're around me
I'll try again
In the darkness you astound me

It's growing cold
I'm growing old
Is this the only way to see the fire?
It's raining...
