Song:

You say, that you've always been true
Lookin' in your eyes, I see you lie
You're trying hard to hide that
There someone new you found and,
You want me to believe that you still care

[Refrain]
How can you hurt me this way
Everything I knew was lovin' you
How could you try pretending
Your love was never ending
Now you can't even say that you will stay

[Chorus]
How, how could you say you love me
When you would go and leave me
How could you make me hurt so bad
When I have loved you more than anyone can do
Can't believe the pain
That I'm feeling now because of loving you

[Refrain]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can't seem to understand
How can love me so unkind
Still you broke my heart
Despite what I've done
Still my love was not enough
Though I given you my all
I can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
