Song:

Say a prayer, say a little common sense
Stay right there, stay right there in our defense
Give a little, bit, give a little bit more
Just a little bit, babe a little bit more

You're amazing, you're amazing and it's true
No one can save me, no one can save me like you do
This is crazy, yeah it's crazy but it's true
So baby save, baby save me like you do

Stay away, stay, close enough to care
I love that name, yeah I see it everywhere
Can we get along, can we get along much more
Just a little bit, babe a little bit more

You're amazing. You're amazing and it's true
No one can save me, no one can save me like you do
If this is crazy, yeah it's crazy but it's true
So baby save me, baby save me like you do

And when you found me I was barely breathing
You take my heart and you make it even
I'll be your strong side
I've grown
And every part of me will never go back
It's what you started in me you better know I'm all yours...

So believe me when I say
You're amazing, you're amazing and it's true.
No one can save me, so baby save me like you do
This is crazy, yeah it's crazy but it's true
Baby save me, baby, baby, save

You're amazing, you're amazing and it's true
No one can save me, no one can save me like you do
Yeah this is crazy, yeah it's crazy but it's true
Baby save me, baby save me like you do
Baby save me like you do
