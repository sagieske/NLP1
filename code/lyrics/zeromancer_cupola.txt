Song:

In under the skin
It filters through my mind
Rooms spinning around
Losing balance all the time
Shaking like a leaf
I treat you like you're glass
Cry, cry like a child
When all you want is...
When all you want is...

In under the skin
Sing Cupola
Rooms spinning around
Sing Cupola

Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this all you have to say

Hit me, Hit me, Hit me
Hit my nerves

Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this the dawn of a new day
Is this all you have to say

Hit me, Hit me, Hit me
Hit my nerves
