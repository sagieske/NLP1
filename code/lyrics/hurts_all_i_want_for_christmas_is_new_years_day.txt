Song:

Everybody waits for Christmas
For me it's New Year's day
That's gonna come and take my blues away
I'm wishing on the stars for Christmas
And hoping for a better day
When it doesn't hurt to feel this way

And everywhere there's joy around this first day of time of year
And happiness has never felt so far away

All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm not supposed to feel this way
All that I want this year for Christmas in New Year's day

It's only seven days till Christmas
Six more till New Year's day.
It's not a good time to feel this way

Everywhere the snow surrounds you
And melt your troubles away
I can only hope to feel the same

I know that we tired in the joy this time next year
But happiness has never felt so war away

All of the bells ringing out for christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
All that I want this year for Christmas is New Year's day

I remember how I used to feel at Christmas

All of the bells ringing out for Christmas
I'm singing goodbye to the year before
I know that the next one will be different
So much more
All of the bells ringing out for christmas
And I'm not supposed to feel this way
All that I want this year for Christmas is New Year's day
