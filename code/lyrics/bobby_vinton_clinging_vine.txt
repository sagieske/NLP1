Song:

[Chorus:]
Cling to me, clinging vine
Just to me, clinging vine
How I wish those arms
You're clinging to were mine
Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine

I can't believe that we're through
That you're clinging to someone new
Don't you know he'll never love you
Like I do (like I do)

Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine

[Repeat chorus 2x]

Please come back and cling to me
Clinging vine
