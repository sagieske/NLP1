Song:

I been thinkin' bout
Thinkin' bout s**
Always hungry for somethin'
That I haven't had yet
Maybe baby you got somethin' to lose
Well I got somethin', I got somethin' for you

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight
My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

Panties 'round your knees
With your a** debris
Doin' dat grind with a push and squeeze
Tied up, tied down, up against the wall
Be my rubbermade baby
An' we can do it all

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

[solo]

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight

My way - your way
Anything goes tonight,
Tonight,
Tonight,
Tonight,
Anything Goes Tonight
Anything Goes, Tonight
