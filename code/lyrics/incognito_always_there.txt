Song:

(p. allen, iii/w. jeffrey/r. laws)

Such a good feeling
That's where I wanna be (yeah)
Locked in your prison
Of total extacy (all right, all right)
You're so strong and you're so together (baby)
Next you there is nothing better


Chorus:
Always there (to please you)
Always there (when I need you)
Always there (to love you)
Always there (thinkin' of you)

And if you wanna
If you wanna do it too
There's nothing better than being here with you
'cause your love is a precious treasure (baby)
Only you can bring me joy and pleasure

Chorus

Always there
Always there (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always there
Always there (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Always there
Gotta be there baby
