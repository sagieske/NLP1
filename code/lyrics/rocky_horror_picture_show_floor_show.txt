Columbia
It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frankie fan
But it was over when he had the plan
To start working on a muscle man
Now the only thing that gives me hope
Is my love of a certain dope
Rose tints my world
Keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

Rocky
I am just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmic rush of lust
Rose tints my world and
Keeps me safe from my trouble and pain

Brad
It's beyond me help me Mommy!
I'll be good you'll see
Take this dream away
What's this? Let's see
I feel s***!
What's come over me?
Whoa! Here it comes again

Janet
I feel released bad times deceased
My confidence has increased reality is here
The game has been disbanded
My mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frankie's landed!
His lust is so sincere

*Fanfare*

Frank
Whatever happened to Fay Wray
That delicate satin draped frame
As it clung to her thigh
How I started to cry
Coz I wanted to be dressed just the same
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters
Of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares beyond any measure
And sensual day-dreamers
To treasure forever
Can't you just see it
Wo-ho hoooo

Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it

Dr. Cott
Ach! We've got to get
Out of this trap
Before this decadence
Saps our means
I've got to be strong
Und try to hang on
Or else my mind may well snap
Und my life will be lived
What is this?
Don't dream it, be it

Brad
Its beyond me help me mommy

Janet
God bless Lily St. Cyer

Frank
Mine mine mine
Mine mine mine
Mine mine
Mine mine mine mine
Mine mine

I'm wild and an untamed thing
I'm a bee with a deadly sting
You get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it til the life has gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

All
We're wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
You get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it til the life has gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

We're wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
You get a hit and your mind goes ping
Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing
So let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it til the life has gone, gone, gone
Rose tint my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain

Riff raff
Frank N Furter, it's all over
Your mission is a failure
Your lifestyles' too extreme
I'm your new commander
You now are my prisoner
We return to Transylvania
Prepare the transit beam
