Song:

Have You Ever Looked In The Mirror And Swear That You Were Seeing Someone Else, Else
It Couldn't Be More, Other Person You Seeing Just Ain't Yourself, No
You're The Water Running Face, Hoping You Would Break Up From The Stream Now, Now
And Person That You See, Now You Finally Meet... How He Feels Mad
I Wanna Talk To You, Talk To You
Your Walls Up I Can't Break Through, 
It Seems So Impossible To Get 2 Words Out Of You, Out Of You, Out Of You, Girl
To Get Something Out Of You
You Want Something Out Of Me, Let's Start With My Apology

Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa
See I Don't... Down Below, But It's... Over Me
But All I Know Is That I Want You Laying Next To Me
So Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa

I Plan To Be Best So Can Be Together Baby In The Long Run, Long Run
Balanced My Time, I Been Done Did All The Things I Should Have Done, For You
Said I'll Give You What You Need,... To Your Needs, You Gonna See Now, Now
Girl I'm Gonna Be, The Man I Used To Be, Starting Here And Now, Whoa

I Wanna Talk To You, Talk To You
Your Walls Up I Can't Break Through, 
It Seems So Impossible To Get 2 Words Out Of You, Out Of You, Out Of You, Girl
To Get Something Out Of You
You Want Something Out Of Me, Let's Start With My Apology

Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa
See I Don't... Down Below, But It's... Over Me
But All I Know Is That I Want You Laying Next To Me
So Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa

Now We All Make Mistakes Baby, Mistakes Baby
This One That I Laid Baby
Cost Me Everything Baby
Now I'm Broken Hearted Baby
But I'm Gonna Run My Pride Aside
So It Can Be You And I
That's Why I Apologize
Cause I Need You In My Life

Please, Whoa
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa
See I Don't... Down Below, But It's... Over Me
But All I Know Is That I Want You Laying Next To Me
So Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, 
Can I Get, Can I Get Your Attention, Please, Whoa.
