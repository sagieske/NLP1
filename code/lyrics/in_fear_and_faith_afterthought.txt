Song:

I'm resting my eyes so I can see you clearly
When I leave you shaking and barely breathing
(This sudden love oh so picture perfect, then I got to know you.
A dream come true turns into a nightmare.
I can't believe that I thought you were the one
But that head of yours has got to go that's why you came undone.
No more diamonds, it's over, it's time for you to go.
I'm sorry it had to, but we both know).

Once everything is said and done you'll be my afterthought
Cause I only want to see you long enough to make you hurt.
You can hold on, you can say it isn't so
But tomorrow I'll be gone before you know.

(Turn around, walk away and never come back!)
Don't you dare ever think that I cared for you.
I've got my friends and my family to get me through.

I see that you're changing
From the one I knew, to the one I'm used to.
And I know you're changing
From the one I know, to the one I am.

Once everything is said and done you'll be my afterthought
Cause I only want to see you long enough to make you hurt.
You can hold on, you can say it isn't so
But tomorrow I'll be gone before you know.
