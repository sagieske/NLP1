Yung joc (sup)
What it do nephew
All brand new sh*t

[Chorus:]
It aint my fault
(it's not my fault partna)
That everything you get is used
(you prolly can't help that)
And I buy all my sh*t brand new
(i don't have a problem with spending the money ya know)
When I walk into the room they choose
(i mean I'm yung joc man)
Cuz they know my whips my ice is brand new

[Yung Joc]
From my fitted down to my shoes
I enter the room and your b*tch might choose
Look me up and down from my head to toe
They point the exit then I tell em lets go
S5 don't forget the fifty
What it cost me? About a hundred fifty
Damn whats this? Why so sticky
That's good kush woulda cost ya bout a hundred fifty
Still on another level still brand new
Lookin at the sky through that panaromic view
She say she like my jeans even like my sneaks
That's the new guccis 500 a piece
I make her smile and I smile back
Check the doors caddystones ya I bought that
Baby we can go to paris or toronto
Brand new shades whose that

[Chorus:]

[Snoop Dogg]
Never drive the same car twice
You still buying chains
I'm in there chipping ice
Ya know is it real or fake
How much a killa make
I'm bout owning something ya digg real estate
I'm in the '08 escalade with brand new gucci shades
I'm flanging it singing it we staying up for days
You know my entourage I does it extra large
Blue bezels for my nizzles double what you charge
So whenever you see me you know I'm fresh2death
French tip on my nails and now my hair is fresh
In some brand new clothes with some brand new hoes
Is that phantom doors on that brand new rolls
On another level blue rose petals and when
I walk the the block I make everyone wanna talk alot
To brag and boast that aint my style
To high signing and profile
I'd rather blow a pound with my pound and do what you say

[Chorus:]

[Rick Ross]
I let her fantasize
I'm a fanstay
She couldn't fathom us f*cking on top of phantom seats
Now we worldwide speaking different laguages
??
Now can ya hang with it
I'm a boss girl you looking for a job
F*ck me on your lunch break and you're sure to star
Get a raise when that brain keep me in a daze
Custom made suede gucci shoes I'm on another page
And my money so long
My money so long
I sware my money so long
Versalagos just for the car doors
This the main event those niggers is side shows
Where I reside oh you consider the side oh
Ashtray and peanuts its time to slide off
Where I reside oh you consider the side oh
Ashtray and peanuts its time you slide off

[Chorus:]

[Snoop Dogg]
