Song:

Don't wait til the end
To decide that you wanted in
It's all just a game
But you still don't need to lose
It's all over too soon
It's all you're getting
All you're getting
Overload just overload
Yeah come and get it
It's all you're getting
Overload just overload
No, just breathing air
Doesn't mean you're really alive
And just take a chance
Ya it's all here for you
It's all over too soon
It's all you're getting
All you're getting
Overload just overload
Yeah come and get it
It's all you're getting
Overload just overload
You fall
You get up off your knees
You stand
You stand for what you believe
Don't take it too far
It's all you're getting
All you're getting
Overload just overload
Yeah come and get it
It's all you're getting
Overload just overload
