Song:

Ban me? Try it
You might cause a riot
What the radio won't play the underground will supply it
I'm a mc pirate, this loud not quiet
Radicle as they make, they make a rule I'll defy it
Critics may say I'm wise, some may call my words lies
I've lived more in one day than they will in their lives
Cops hate kids and kids hate cops
Cops kill kids with warning shots
What is crime and what is not?
What is justice? I think I forgot
Squeeze the trigger, 1986
Ain't a damn thing changed m**********are
