Song:

You'd better lock up your daughters
Cause the beast is in town
You know that he's trouble
You'd better not be around - no way
He comes with his circus
He's got that evil intent
And he ain't got no clowns
Just a bagful of hate

And I got to tell ya, you know his name
He's the beastmaster - he gonna tame ya
He's the beastmaster - gonna whip ya into shape
He's the beastmaster - are you ready to give your life
He's the beastmaster - gonna rip you outa sight

He's got a pact with the devil
He's got to pay off his debts
A hundred town later
He's got time to collect
If you come after midnight
He will open the cage
Could you meet the beast
In his orgy of rage

I'm leaving this town
With a hell bloody trail
The corpses of conscience are consigned to hell
The road's up ahead, he will see you tonight
'Cause the beastmaster's coming
So get outa sight
