Song:

Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang

Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain, 
She's like bang bang

You've read that I was bad news
Before you even met me
You know the dudes I hang with, 
They ain't exactly friendly
99 bottles on the wall until they empty
You were such a plain jane
Now you go bang bang

It was only one kiss, one night, 
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right

So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.

I had 30 missed calls and dirty mix drinks
When you found me getting in flirting with the girl on the sink
Call me david copperfield, 
Poof, gone before you blink
And you complain the blame game
I think it goes bang bang

It was only one kiss, one night, 
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right

So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.

Faster than a bullet train, 
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang

So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoot.

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang
So put your hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, 
Hands in the air, she's gonna shoota
