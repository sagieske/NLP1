Song:

Came the day you made your mind to put you down
Raised your voice and found it made a stronger sound

Alyda, what have you done to you

Did confusion make you act that self assured
To take the step that you were not yet ready for

Alyda, what have you done to you

While you whiled away the hour
Do you still the way I knew
Do you dream of something better
Or just something else to do

He said how you hopped until your feet grew corns
Check for some reaction then just hop some more

Alyda, Alyda, Alyda - what have you done to you, to you, to you
