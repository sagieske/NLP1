Song:

Just one look into your eyes
One look and I'm crying
Cause your so beautiful

Just one kiss
And I'm alive
One kiss and I'm ready to die
Cause your so beautiful, yeah

Just one touch I'm on fire
One touch and I'm crying
Cause your so beautiful

Just one smile and I'm wild
One smile and I'm ready to die
Cause your so beautiful, yeah

Oh and your so beautiful
My darling oh your so beautiful
Oh your so beautiful
Oh my baby
Your so beautiful

Oh and your so beautiful, yeah
Oh my darling
Oh my baby
And your so beautiful
