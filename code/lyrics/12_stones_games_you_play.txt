Song:

All the games you play
I won't take the blame

I gave you trust
You spit it out and call my name
I'm taking back what's left from all these

Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways
You take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play

I'm alone again
Sure feels good to be home

As I walk away
I know you'll feel the pain
I'm taking back what's left from all these

Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways
You take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play

I don't know why
And I don't know how
I let you control my inner self
As cold as you are
I'm counting the scars
They're proving to me just who you are
Now I know why now I know how
I'm better off without the

Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways you take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play
