Song:

Hole in my heart I couldn't change
I didn't know what was supposed to
Stuck in the fire, turn in the grave
Watching the shadows stretch and taking my face

I didn't know what was supposed to
I didn't know what was supposed to
Now I want to
Yeah, I want to now

I don't care to explain
Why you running away, why you running away
To be fair, I should say
Why you running away, why you running away

Standing alone all for the road
I didn't know what was supposed to
Creature is safe here in my veins
Watching the shadows stretch and taking my face

I didn't know what was supposed to
I didn't know what was supposed to
But I don't want to
Yeah, I want to now

I don't care to explain
Why you running away, why you running away
To be fair, I should say
Why you running away, why you running away

Ghosts were killing all the way
Why you running away, why you running away
To be fair, I should say
Why you running away, why you running away

Keep on running

I've been stuck in line all those dirty rotten times
They've got time, time is gonna pass
Hope these burning ears won't last

Sometimes I'm stuck in lies, all those stinky, twisted times
But I've got time, time is gonna pass
I hope these burning ears won't last

I don't care to explain
Why you running away, why you running away
To be fair, I should say
Why you running away, why you running away

Ghosts were killing all the way
Why you running away, why you running away
I don't care to explain
Why you running away, why you running away

Why you running away, keep on running away

Hole in my heart I couldn't change
I didn't know what was supposed to
