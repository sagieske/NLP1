Song:

Decimate the weak.
I am sent from hell, your worst fears brought to life.
I am sent from hell.
The fields will turn into flesh.
Now cross the planks of the burning bridge this time I'll lead you to death.
I'll find peace within your cries for help.
It won't be quick.
I am sent from hell.
The fields will turn into flesh.
I am sent from hell, your time is up when I say it's up.
From the depths I've risen.
I've come to take your lives, another step closer to death.
Only the strong survive.
With each breath I take another takes his last.
I've made an example out of an army.
I've shattered an empire, brought kings to their knees.
