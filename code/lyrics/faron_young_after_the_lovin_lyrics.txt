Song:

So I sing you to sleep after the lovin' with a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear what the words and the music has to say
It's so hard to explain everything that I'm feelin' face to face I seem to go dry
But I love you so much the sound of your voice can get me high
Thanks for takin' me on a one way trip to the sun
Thanks for turnin' me into someone
I sing you to sleep after the lovin' I brush back the hair from your eyes
And a smile on your face is so real that it makes me want to cry
And I know my song isn't sayin' anything new
But after the lovin' I'm still in love with you
I sing you to sleep after the lovin' I brush back the hair from your eyes
And that smile on your face is so real that it makes me want to cry
And I know that my song isn't sayin' anything new
But after the lovin' I'm still in love with you
After the lovin' I'm still in love with you
Oh after the lovin' I'm still in love with you
