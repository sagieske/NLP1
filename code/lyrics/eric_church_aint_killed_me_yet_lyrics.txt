Song:

Workin' all this overtime is good at keepin' me occupied
Hell with the stress
It ain't killed me yet

Doctor says I gotta quit
Get on the wagon and off of them damn cigarettes
But they ain't killed me yet

Doc you probably wonder why I don't care
Why I don't change, why I ain't scared

'Cause I thought her leavin'
Would stop my heart from beatin'
And gettin' over her would be my death

It hurts every night when she dances through my mind
I still feel the sting of loneliness
But it ain't killed me yet

She turned this house into a tomb
Ghosts rattle in every room, they're doin' their best
But they ain't killed me yet

So I lean on the bottle more every night
I'm probably past the point where I should give it a rest
But it ain't killed me yet

No I ain't sayin' I'll never die
But till I do, I'm on borrowed time

'Cause I thought her leavin'
Would stop my heart from beatin'
And gettin' over her would be my death

It hurts every night when she dances through my mind
I still feel the sting of loneliness
But it ain't killed me yet, it ain't killed me yet

It hurts every night when she dances through my mind
I still feel the sting of loneliness
But it ain't killed me yet
