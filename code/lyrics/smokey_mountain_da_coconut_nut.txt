Song:

The coconut nut is a giant nut
If you eat too much, you'll get very fat
Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut
But it's delicious nut is not a nut

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family

There are so many uses of the coconut tree
You can build a big house for the family
All you need is to find a coconut man
If he catch the tree, he gets the fruit free

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family

The coconut bark for the kitchen floor
If you save some of it, you can build the door
Now, the coconut trunk, do not throw this junk
If you save some of it, you'll have the second floor

The coconut wood is very good
It can stand 20 years if you create wood
Now, the coconut fruit, to tell you the truth
You can throw it or use it as firewood

The coconut leaves could shade it gives
For the roof, for the walls up against the eaves
Now, the coconut fruit, say my relatives
Make good cannonballs up against the eaves

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family

The coconut nut is a giant nut
If you eat too much, you'll get very fat
Now, the coconut nut is a big, big nut
But it's delicious nut is not a nut

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family

It's the coco fruit (it's the coco fruit)
Of the coco tree (of the coco tree)
From the coco palm family
