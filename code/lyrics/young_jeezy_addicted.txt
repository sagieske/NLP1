[Hook: Jeezy]
Man, these hoes, oh
When it come to gettin' paper, I'm gifted
Think I might relapse, I'm addicted
Man, these hoes, oh
I ain't bout to lie just to kick it
Think I need rehab, I'm addicted
Man, these hoes, oh

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Nigga have it, roll that weed up
I just want her, I don't need her
On the menu, I won't eat her
Don't eat pussy? Bitch, me neither
She addicted like Pookie on New Jack
Same old pipe, just new crack
Every time I hit, she come right back
Every time I hit, she come right back
Then I'm back to my business
Right back to my senses
Every time I'm done wit' it
Pussy callin' my name, nig'
God as my witness, these hoes! 

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
I don't like holes, all my homies locked up sittin' in 'em
I don't like hoes, the whole community put they **** in 'em
They be expecting things, tryna use that pussy power
But that power don't work when you find out it's sour
I don't kiss 'em, that's a no-no, nigga (How was that pussy?)
Kinda loose, it was so-so, nigga
She fuck wit' him, she fuck wit' me then fuck wit' him
I'm like "Aye, girl, go 'head and see how that pussy be"
Aye, she a busy body
She just tryna see how much she could get up out him, so
I don't trust 'em, I really don't trust 'em
But I gotta get my nut off though so I just fuck 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey, I can't lie, I think I might
Need rehab, she has me so high
If you lookin' for the flyest, there could be no guy
Other than I, T.I.P., harder than I
Me, why, she gotta be the sweetest of drugs
Make a nigga think no one could please me but her
I asked her where to put it, she said "Skeet it on here"
So I don't need no molly, I'm on E and on her
I prefer the prettiest bodies, go to luxurious lobbies
Hit the elevator button, on the elevator, suckin'
Sloppy blowjob 'fore a nigga touch the doorknob, I'm so hard
I can't make my **** fit, I swear I'm addicted to her

[Hook]
