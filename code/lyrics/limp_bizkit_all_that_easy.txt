Song:

In the clouds, all the grey
I'll stay if you go away
Concrete, tall as the sky
All the movement passing me by
And you blush, what a rush
Reminisce, cold crush
Next door, ear to the wind
All the tension made for the core

I wish, I wish,
I wish it was all that easy
I wish, I wish,
I wish it was all that easy
