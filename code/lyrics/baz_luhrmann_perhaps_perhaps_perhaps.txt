Song:

You won't admit you love me, and so,
How am I ever, to know,
You always tell me. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.

A million times I've asked you, and then,
I ask you over, again,
You only answer. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.

Chorus :

If you can't make your mind up,
We'll never, get started.
And I don't wanna wind up,
Being parted, broken hearted.

So if you really love me, say yes,
But if you don't dear, confess,
And please don't tell me. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.

(musical interlude)

Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.

Chorus :

If you can't make your mind up,
We'll never, get started.
And I don't wanna wind up,
Being parted, broken hearted.

So if you really love me, say yes,
But if you don't dear, confess,
And please don't tell me. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Perhaps... Perhaps... Perhaps.
