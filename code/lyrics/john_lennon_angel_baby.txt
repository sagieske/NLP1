Song:

It's just like heaven
Being here with you.
You're like an angel,
Too good to be true.
But after all, I love you, I do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.

Uh, uh, I love you,
Uh, uh, I do,
No one can love you like I do.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh.

When you are near me
My heart skips a beat.
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet.
Because I love you, I love you, I do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.

Uh, uh, I love you,
Uh, uh, I do,
No one can love you like I do.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh.

(Yeah! )

Please, never leave me
Blue and alone.
If you ever go,
I'm sure you'll come back home.
Because I love you, I love you, I do.
Angel baby, my angel baby.

Uh, uh, I love you,
Uh, uh, I do,
No one can love you like I do.

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh, uh.
Uh
