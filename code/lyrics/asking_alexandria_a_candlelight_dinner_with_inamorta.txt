Song:

This isn't over baby don't believe a word they said
But then
She takes a moment to ponder
To wonder what could've been given another chance
To find the light in the darkness and a way out of this
If only she could see what I could see
She takes a moment to stumble to her feet
If only I was there to hold her hand
If only she saw what I saw she'd get out of this one
She'd get out of here
What burns the most is that you lied right to my face
And still I hold your hand to set you free(x2)

With eyes closed, her heart breaks, after it all
She brought this on herself, on herself(x2)

For me, for you, the fallen, save her
For us, for me, for you, save her
For me, for you, the fallen, save her
For us, for me, for you, save her for me

She falls (before me)

This songs for you.

With eyes closed, her heart breaks, after it all
She brought this on herself, on herself(x2)
