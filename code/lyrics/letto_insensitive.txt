Song:

A silent move that we make
When we awake
Oh no...

My conscience
Come and go and come and go
A troubled mind and twisted hand
We use everytime just everytime...

All the sentimental feeling
That sometime makes our heart burning
We surrender to a strong desire
Ignorant to the needs of other
Hear the whisper of a little voices
That calls when we made desperate choices
Are we that oblivious?
So insensitive

... So many choices to be made
So little time to decide
So little guilt on our side
