Song:

It's late
Time for bed
So I sit, and wait
For that gin and tonic
To go to your head

I know
It's a devious plan
But it's the only way that I know
To get those big bad carkeys
Out of your habd

You know
That I remain a gentle man
But even so
There's only so much
A gentleman can stand
Sleep with me
Oh sleep with me tonight

My cards are on your table
My dreams are in your bed
If I was able
I'd be there instead

Sleep with me tonight
