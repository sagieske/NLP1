Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

You're beautiful, beautiful
You should know it
(You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You should know it)
I think it's time, think it's time that you show it
You're beautiful, beautiful
Go, Go, Go
Baby, watcha doin'? Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy?
Holding back, holding back.
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, yeah like that
So dj bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

'Cuz all around the world
People want to be loved, yeah
'Cuz all around the world,
They're no different than us, no
All around the world
People want to loved
All around the world
They're no different than us.

All around the world!

[Beat break]

You're crazy girl, crazy girl you should know it
You're crazy girl, crazy girl (don't control it)
Light it up, light it up
So explosive
You're crazy girl, ye-yeah

Baby, watcha doin'? Where you at? Where you at?
Why you acting so shy?
Holding back, holding back.
We're not the only ones doin' it like that, yeah like that
So dj bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back.

All around the world
People want to be loved, yeah

[Beat break]

[Ludacris:]
Once again,
Dynamic duos are back at it!
Jb, luda!
I love everything about you,
You're imperfectly perfect!
Everyone's itching for beauty
But just scratching the surface.
Lost time is never found,
Can the dj please reverse it
In life you pay for change
Let's make every second worth it!
Anything could work if worth it
If people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
Cuz hate may win some battles,
But love wins in the end!
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, so light that

All around the world
People want to be loved,
All around the world,
They're no different than us., no!
All around the world
People want to be loved, oh oh oh
All around the world,
They're no different than us, oh oh oh

All around the world
People want to be loved,
All around the world,
They're no different than us.
All around the world!
