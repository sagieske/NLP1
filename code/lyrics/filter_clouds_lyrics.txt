Song:

I dreamt I flew away with you tonight, across the universe at light speed.
Alright.
And just as soon as we arrived I woke to something wrong: the crystal glimmer of your eyes had vanished; you were gone! 

I thought you'd take me to higher places.
I thought you'd take me to the clouds.
As soon as we got there was as soon as I had realized heaven had just abandoned us.

I dreamt of life without mistakes tonight.
I woke to fined us out at our wake tonight.
The pages of our diary were stained with blood and tears.
The passages that we had wrote were haunted writings of two ghosts.

I thought you'd take me to higher places.
I thought you'd take me to the clouds.
As soon as we got there was as soon as I had realized heaven had just abandoned us.

I thought you'd take me to higher places.
I thought you'd take me to the clouds.
As soon as we got there was as soon as I had realized heaven had just abandoned us.
