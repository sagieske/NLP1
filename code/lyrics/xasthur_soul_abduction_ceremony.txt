Song:

The moon tonight feels my revenge
To summon forth my time (of sin) and hate
Impaled are their wings
Raped is the soul
From the bleeding holy womb
At one with night, for I'm with death
Eyes now bleed
In the color and sight of terror
The moon tonight screams with revenge
I've entered your dreams out of fear
