[Intro: Diddy]
No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly

This kid, I think he is a star
He’s on of the best live performers I’ve ever seen
He has also, more importantly a movement

[Verse:]
Backpack, f**k that, I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my s**t
Get and iPhone, take a video
I’ll make a last song, get some popcorn
Cause I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a m**********are Isn’t gonna stop this year
‘Til I make an album like a 2Pacalypse
Until I’m killin everybody like an Auschwitz
Until I’m revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I’m poppin’ all these bottle to accomplishments
Until I’m always high and mellow where the comet is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative
My name is brought up, doesn’t matter what the topic is
Didn’t think I rap? B***h I flow like boom boom bah
Bet you come from where you never move that
Look into my room, get a few look at my packs, got that
Got weed, got jack, oxys have that
Got jimmy, got slash, got shrooms, got hash
? Syndrome, ? Got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my a** you b***h

“He was truly the only developed, on point performer on the bill”

“When you think about lyricists, do you know who mgk is?”

“I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit”

[Verse 2:]
F**k that, y’all don’t gotta hear s**t
Ask anybody in the 216
If my name rings bells in them bricks
Everybody know who that is
What you hatin boy? You late boy
You ain’t heard about that great boy
That three letter name Caucasian boy
Used to live right there up the way boy
Man you heard about him you said the name
You saw the itunes and click the play
You liked the s**t and you bought the s**t
Put him on a playlist right next to Jay
And your girl saw me, I signed her t***
And she disappeared, you couldn’t find the b***h
And your heart stopped, you know what time it is
I put my d**k in that common sense
F**k boy you lonely, f**k boy you phoney
You would think these f**k boys fuckin’ boys
With the way that they be all on me
If it ain’t est in your mouth, then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it?
That s**t borin’ b***h I’m snorin’
Man I’m tourin every damn day
I’ll show y’all how to turn up
100 j’s in my ashtray b***h I’ll show y’all how to burn up
Sacraficed what y’all wouldn’t give to these kids
And now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell ‘em quit jockin’ my a**
God damn, and yall can have the bloggers I don’t type s**t
God gave me both these hands to fight with, wassup
I? A knife click cause my right hand’s like vikings
Might just throw you on the ground dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license
Get a wallet and a couple dollars my nice s**t
Dyke b*****s all up on my d**k that’s priceless
I just f**k em?
Wives is? The b***h I’m with cause they almost F like D- (get it?)
Digest every little word I’m spittin’
Cause it’s food for thought so pay attention, better listen
I’m on a mission to kill off every one of my competition
And if you are with that then good riddance mofucka

[Outro:]
Charlamagne: Machine Gun Kelly seem like someone you would diss. Lyrically I wouldn’t think you would like-
Dmx: Tryna say he’s wack or something?
Charlamagne: He is wack
Dj Envy: He’s not wack
Dmx: He’s better than 80% of the rappers out there
“It must be nice being mgk right now”

“Rage filled lyrics”
“but the rapper recently released what he says is the true meaning of the lace up movement”
“If there was ever a musical speaker that I could put out there for my personality, Machine gun kelly is it”
