There was a man lived in the moon, in the moon, in the moon. There
Was a man lived in the moon and his name was Aikendrum.

And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle. He played upon a ladle and
His name was Aikendrum.

And his hair was made of spaghetti spaghetti spaghetti. His hair was
Made of spaghetti and his name was Aikendrum.

And his eyes were made of meatballs meatballs meatballs. His eyes
Were made of meatballs and his name was Aikendrum.

And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle. He played upon a ladle and
His name was Aikendrum.

And his nose was made of cheese cheese cheese. His nose was made
Of cheese and his name was Aikendrum.

And his mouth was made of pizza pizza pizza. His mouth was made of
Pizza and his name was Aikendrum.

And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle. He played upon a ladle and
His name was Aikendrum.

There was a man lived in the moon, in the moon, in the moon. There
Was a man lived in the moon and his name was Aikendrum.
