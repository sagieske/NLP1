Song:

Hey, hey, hey!
Here's Fat Albert
And I'm gonna sing a song for you
And this is gonna show you
A thing or two
You'll have some fun now
With me and the gang
Learning from each other
While we do our thang
Na, na, na
Gonna have a good time
Na, na, na
Gonna have a good time
Hey, hey, hey!

This is Bill Cosby coming at cha with music and fun
If you're not careful, you may learn something before it's done!
Hey, hey, hey!

Na, na, na
Gonna have a good time
Hey, hey, hey!
Na, na, na
Gonna have a good time
Hey, hey, hey!
