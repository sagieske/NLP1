Song:

Take your bow. (x4)

Set yourself thin
Set aside your differences and yield
The holes in your heart, they just love to feel
We're so f*****g helpless (x2)

And so they say over and over
I can't play a thing when your intents are blown
Why will we ask us can a feel this
You're obsessed with the world you love so dear

Brevity
What do we have so far
...
The other side me
With my back against the wall (x2)

Live your life, think it well
What are you so afraid of?

And so they say over and over
I can't play a thing when your intents are blown
Why will we ask us can a feel this
You're obsessed with the world you love so dear

Brevity
What do we have so far
...
The other side me
With my back against the wall (x2)

My eyes are so clear,
I can finally see the world for what it really is
Rip your heart from your bones
You will live out your days on your knees
I'll never she'd a tear
