Song:

I feel a heavy burden
A million souls upon me weigh
Though I've felt uncertain
The more revealed, I've found my way
Am I a gift, am I a curse?
I'm one and all of God and Earth

And as the order guides me
The trials beckon brutal days
The Art of the Travelers
The Ghost Dance and the Shifter's Way
Am I a gift, am I a curse?
I'm one and all of God and Earth

At times there's no doubt within me
To ask as much of one so young
Yet I believe in the prophecy
And the framing that's been done

And I know I possess the strength
They've molded me from birth
The catalyst of all that's planned
Cleansing man from earth
Infect the venom into my veins
Of the vile beasts of earth
The transformation now takes place
The Shifter's art is learned
The Dimension Gauntlet lies ahead
I master every age
I am a God that walks the Earth
The embodiment of rage

Now the trials are over
I am complete, what I was born to be
The crown awaits the chosen
And I begin my destiny
I am a gift, I am a curse
One and all a God on Earth
