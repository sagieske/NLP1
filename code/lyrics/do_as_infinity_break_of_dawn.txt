Song:

Gathered around a fire, on the beach
One night in June yeah
Talking o' future past and love affairs
Under moonlight, drinking beer
Waiting for sunlight, drinking beer
As fire turned to ashes a man came
Asking for directions yeah
He wanted to know the way to promise land
No one knew the way, to the bright side
No one knew the way, to the right side
Accidently pointed one way, towards horizon
And he started walking slowly down the shoreline
Ooh break of dawn, we were wandering
Aimless in the darkness
Ooh break of dawn, we were roaming
Wasted in the grayness
Ended up the right place? No one knows
Gathered around a fire, on the beach
One night in June yeah
Talking o' future past and love affairs
Under moonlight, drinking beer
Waiting for sunlight, drinking beer
Did we take the right way? Drinking beer
It happened break of dawn, drinking beer
