Song:

Well we grew up together in an urban town
Just me and Billy Jones always hanging around
He was a Mumma's little boy, he was an only child
His clothes were always neat and his hair carefully styled

All the games we'd play I couldn't understand why
I'd have to play the groom and let Billy be the bride
All those pretty dresses that he's love to wear
I'd wear a floppy hat Billy he'd put flowers in his hair
He'd even wear my underwear and put flowers in his hair

A few years later you know we kinda drifted apart
My family moved south to make a new start
I missed Billy, Mum said that was wrong
Dad said 'That boy just don't know where he belongs'
Where does he belong?

A few years later I was working in a bar
It was smoky and dark, there was a blues man playing guitar
When in walked a woman wearing emerald green
With a voluptuous figure, she was beautiful and lean
She was looking pretty mean

A full martini shaken not stirred
It was only until about after her third
I started looking closely, man I should have known!
It was my old friend; you guessed it, Billy Jones
Oh my god Billy Jones! Oh s**t Billy Jones!

Tears filled our eyes as we began to speak
He'd been living a lie, a life so discreet
It made me feel sad to hear him say
In a voice so sweet 'Honey you can call me Jane'

As the night wore on we spoke of yesterday
And how Billy has always known that he was g**
I never knew how much a person could change
From little Billy Jones to lean, luscious Jane

Billy Jane Jones this comes from my heart
I hope your nights are filled with a thousand stars
But don't waste your sweetness in the empty air
'Cause you don't know how cold and dark it is out there

This is the ballad of Billy Jane Jones
