Song:

Another time, another place
We'll be together again
This kiss, this same embrace,
Will be more wonderful then.

Tho' goodbye is a sad time,
Be glad we had time to fall in love,
I need my love with you

When shadows grow, I'll miss the glow
That only you can survive,
But then, I'll just pretend
That you're still here at my side

So give me once more that kiss I adore,
Then I'll let you go
But we'll meet another time
Another place, I know
