Song:

So bold and fine
I've known you for some time
Whole life changed while, 
Bones like yours and mine
Go dance in the woods, and
Down we go, down, down.
Do you remember old times?

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you, 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too.
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do.

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you,
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too.
Oh dear boy, it's so shallow will love do,
It's a time for everything and I call you.

Sweet love of mine, destruction ain't a crime. 
For those who find love as a game like you and I.
Go dance in the waters of all the tears we've cried.
Oh boy, you're fine, do you remember old times?

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you, 
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too.
Oh dear boy, it's so hollow without you
In a world with everything but it won't do.

Oh dear boy, I wanna follow you,
You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl too.
Oh dear boy, it's so shallow will love do,
It's a time for everything and I call you.
