Song:

We're going to the beach today
We're gonna laugh and sing our cares away
The sun is shining on our face
We can take it in and let it out and say...

Chorus
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
X2

I do enjoy my time with you
Making the best of everything we do
We're gonna try on something new
And we'll make it ours before the day is through

Chorus
La, la, la, la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la, la, la
X2

And now the sun has said goodnight
Just want to say I had a real good time
I think I really feel alright (alright)
And I don't ever ever wanna say goodbye
