Song:

At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song, Whoa.

At last, the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you.

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known.

Oh, you smiled, you smiled
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last.

--- Instrumental ---

Oh, Oh you smiled, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last...
