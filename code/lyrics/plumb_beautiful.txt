Song:

Not a stitch of makeup, I wake up
Feeling less than great
I think I'm crazy, from lazy
I'm always running late
And you come home right on time just to see me
You see me at my worst
And I'm thinkin' you're thinkin'
I don't know why I married her
But you say

You're beautiful, so beautiful
Oh and you hold me tight
You're beautiful, so beautiful
And I can't speak or I'll cry
Oh I don't deserve you
Cause I always hurt you
Then you'll say the perfect thing
You're beautiful, so beautiful to me

You take care of business and listen
And make time just for me
And I'm busy rushing and hushing
Just so I can speak
And you roll your eyes that look into mine
And tell me just to wait
And I'm thinkin' you're thinkin'
She's crazy but I love her anyway
But you say

You're beautiful, so beautiful
Oh and you hold me tight
You're beautiful, so beautiful
And I can't speak or I'll cry
Oh I don't deserve you
Cause I always hurt you
Then you'll say the perfect thing
You're beautiful, so beautiful

I am selfish, self-absorbed
Narcissistic, is this normal
Running late, such a mess
Too many details, where's my dress
I wear a watch to conquer the world
Where's my keys, the tank's not full
I get in shape, it's hard to breathe
Do you love me, oh you love me

But I don't deserve you
Cause I always hurt you
Then you'll say the perfect thing
You're beautiful, so beautiful

You're beautiful, so beautiful
Oh and you hold me tight
You're beautiful, so beautiful
And I can't speak or I'll cry
Oh I don't deserve you
Cause I always hurt you
Then you'll say the perfect thing
You're beautiful, so beautiful to me

You're so beautiful
So so beautiful
You're so beautiful to me
You're so beautiful
So so beautiful
You're so beautiful to me
