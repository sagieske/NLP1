Song:

You never sleep to take rest
You never speak your mind to impress
Only fools brush him

And your smile burns brighter than the rest
And you smile at me as I brush your breast
Tired but sweet
Watch them fall at your feet

Always in my line of sight
Never hold on too tight
You just keep on coming
At your feet they are falling
And you just keep on coming
At your feet they are falling
Always looking but never touch
