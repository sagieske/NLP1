[Words butchered by Casey Orr]

Nobody's gonna take my car, it's gonna race you to the ground, yeah
Nobody's gonna take my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound, yeah
Yeah it's a killing machine, it's got everything
Got that driving power license to kill everything

I love it, I need it, I feel it
Yeah, it's a wild thing, all right, hold tight
I'm the Highway Star

Nobody's gonna take my gun, I'm gonna keep it til the end, yeah
Nobody's gonna touch my gun, or I'll shoot ya in the face
Yeah it's a killing machine, it's got everything
Yeah, got that magnum power license to kill everything

I love it, I need it, I feel it
Six cylinders, all mine, all right, hold tight
I'm the Highway Star

[Solo Scrapinetti]

Nobody's gonna take my batch, cause I still can't take no blame, yeah
Nobody's gonna take my batch, so now I'm on the road again, yeah
Yeah, I'm in heaven again, I got everything
You're a damn punk bum and I'm the king of everything

I love it, I need it, I bleed it
Yeah, it turns me on, all right, hold tight
I'm the Highway Star

[Solo Depantsia]

[Repeat 1st verse]
