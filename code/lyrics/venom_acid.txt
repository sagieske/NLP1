Song:

My brain fed with ecstacy
Fills my need
As i feel my body burst with great speed
And i clench a needle in a blood drained fist
Then i turn and mark another trip off my list
A)Feel that rush,with that gold
Satanic dust
Feel that pain,the drug induce through
My veins
I will in life as i will in death
Sow the seeds with every breath
Never will i run,never will i hide
Only to express myself and feel it deep
Inside
Acid
Now i dream in comatose neuotic state
As my paranoia grows i must wait
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die
Then i'll hit the drug again,take me high
B) Feel that buzz,for all the goddam
Good it does
Feel the flight,that flies me in through
Day and night
Now inside my arteries there's no blood
