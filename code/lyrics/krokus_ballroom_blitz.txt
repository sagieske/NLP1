Song:

Oh it's been getting so hard

Livin' with the things you do to me, aha

Oh my dreams are getting so strange
I'd like to tell you everything I see


Oh, I see a man at the back
As a matter of fact his eyes are red as the sun


And a girl in the corner let no one ignore her

'Cause she thinks she's the passionate one



Oh, yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening

And the music was soothing, and they all started grooving



Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

And the man at the back said

Everyone attacked and it turned into a ballroom blitz

And the girl in the corner said

Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz



I'm reaching out for something
Touching nothing's all I ever do


Oh, I softly call you over


When you appear there's nothing left of you, aha

Now the man in the back
Is ready to crack as he raises his hands to the sky

And the girl in the corner is ev'ryone's mourner
She could kill you with a wink of her eye




Oh yeah, it was electric, so frightfully hectic

And the band started leaving, 'cause they all stopped breathing



Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

And the man at the back said
Everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz


And the girl in the corner said

Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz



Oh yeah, it was like lightning, everybody was frightening

And the music was soothing, and they all started grooving



Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

And the man at the back said
Everyone attacked and it turned into a ballroom blitz


And the girl in the corner said

Boy, I wanna warn ya, it'll turn into a ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz, ballroom blitz

Ballroom blitz


It's it's a ballroom blitz, it's it's a ballroom blitz


It's it's a ballroom blitz, yeah, it's a ballroom blitz
