Song:

Tonight 
We're gathered here together desperate for your presence to come
Tonight 
We're here because you love us join our hearts and make us one
God of glory come and fill this place 
As it is in heaven
Let it be on earth
Let every heart that’s present give you the praise you deserve
As it is in heaven 
Let it be tonight
Right here let joy arise like an anthem we lift up your banner of love
Oh right now let every chain be broken as freedom falls like rain over us 
God of glory come and fill this place
As it is in heaven 
Let it be on earth 
Let every heart that’s present give you the praise you deserve
As it is in heaven 
Let it be tonight
Here in this generation lord let your will be done 
Creations crying out lord let your kingdom come 
As it is in heaven 
Let it be tonight
As we walk through this city 
Let your love fill these streets 
That we may see your beauty
Lord let it rain
As it is in heaven 
As it is in heaven 
As it is in heaven 
Let it be on earth 
Let every heart that’s present give you the praise you deserve
As it is in heaven 
Let it be tonight 
Here in this generation lord let your will be done 
Creations crying out lord let your kingdom come 
As it is in heaven 
Let it be tonight
Let it be tonight
