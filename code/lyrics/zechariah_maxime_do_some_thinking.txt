Song:

Verse 1
My heart beats for those who are not like me ( not like me)
They are uncomfortable in their positions
Life treats them badly, that's what they think
No home, no money
They're all alone

We with our luxury
They with no money
How can this make us live comfortably
Jesus said to share our love
They need to receive blessings from above
We need to do some thinking

Chorus
We can't leave them like that
They gotta be a part of us
So do some thinking, do some thinking
We need to help them
We gotta show our love
So do some thinking
Do some thinking

Verse 2
We need to give a helping hand
To those of such kind
Adoptions, donations, so many options
The greatest gift is love
How can we see them and react negatively
To what they go through
They need to be comforted

We with our luxury
They with no money
How can this make us live comfortably (please tell me)
Jesus said to share our love
They need to receive blessings from above
We need to do some thinking

Chorus
We can't leave them like that
They gotta be a part of us
So do some thinking, do some thinking
We need to help them
We gotta show our love
So do some thinking
Do some thinking

Bridge
What if it was you
What if it was me
Being just like them
How would it feel to be
To be homeless just like them
But no, we don't want it no no
We don't desire to be so no no
So why do we
React negatively (Do Some Thinking in Background)

Chorus
We can't leave them like that
They gotta be a part of us
So do some thinking, do some thinking
We need to help them
We gotta show our love
So do some thinking
Do some thinking
We can't leave them like that
They gotta be a part of us
So do some thinking, do some thinking
We need to help them
We gotta show our love
So do some thinking
Do some thinking
