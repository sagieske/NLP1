Song:

I'd like to remember
I'd like to know how you are
I'd like to know everything you'll be

Wherever you go, what will you do?
When the world's right in front of you

When I think of us, slowly life passes by
And I blink and you're growing, no longer a child
What I can do to capture this moment in time
Is to sing you a lullaby

I like to watch you dream
I like to touch your face
I like to hold you in a sweet embrace

Whenever you laugh, whenever you cry
And when you need a special place to hide

When I think of us, slowly life passes by
And I blink and you're growing, no longer a child
What I can do to capture this moment in time
Is to sing you a lullaby

When I think of us, slowly life passes by
And I blink and you're growing, no longer a child
What I can do to capture this moment in time
Is to sing you a lullaby
