Song:

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and how I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary

She took the pains of boyhood
And turned them into feel good
Oh, and how I wish was
Lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when I'd learned

All she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take
So now, when I get lonely
Still looking for the one and only

That's when I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary
So now, when I feel lonely
Still looking for the one and only

That's when I wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary, Mary, Mary
Mary was the girl who taught me
All I had to know

She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn't gone when I'd learned
All she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

The lights shine down the valley
The wind blows up the alley
Oh, and how wish I was
Lying in the arms of Mary

Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
Lying in the arms of Mary
Yeah, yeah, yeah
