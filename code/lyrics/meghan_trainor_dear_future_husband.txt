Song:

And don't forget the flowers
Cause if you treat me right
I'll be the perfect wife
So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking out the pies
Sing along with me
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Dear future husband
There's a few you need to know
You're going to be my one and only for life
Dear future husband
Tell I'm beautiful each and every night

After every fight just apologize
You know I'm never wrong
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
But even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Dear future husband
There's a few you need to know
You're going to be my one and only for life
Dear future husband
Don't leave me lonely

And I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed
Open the doors and you may get some kisses
Buy me a ring
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Say even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright

Dear future husband
There's a few you need to know
You're going to be my one and only for life
Dear future husband
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell I'm beautiful each and every night
Dear future husband
Better love me right
