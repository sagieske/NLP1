Song:

Written by Bruce Springsteen
Â© Bruce Springsteen (ASCAP)

Tonight my bag is packed
Tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me 'cross the border
Tomorrow my love and I
We'll sleep 'neath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border

We'll leave behind my dear
Pain and sadness we've found here
And we'll drink from the Brazos' muddy waters
Where the sky grows gray and wide
We'll meet on the other side
There across the border

For me you'll build a house
High upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory
Pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border

Sweet blossoms fill the air
Pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool clear waters
And in your arms 'neath open skies
I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border

Tonight we'll sing the songs
And I'll dream of you, my corazon
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
And may the saints' blessing and grace
Carry me safely into your arms
There across the border

For what are we
Without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters
And eat the fruit from the vine
I know that love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the border
