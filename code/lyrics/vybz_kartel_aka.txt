Song:

A. K. A. We don't play
F**k all night
Smoke all day
Claat ak
Still dj
We play music we don't play

When mi drop inna di scheme
Ghetto limousine
Mi rims a seventeen
Mi and mi Mac ii team
Mi fresh mi never green
Mi trees evergreen
Mi badda dan Joshua Samson & di Phillistine
When di sixpence clean
Alarm go off but mi nuh si nuh response team
Man dash weh dem license guns & clips & scream
Reporter seh it no real a muss a sick man's dream
But mi nuh response feeim
Mi crime dem real dem don't play play
Mi smoke my trees blen wid Craven "A"
& what's my game it's war start well
& what's my name it's Vybz Kartel

A. K. A. We don't play
F**k all night
Smoke all day
Claat ak
Still dj
We play music we don't play

Rifle wid tripod handle boy bad
While a go you sen yuh bab
Tell mi suck mi Mom & Dad
Now you deh pon "Jesus Christ oh my God"
Boy a run
Cell Block bruk him back like a crab
A nuh Bush, a we drop bombs over Bagdhad
Weh day mi could a get a gun from mi Grandad
When him seh "hold dis mi son"
Mi seh "Pappy mi nuh fire people gun"
Him seh "weh yuh claim"
Mi seh "you nuh hear mi name"

A. K. A. We don't play
F**k all night
Smoke all day
Claat ak
Still dj
We play music we don't play
