Ain't it fun when you're takin' care of number oneain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gunain't it fun when you just, just, just can't seem to find your tounge'cause' you stuck it too deep into something that really stungit's such fun
Well someone come up to me and spit right in my facei didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glassi didn't even feel it, it happened so fast
It's such fun, such fun, such funit's such fun, such fun, such funsuch fun, such fun, such funit's such fun, such fun, such
