Song:

I remember the day we met
And the sun was about to set
I often think about you day and night
How time flies by
Now there's light.

Refrain
I remember the moment
I fell in love with you
You told me (You/You'll) feel
The same way too.

Chorus
To be closer to you (closer to you)
(That's/Is) all I want to do
To be closer to you
And feel the same way too.

Bridge
I am hoping and I always pray
That God won't take you away.

All the love letters and "I love you's"
Won't mean a thing if it wasn't from you
I wish that we could be together again
Right this moment until the end.

[Repeat refrain, chorus & bridge]
Adlib
[Repeat refrain & chorus then fade]
