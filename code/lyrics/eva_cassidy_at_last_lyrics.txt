Song:

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
Ohh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
And my heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known
Oh yeah yeah

You smiled ohh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last
For you are mine at last
