Song:

Hey, girl - it's a new world, let's have a little fun!
Don't stay hidden away, come and join everyone.
Everyone.
Outside l'm ready to ride, we can go anywhere.
Don't wait, procrastinate take a chance if you dare-
I want to take you there.
Find a pace in the sun.
You know you want to go - it's no sacrifice.
I want what you want, in fact I'll even do it twice
At half the price.
Find a place in the sun.

Didn't you hear that the war has been won ?
Good people died to provide you a place in the sun.
I'm here, what's there to fear ? We're not breaking any law.
Someday I know you'll say you wonder
what you waited for
What are you waiting for ?
Find a place in the sun.

Didn't you know any wrong you have done
Cannot deny you the right to a place in the sun ?
Find a place in the sun.
