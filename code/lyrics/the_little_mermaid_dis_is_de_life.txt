Song:

Join the applause
Clap with the claws
Open the jaws and sing
This is the life
This is the life
Music and partying
(Repeat)

When I was a young crustacean
Some days had their own frustrations
I follow along and sing the same old song
One day I had the notion
That I could compose an ocean
So I took command
And now I'm leader of the band

This is the life
This is the life
Don't be such a clam
Open up and jam

I'm older and yes, much wiser
An undersea enterpriser
This crab's in his prime
Is young enough to be having a good time

This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Don't be such a clam
Open up and jam

This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
This is the life
Come on out of your shell
Let the music do it's spell

Join the applause
Clap with the claws
Open the jaws and sing
This is the life
This is the life
Music and partying

This is the life
This is the life
Music and partying
