Song:

Well alright

Speaking my mind
Speaking my mind

Your a counterfeit love stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
Your a counterfeit lover say you love me, but I don't trust you no

I never thought it would end this way,
Whatever happened to my dream girl, whatever happened to your baby
I always say there's a way,
But this time you changed it to my money, and you took my time,
You took my heart and my soul my whole life

You're a counterfeit love stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover you say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love stay back from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover you say you love me, but I don't trust you no

When I was a child I would dream,
I dream for the day when I had money,
I'd buy my baby all these little precious things just for me,
But when dreams they become reality,
She took me for my money, took me for my time,
Took me for my heart and my soul my whole life,
I never thought I'd say it I can't live a lie,
Well I was wrong and now I got to say goodbye

You're a counterfeit love stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover you say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love stay back from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover you say you love me, but I don't trust you no

Yeah well alriiiigggghhhhtt
Speaking my mind

Yeah well alriiiigggghhhhtt
Speaking my mind

You're a counterfeit love speaking my mind
You're a counterfeit lover speaking my mind
You're a counterfeit love stay away from me cause I don't trust you girl
You're a counterfeit lover you say you love me, but I don't trust you no
You're a counterfeit love...
