Song:

Oh my beloved daddy
I love him he's so hansom
I would go to Porta Rossa
To buy the ring
Yes, yes, I love him
And if my love was in vain
I would go to the old bridge
And throw myself in the Arno
I Fret and suffer torments
Oh god, I'd rather die
Daddy have pity, have pity
Daddy have pity, have pity
