Song:

I am really sad last night
See the stupid in your head
Acting like a p***y
Killing all the guts you got
You don't even fight when your enemy not satisfied
You think about disaster
But all you do is crying all night

[Chorus:]

Hey you, where, your guts
Things won't change if you keep on fighting all night
Hey you, where, your guts

Fight for your right

[Repeat again]
