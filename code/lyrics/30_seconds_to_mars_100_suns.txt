Song:

I believe in nothing
Not the end and not the start
I believe in nothing
Not the earth and not the stars
I believe in nothing
Not the day and not the dark
I believe in nothing
But the beating of our hearts

I believe in nothing
100 suns until we part
I believe in nothing
Not in Satan, not in God
I believe in nothing
Not in peace and not in war
I believe in nothing
But the truth in who we are
