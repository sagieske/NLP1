Song:

A long time ago, way back in history, 
When all there was to drink was nothin but cups of tea.
Along came a man by the name of Charlie Mops, 
And he invented a wonderful drink and he made it out of hops.

He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
And to his praises we shall always sing.
Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! 
Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer
Tiddly beer beer beer.

The Curtis bar, the James' Pub, the Hole in the Wall as well
One thing you can be sure of, it's Charlie's beer they sell
So all ye lads a lasses at eleven O'clock ye stop
For five short seconds, remember Charlie Mops 1 2 3 4 5

He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
And to his praises we shall always sing.
Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! 
Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer
Tiddly beer beer beer.

A barrel of malt, a bushel of hops, you stir it around with a stick, 
The kind of lubrication to make your engine tick.
40 pints of wallop a day will keep away the quacks.
It's only eight pence hapenny and one and six in tax, 1 2 3 4 5

He must have been an admiral a sultan or a king, 
And to his praises we shall always sing.
Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer! 
Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer beer beer
Tiddly beer beer beer.

The Lord bless Charlie Mops!
