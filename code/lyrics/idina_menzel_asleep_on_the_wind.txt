Song:

Love is a glass of wine
It's balanced on the side-rail of a ship
Across the sea as midnight comes, it may not last the daylight comes
And the trip is long
And the waves are strong
But then again, it might be up there forever
I've heard of birds that never touch the land
But sleep on the wind
And if untouched by someone's careless hand
Asleep on the wind
Our love might last until the journey ends
Alive
Alive

And our lives are just bubbles of time
They're rainbow-colored and
They're shining in the sun
They drift above the treetops now
In danger if the breeze drops somehow
And darling, that's all it would take
And yet we threaten not to break
And you know we could be up here forever
I've heard of birds that never touch the land
But sleep on the wind
And if untouched by someone's careless hand
Asleep on the wind
Our lives might last until the love begins

So stay alive and let me try as hard as you do
To stay alive, please let me be as much alive as you
I'll try
Alive
Alive
