Song:

And every once in your life

And every once in your life

(I'm your b-b-b-ass)
(I'm your bass)
(I-I'm your b-b-b-bass)
(I-I'm your-I'm-bass)
(I'm your bass creator)

The moment I saw you I was in a trance
And the feeling inside was more than I could bear
Baby it's not right, there's no promiseland
Guess to me _____ and I'm all ready there

Yeah

And every once in your life

And every once in your life

And every once in your life
You'll feel one true moment, woah
So baby open your eyes
And feel it, feel it

And every once in your life
You'll feel, it's coming over, woah
So baby open your eyes
And feel it, feel it

(I'm your bass creator)

And every once in your life

(I-I-I-I'm your b-b-b-bass creator)

And every once in your life
You'll feel one true moment, woah
So baby open your eyes
And feel it, feel it

And every once in your life
You'll feel, it's coming over, woah
So baby open your eyes
And feel it, feel it
