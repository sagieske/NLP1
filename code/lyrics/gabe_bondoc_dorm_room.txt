Song:

There's the chair
That sat next to the wall that I leaned on
In the heat of it all, I said a few things
As I stared at the lamp
Oh, the bulb was burnt out
And all the spares were out

I can still feel
The way the wall paper peeled, I tore a piece of it off
And I let it fall to the floor with a tear
You wet the room, it was white
Like the snow in the globe on your dresser

I think I left a piece of my heart
In your dresser
In case you wanna start over (x3)
I think I left a piece of my heart
In the dresser, in the dresser

There's the spot
Where you said what you said
With your hand on your foot sitting at the foot of the bed
They were strong words
Strong like the wood of the door frame
Chipped from the day that you moved in

I could hear you
It's just the light from the window
Distractingly casted, a peculiar shadow
A tear
You wet the room, it was white
Like the snow in the globe on your dresser

I think I left a piece of my heart
In your dresser
In case you wanna start over (x3)
I think I left a piece of my heart
In the dresser, in the dresser

In the room where it all began
It's only fitting that it has to end
In the room where it all began

It's only fitting this is where it ends

Oh
