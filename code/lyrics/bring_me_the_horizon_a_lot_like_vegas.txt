Song:

So cash in all your chips tonight baby
Cuz were going out of style
We could leave this city, if only for a while
We'll take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed
No one can know about this
We'll take this feeling to our graves
For every heart that we betrayed
No one can know about this
The only place, I'll call home, is my deathbed

I know we're so wrong
But it feels so right
It's not a party
If it happens every night
I'm running on empty
You're running out of luck
So let's ditch this city
Before we sober up
