Song:

Not just my princess, you're my angel
And I could stare through your eyes forever
So I wish to wake up beside you in every sunrise
And if it won't be now help me find a way somehow

I'll wait for you, I'll die without you
I'll be by your side through space and tides much longer than time

You're the riddle's answer
The last piece of the puzzle
So I wish to walk with you along the sunset-lit shore
And if it won't be now help me find a way somehow

I'll wait for you, I'll die without you
I'll be by your side through space and tides much longer than time

Please hold on, don't leave me, don't give up on me, let me be everything that you ask of me,

It will never be perfect, it may not be smooth, but I promise you I'll make things right for us soon

They wove the threads / made them into ropes
And from opposite poles
We got to tie them both
Then they lit a match
Burned what was tied
We blew the flame
But it didn't die

So I'll, I'll wait for you I'll die without you I'll be by your side through space and tides much longer than time
You're the one, I adore you, you are my bliss
