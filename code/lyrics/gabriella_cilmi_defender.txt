Song:

When nobody's listening
When you get lost in the crowd
When you don't have the answer
I'll help you figure it out
I won't let you down
As long as I live I will keep you from harm
If they wanna get to ya
They'll have to get through me first

So just remember
I am your defender
I won't let you stand there on your own
No matter what they tell ya
I will not surrender
Now until forever
You will never
Be alone

When wallets are flying
When bombs are hitting the ground
When you can't see through the fire
You know I'll pull you out

I know that you're strong
When the tables are turned
You'll be back by my side
And if they wanna break us
Well just let them try

So just remember
I am your defender
I won't let you stand there on your own
No matter what they tell ya
I will not surrender
Now until forever
You will never
Be alone

No way
I won't surrender
I'm here
Now till forever
Hold on
In this together
You know I'm your defender

I am your defender
I will not surrender
Now until forever
You will never
Be alone

No way
I won't surrender
I'm here
Now till forever
Hold on
We're in this together
You know I'm your defender

No way
I won't surrender
I'm here
Now till forever
Hold on
We're in this together
You know I'm your defender
