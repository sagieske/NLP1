Song:

We try hard to hold on too
You lost your patience and I lost my mind
Now you asked me would I go through it
If you came back one more time.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try.

Just as sure as California
Has a white atlantic shore
And a long eastern sunset
I won't want you for anymore.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try.

There will be iceburgs in the arctic ocean
There will be seashells in the Florida pan
And an old heart with in me beatin'
Before I ever take you back again.

It'll be a cold day in December
It'll be a hot day in mid July
Or a cool night in late September
Before I give our love another try...
