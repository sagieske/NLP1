Song:

Well... Young mc that is my name
And rockin it for you is my game
It is my game but whatdya like
The Young mc is on the mic
On the mic and in the place
I'm rockin it to the vicious pace
The vicious pace the vicious house
I'm really gonna make you hypnotized
Hypnotized but then you're gone
I'm rockin' it to the break of dawn
The break of dawn the break of D
Cus my name is the Young mc
Young mc is what I'm called
I'm not too heavy, not too tall
I'm not too tall, I'm never the wack
The Young mc give a heart attack
Heart attack is what I give
I'm really gonna make you want to live
You want to live you want to die
You rockin' the vicious can't deny
Can't deny just what you hear
You rockin' it days and month and year
Month and year and month and day
I'm really gonna take your breath away
Breath away and breathalizer
Rhymin' like a synthesizer
Synthesizing music machine
Rock the house you know what I mean
What I mean is what I say
Going to rock the house today
You rock today you rock tonight
You're gonna to really do it right
Do it right and do it wrong
I'm going to make you sing a song
You sing a song cold with the glee
Cause my name is the Young mc
