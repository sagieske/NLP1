Song:

(Dylan)
All I really want to do is baby be friends with you

I don't want to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Classify ya, simplify ya, deny, defy or crucify you

All I really want to do is baby be friends with you
Baby be friends with you

No, I ain't lookin to fight with you
Frighten you, up-tighten you
Bring you down or chain you down
Drag you down, or bring you down

Chorus x2

I don't want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or respect you or reject you

Chorus
