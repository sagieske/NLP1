Song:

Annabelle you think you're so damn special
But there's a million other girls like you
30 minutes and you say we're official
But I have got some news for you

I need a girl, not a body with a complex
I got a heart and you got your lipstick
Fine as hell, but I think I might as well drop Annabelle

You're staying up just to dance alone
I'm dressing down 'cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part, but looks don't tell the truth, whoa
Well baby you're pretty, but I'm pretty sure I'm over you

You can't even hold a normal conversation
But you can tell your friends I ruined your life
Whatever helps your perfect reputation
'Cause I'm not losing sleep tonight

I met a girl and she's more than a pretty face
6 drinks and she still remembers my name
Fine as hell, but I think I might as well drop Annabelle

You're staying up just to dance alone
I'm dressing down 'cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part, but looks don't tell the truth, whoa
Well baby you're pretty, but I'm pretty sure I'm over you

Turn around, turn around and walk away
I want out, I can't take another day
Even though she moves so well, oh
But I don't need a girl like Annabelle

You're staying up just to dance alone
I'm dressing down 'cause I'm tired and I wanna go home
You look the part, but looks don't tell the truth, whoa
Well baby you're pretty, but I'm pretty sure I'm over you (x2)

Maybe she's pretty, but I don't need a girl like Annabelle
