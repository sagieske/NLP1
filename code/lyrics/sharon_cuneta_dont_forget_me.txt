Song:

Don't forget me
I'm hoping that you won't forget me
There's no doubt, I blew it there
Gave up the best love that I ever had
I never thought I could be
So sad til now

Please remember,
I'm hoping that you will remember
That the times we were together,
It was at always stormy weather
There were even times when
The sun came shinin' through
And I know we've come to the
Parting of our ways,
And I know, we said all the things
That we could say.
And I know, I can put myself
Back together again
If the fate will let me.
Don't forget me...

I'll remember,
I know that I will always remember
And I hope you'll have a
Peaceful life,
You never had
While I was you wife...
And though,
I know there is nothing I can do
I'll never forget you...

And I hope you'll have a
Peaceful life
You never had
While I was your wife
And though I know
There is nothing I can do

I will never...
I will never...
I'll never forget you...
Don't forget me...
Don't forget me...
