Song:

Caricatures of your wrecking ball
Down in my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel-patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke

And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lining up 
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

All my own stunts
Hiding has changed it's tune 
Linking arms, syncing hearts

And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

'Cause I'm from High Green, I'm from High Green
