Song:

White walls surround us, 
No light will touch your face again.
Rain taps the window, 
As we sleep among the dead.

Days go on forever, 
But I have not left your side.
We can chase the dark together, 
If you go then so will I.

There is nothing left of you, 
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels, 
And say the last goodbye.

Cold light above us, 
Hope fills the heart and fades away.
Skin white as winter, 
As the sky returns to grey.

Days go on forever, 
But I have not left your side.
We can chase the dark together, 
If you go then so will I.

There is nothing left of you, 
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels, 
And say the last goodbye.
I keep holding onto you, 
But I can't bring you back to life.
Sing the anthem of the angels, 
Then say the last goodbye.

You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.
You're dead alive.

There is nothing left of you, 
I can see it in your eyes.
Sing the anthem of the angels, 
And say the last goodbye.
I keep holding onto you, 
But I can't bring you back to life.
Sing the anthem of the angels, 
And say the last goodbye.

Sing the anthem of the angels, 
And say the last goodbye.

Sing the anthem of the angels.
