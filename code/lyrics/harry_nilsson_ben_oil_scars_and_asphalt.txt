Song:

Ben (Oil, Scars and Asphalt)

Stuck on a chair, eyes on the screen
Haven't moved for a couple of weeks
Static

Made a circle and you drove in
Now you're the center of everything
And I'm pathetic

Never fell for such a prototype
A big mouth little heart mister Motorbike
I'm crushing

Don't know whether to cry or laugh
'Ready and willing' drops out of your head
Real dramatic

-Ben- I just want
To taste you once
Blow the screen, tasting real
Oil, scars and asphalt

-

I don't wanna be no Vulture
Way too weak
I don't wanna be no Rottwheeler
Way too big
I don't wanna be no Caveman
Way too mean
I just wanna taste a pearl of real sweat
You Polecat

I made a circle and you drove in
Now you're the center of everything
and I'm pathetic

-Ben- I just want
To taste you once
Blow the screen, tasting real
Oil, scars and asphalt
