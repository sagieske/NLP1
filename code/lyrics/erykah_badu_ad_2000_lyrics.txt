Song:

No you won't be name'n no buildings after me
To go down dilapidated ooh
No you won't be name'n no buildings after me
My name will be mistated, surely

His world done changed
So much yeah yeah
This world done changed
Since I been conscious

This world done changed
So much yeah yeah
This world done changed
Since I been conscious

Oh, what in the world will we do?
Will we ever make it, yeah
Oh yeah know it ain't right
Oh, is it in Your plan?

Say, I won't be name'n no buildings after me
To go down dilapidated
No you won't be name'n no bulidings after me
My name won't be mistated, surely
Surely, surely...

And oh...
And oh...
And oh...

(ad-libs)

No you won't be name'n no buildings after me
To go down dilapidated, no
No you won't be name'n no buildings after me
My name will be mistated, surely
Surely, yeah, yeah
Mmm hmm, ooh
