Song:

It's hard to take the first step
When I don't know the way
Each turn is so uncertain
I learn to walk by faith
But you gave me a promise
That you will never leave
You will lead and guide me
Lord I do believe

Chorus:

Lead me lord
I will follow
Lead me Lord
I will go

You have called me
I will answer
Lead me Lord
I will go

Your plans for me are perfect
I never need to fear
For though at times I feel alone
I know that you are near
My heart just longs to follow
I'm willing to obey
Take my hand and lead me
I follow all the way

Chorus. 2 fois

You have called me
I will answer
Lead me Lord

(2 fois)

I will go
