Song:

There's something in the air tonight
I feel it in my skin
The pleasure coming in
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I'm slowly giving in

I hope it never ends before the sun appears
Turning the ocean to blue
I'm swimming in a different
Point of view

I feel so high I don't know why
It happens when I'm with you
I feel so high I don't know why
I wear it like a new tattoo
Like a flaming heart with your name inside it
You, you're under my skin and I just can't hide it
So don't fade to blue
Cause I need you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Never thought it'd be like this
You'kinda like a scar
And "X" across my heart
It hits me and I can't resist
Gives me what I need
Addicted but

I'm free when I'm alone with you
Floating on top of the earth
Carelessity like gravity
In reverse

I feel so high I don't know why
It happens when I'm with you
I feel so high I don't know why
I wear it like a new tattoo
Like a flaming heart with your name inside it
You, you're under my skin and I just can't hide it
So don't fade to blue
Cause I need you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
