Song:

I believe in miracles and I can tell you why
Once a year the street I live on sparkles like the sky
All hung with lights for Christmas
Twinkling ev'rywhere
The world turns bright for Christmas
And if that isn't a true blue miracle
I don't know what one is

I believe in miracles
I know because I've seen
Once a year the place I walk is filled with trees of green
And pine cone smells of Christmas
Floating thru the air
To jingle bells of Christmas
And if that isn't a true blue miracle
I don't know what one is

But the greatest wonder of them all
Is not what's happening around you, it's the way
You start to be
Yes the greatest wonder of them all is how your
Heart is filled with love
You start to light up like a Christmas tree

Feelings feel so wonderful
You have to let them show
Maybe that's why ev'ryone begins to get a glow
And fill their hearts with Christmas
Spirit they can share
That's the best part of Christmas
And if that isn't a true blue miracle
I don't know what one is
And if that isn't a true blue miracle,
I don't know what one is
