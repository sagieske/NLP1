Song:

Feeling all the love I swear that it’s in the air
Leaving me, floating forever into infinity
I can see the colors dance when I close my eyes
Witnessing mysterious design
I can feel my body rush
From the love inside of me

Can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
It sets me free

Why can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
It sets me free

We walk around blinded like children in the dark
So cold and so empty, how did this even start
It’s time to remember what it’s like to feel alive
Feel alive! Set me free! Set me free! 

Can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream
It sets me free

Why can’t you see the joy of life is right before your eyes?
Infinite bliss, infinite love
Take a chance, close your eyes and just dream

Feeling all the love I swear that it’s in the air
Leaving me, floating forever into infinity
Quantum fluctuations project into the air
Leaving me floating forever into infinity
Infinite potential! Infinite potential!
