Song:

Across the river you can dance all night
A pretty little girl that I left behind
I know you're not waiting on me
Look at you girl you're just skin and bones
You're breaking all the hearts of the boys back home
And I know you're not waiting on me
Well alright
Drove across the river
Made me sleep in the van
You were making time with the boys in the band
And you know I'll say it's alright
Look at you little girl you're all grown up
You say it don't matter and you sound so tough
You know I'll say it's alright
Well alright
A girl built for trouble from Arkansas
And a boy with the most metal heart of all
You said we're gonna work on that when I get back
When i get back you're gonna break this heart
Well alright
