Song:

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one

High King of Heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven? S joys, O bright heaven? S sun
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O ruler of all

Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
High King of Heaven, my treasure Thou art
