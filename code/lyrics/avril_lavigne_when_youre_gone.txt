Song:

[Intro - Instrumental (16 seconds)]

[Verse 1]
I always needed time on my own,
I never thought I'd, need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone,
And the bed where you lied,
Is made up on your side.

[Refrain]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone,
The pieces of my heart are missing you!
When you're gone,
The face I came to know is missing too!
When you're gone,
All the words I need to hear to always get me through the day...
And make it OK...
I miss you.

[Verse 2]
I've never felt this way before,
Everything that I do,
Reminds me of you.
And the clothes you left,
They lie on the floor,
And they smell just like you,
I love the things that you do!

[Refrain]
When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[Chorus]
When you're gone,
The pieces of my heart are missing you!
When you're gone,
The face I came to know is missing too!
And when you're gone,
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day...
And make it OK...
I miss you.

[Middle-eight]
We were made for each other,
Out here forever,
I know we were,
Yeah Yeah!
All I ever wanted was for you to know,
Everything I do I give my heart and soul,
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me...
Yeah!

[Chorus]
When you're gone,
The pieces of my heart are missing you!
When you're gone,
The face I came to know is missing too!
When you're gone,
The words I need to hear will always get me through the day...
And make it OK...
I miss you!
