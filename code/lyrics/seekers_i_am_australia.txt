Song:

I came from the dreamtime
From the dusty red-soil plains
I am the ancient heart
The keeper of the flames
I Stood upon the rocky shore
I watched the tall ships come
For fourty thousand years I've been the first australian

I came upon the prison ships
Bound down by iron chains
I cured the land
Endured the lash
And waited for the rains
I'm a settler
I'm a farmers wife
On a dry and barron run
A convict and a free man
I became Australian

I'm a daughter of a digger
Who sought the mother load
The girl became a women
On the long and dusty road
I'm a child of the depression
I saw the good time come
I'm a bushy I'm a battler
I am australian

Chourus:

We are one
But we are many
And from all the lands on earth we come
We'll share a dream
And sing with one voice
I am, you are we are australian

I'm a teller of stories
I'm a singer of songs
I am Albert namajera
And I paint the ghostly gums
I'm clancy on his horse
I'm ned kelly on the run
I'm the one who waltzed matilda
I am australian

I'm the hot wind from the desert
I'm the black soil of the plain
I'm the mountains and the valleys
I'm the drowned and flooding rains
I am the rock
I am the sky
The rivers when they run
The spirit of this great land
I am australian
