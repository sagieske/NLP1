Song:

You said "Come to me, if you're weak"
"I won't look away & I will keep you close"
But the closer I get the harder it seems
I find myself pulling away from all of the things I believe

[Chorus:]

Lord, don't give up on me, it's You I need
So let your love rain down upon my soul
Filling up the deepest hole
I still love You so
I have tried to cross this river wide

And even though the storms were raging high
I could see Your light shining constantly
(I could see morning light shining constantly)
Constantly, You were always there

You said "Lay it down. give it up"
"I will understand no matter what it is"
But instead I face failures & constant disbelief
That you could ever love me knowing the secrets I keep

Despite my broken heart & shattered dreams
Lord, Your right there reminding me, reminding me

Oh, I have called to You in time of need
You let Your love rain down upon my soul
Constantly You let me know, I still love You so
Oh, I have tried to cross this river wide
And even though the storms were raging high
I could see the morning light, shining in the sunrise
Constantly
