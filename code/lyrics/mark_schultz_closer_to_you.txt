Song:

Closer to me,
I'm tired and I'm weak.
Every breath within me
Is longing just to be,

Closer to You,
So I face the road ahead,
Cos I know there's no comparing
To what's waiting at the end.

Let the rain start falling where it will.
I will run through this valley just to climb to that hill.
If the ask why I'm smiling after all I've been through,
It's cos I'm just a day closer to you.

Closer to me,
I hear you whisper on the wind.
You say although my life is fading,
A new one will begin.

Closer to You,
And I know I'm not alone,
Cos I can hear you in the distance,
Saying, "You are nearly home."

Let the rain start falling where it will.
I will run through this valley, just to climb to that hill.
If they ask why I'm dancing though my days may be few.
It's cos I'm just a day closer to You.

Closer to me,
You're in the laughter and the tears
Of the ones I leave behind me
Who have prayed me through the years.

Closer to You,
And I know it won't be long
Til You're running down the pathway,
Just to take me in Your arms.

Let the rain start falling where it will.
I will run through this valley just to climb to that hill.
If they ask why I'm singing though my life's almost through.
It's cos I'm just a day closer.
I'm just a day closer
I'm just a day closer to You.
