Song:

[Verse:]
I don’t know
What went wrong
You lost the key to our song yea
But we had it made for so long
There were nights by your side I would cry cause the flame was gone yea

No words, it hurts
Way too much to speak
Oh oh

[Pre-Chorus:]
It’s time for me to break the silence
Cause we’ve been screaming so loud on the inside
It’s time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad but it ain’t right
Cause I can’t feel the love is dying

[Chorus:]
But if you ain’t about it girl
And kiss my soul, but you stood there oh
We might not miss this chance
To break the silence

[Verse:]
There’s a melody in my mind
As the memories of us fly away
And I can see
That you need to find
A new way to replace all the white noise in your life yea yea

[Pre-Chorus:]
It’s time for me to break the silence
Cause we’ve been screaming so loud on the inside
It’s time for me to break the silence
I wanna hold you so bad but it ain’t right
Cause I can’t feel the love is dying

[Chorus:]
But if you ain’t about it girl
And kiss my soul, but you stood there oh
We might not miss this chance
To break the silence

[Bridge:]
If you could only hear my heart
We will make it through…
