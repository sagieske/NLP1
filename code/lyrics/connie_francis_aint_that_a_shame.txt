Song:

You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame.

You broke my heart when you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame.

Oh well, goodbye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame, yeah.

--- Instrumental ---

You made me cry when you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame.

Oh well, goodbye, although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame my tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame, yeah...
