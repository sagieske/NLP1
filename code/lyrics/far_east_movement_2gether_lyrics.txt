Song:

We can get together

Now I don't usually do this
But I ain't myself tonight
I wanna drink a lil mo, mo
Forget it all, all
And dance till I'm dead, dead, dead on the floor (floor)

E-very one must shine together tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight [2x]

I-I-I been partying my whole life
But something feels different tonight
I been buzzin' my whole life
But something bout you buzzin' me right (right)

Yo
This is club is goin' crazy
You've got me goin' crazy
This dj's goin crazy
And now I'm elevated
We havin' fun in here
So hands up in the air
We havin fun in here
So get your hands up in the air

Now I don't usually do this (this, this)
But I ain't myself tonight (night, night)
I wanna drink a lil mo (mo)
Forget it all (all)
And dance till I'm dead, dead, dead on the floor (floor)

E-very one must shine together tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight [2x]

I-I-I been lovin' my whole life
But somethin' feels different tonight
I been jumpin' my whole life
But you got me jumpin' tonight

Yo
This is club is going crazy
You've got me goin' crazy
This dj's goin' crazy
And now I'm elevated
We havin' fun in here
So hands up in the air
We havin' fun in here
So get your hands up in the air (air, air, air...)

Tonight I don't care
We waited all year
Everyone shine
Get yo hands in the air
[2x]

Tonight I don't care
Get yo-g-g-g-get yo hands in the air

Everyone my shine together tonight [2x]

Tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight tonight...
