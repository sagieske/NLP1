Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream

When I want you in my arms
When I want you and now your charms
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream

When I want you in the night
When I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away

I need you so and that is why
I love you so, don't say goodbye
Whenever I want you
All I have to dream

I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away

I need you so and that is why
I love you so, don't say goodbye
Whenever I want you
All I have to dream

Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
