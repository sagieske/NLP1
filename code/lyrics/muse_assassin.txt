Song:

War is overdue
The time has come for you
To shoot your leaders down
Join forces underground

Lose control
In increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
A time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born (yeah)

Appose and disagree
Destroy Demonocracy

Lose control
In increasing pace
Warped and bewitched
A time to erase
Whatever they say
These people are torn
Wild and bereft
Assassin is born (yeah)
