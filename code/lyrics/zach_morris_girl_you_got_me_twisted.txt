Chorus
Girl
I f***n' hate you
Got me f***n' twisted
Why the hell do you do this s**t to me?
You got me twisted

Damn b*tch you

You sl*t you got me twisted!

You dumb d*ke
You f*** that guy all night
Will you just quit d**kin' around
With my g** **mn life?

Chorus

You dumb**ss f***
You f****d up my life

You shotty-*ss d*ke

Damn you

You f****d up nerdy girl
You stupid peice of t*tt

Why can't I get you off my mind?
Girl, why did you f*** up my life?
I no longer give a s**t about you
I am surprised anybody ever f****d you!

You f****d me up
You had me twisted
But I am twisted no longer

I am twisted no longer
