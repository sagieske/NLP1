Song:

There
I was waiting for a chance Hoping
that u'll understand The
things I wanna say As

my love Is
stronger than before I
wanna see u more and more But
you close the door Why

don't u try To
open up your heart I
won't take so much of your time Maybe...

it's wrong to say please love me too Coz
I know u never do Somebody
else is waitin' there inside for you Maybe...
it's wrong to love you more each day Coz
I know she's here to stay But...
I know to whom you should belong I...

believe what u said to me We
should set each other free That's
how u want it to be Coda...

But:
my love is strong I
don't know if this is wrong But
I know to whom you should belong
