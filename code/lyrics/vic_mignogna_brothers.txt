Song:

(Edward)
How can I repay you, brother mine?
How can I expect you to forgive?
Clinging to the past
I she'd our blood, and shattered your chance to live
Though I knew the laws, I paid no heed
How can I return your wasted breath?
What I did not know has cost you dear,
For there is no cure for death

Beautiful Mother,
Soft and sweet, once you were gone
We were not complete
Back through the years
We reached for you
Alas, t'was not meant to be

And how can I make amends for all that I took from you?
I led you with hopeless dreams
My brother, I was a fool

(Alphonse)
Don't cry for the past now, brother mine
Neither you nor I are free from blame
Nothing can erase the things we did,
For the path we took was the same

Beautiful Mother,
Soft and sweet, once you were gone
We were not complete
Back through the years
We reached for you
Alas, t'was not meant to be

My dreams made me blind and mute
I longed to return to that time
I followed without a word
My brother, the fault is mine

(Edward)
So, where do we go from here?
And how to forget and forgive?
What's gone is forever lost
Now, all we can do is live
