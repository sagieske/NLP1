Song:

Flying Down to Rio
Fred Astaire
Words by Gus Kahn and Edward Eliscu; music by Burton Lane.

Introduced by Fred Astaire and chorus in the motion picture "Flying Down to
Rio. "

My Rio, Rio by the Sea-o,
Flying down to Rio where there's rhythm and rhyme.
Hey feller, twirl that old propeller,
Got to get to Rio and we've got to make time.
You'll love it, soaring high above it,
Looking down on Rio from a heaven of blue.
Send a radio to Rio de Janeiro,
With a big hello just so they'll know and stand by there,
We'll fly there.
Hey, Rio, ev'rything will be okay,
We're singing and winging our way to you.
