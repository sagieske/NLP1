Song:

Almost blue
Almost doing things we used to do
There's a girl here and she's almost you

Almost
All the things that your eyes once promised, I see in hers too
Now your eyes are red from crying

Almost blue
Flirting with this disaster became me
It named me as the fool who only aimed to be

Almost blue
It's almost touching , it will almost do
There is part of me that's always true

Always
Not all good things come to an end
Now it is only a chosen few
I have seen such an unhappy couple

Almost me
Almost you
Almost blue
