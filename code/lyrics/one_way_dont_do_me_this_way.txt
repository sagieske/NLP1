Song:

Honey, what is wrong?
The kisses are not quite the same
You don't hold me anymore
Is someone knocking on my door

Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way

You don't say my name
I could hear it so warm before
Have you found somebody new?
Are you ending the love we grew?

Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way

Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way
Don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way

Simply because I love you
I want you, I need you
I'm asking you don't do me this way
