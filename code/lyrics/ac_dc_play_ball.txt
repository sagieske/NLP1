Song:

Listen!

Pick me up
Fill my cup
Pour me another round

Come on man, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said! 
it's party time
When I'm on the loose
Make it feel alright
Listen, drinks all around I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine

Let's play ball
Shoot down the walls, yeah!
Let's play ball, baby
Battin' down the stalls
Play, play, play ball

Listen Sid, light me up
I'm in love
I'm off the leash and unbound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud

Let's play ball
Shooting down the wall, yeah
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball

Let's play ball
Shooting at a wall
Let's play ball
And never stall
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball
