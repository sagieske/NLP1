Song:

I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg

[Verse:]
Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in the European swervin' name
Look, describe Iggy ground breaking what the word is
Hit the stage, yeah, shake it like I'm nervous
Winning then got me workin', not on medicine
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose
I-G-G-Y, think she just had to do it better
Ride with me, fly livin', there ain't nothin' to it
Am I wastin'? Expect you gotta let me get my cake on
Take on, that's where am at it

[Chorus:]
I know you like the way I turn it up
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Verse 2:]
P***y pow, playing by the hour
I need me a braveheart, can't deal with the cowards
I tell 'em fiend balling, he should hit the shower
If I pick you you lucky baby this money ours
All yellow gold on me like I'm Trinidad
Sitting drop top wonder where sailor's at
I know my old game, wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new game, baby I ain't feeling that
And Iggy, Iggy, Iggy can't you see that everybody wanna put a hands on me
See I be on this money while your man on me
And I need another hand with all this Benz on me

[Chorus:]
I know you like the way I turn it up
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

[Bridge:]
Get up out my face like what you think you are
Talking all this trash like blah-di-blah-di-blah
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh
Get up out my face like what you think you are
Talking all this trash like blah-di-blah-di-blah
Oe oh, na uh, Oe oh, na uh

[Chorus:]
I know you like the way I turn it up
I'm out here with my friends
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
I do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'mma make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it

Bad boy look boy I like to drop
If you want my love then smoke it up
Make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
Bad boy look boy but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a f**k
Make you beg, I'mma make you beg for it
