Song:

Here I am again
Trying to take my chance
I'm longing for your touch
Longing for your warm embrace
Oh how I miss you baby

Here I am again
Trying to say the words
I failed to say before
I wish I've said it all to you
Oh how I love you baby

Refrain:
You're the only one
Who can make my life complete
Oh baby your love is all I need
You're the only one
Who can bring a smile to me
The only one that I wanna be with

Here I am again
Waitin' for the time
When you will say the words
That made us to become one
Oh how, I long for your love

(Instrumental)

You're the only one
Who can bring a smile to me
The only one that I wanna be with

Here I am again
Trying to say the words
I failed to say before
Oh how I love you so
