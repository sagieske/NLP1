Song:

Baby, I wish I could have been more for you
As I watch you leave
I can not believe
So it's come to this
All my friend they laugh
Cos I want you back... Back with me

My baby is gone gone gone
My baby is gone from me
Have you seen my baby... For me
(2x)

I feel just like a fool to let you walk away
I wish I held you closer
And not push you away
I didn't understand you
I thought your love was strange
I wish I kissed you deeper
Can we find a way... A way

My baby is gone gone gone
My baby is gone from me
Have you seen my baby... For me
(2x)

Aaahhh hhhmmm eeehhh yeeehhh

Can I say I'm sorry?(3x)

Ohhh my baby is gone
Is gone from me(2x)
My baby is gone
Have you seen my baby

My baby is gone gone gone
My baby is gone from me
Have you seen my baby... For me
(2x)

Have you seen my baby for me... For me
Oooh...
