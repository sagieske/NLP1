So I'm just
Supposed to say
Some corny ish?
Ha, ha
Nah

Uh, yezzir
It be that

That
Breezy millionaire
Milli here
And million there
Selling out stadium
A million chairs
Stepping on and off
Stage killing em
I got
A million pairs
Of them all
White million airs
I am a beast
Hurry competition
Come please
Lock em up
Lock em up
Just put em
On freeze
On ice
I'm doing things
That rappers
Don't like
And I am making
A milli (2x)
I am making
A millie (3x)
Getting money
Throw it up
And watch it
And when it
Comes down
It's like magnets
In my pocket
Damn I got it
Purple
And green diamonds
They swang
From my chest
Bigger and bigger
Man I think
The Hawks on my neck
A billion
Jay-Z, Weezy, Breezy
So what us million
