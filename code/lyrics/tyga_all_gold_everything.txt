Song:

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch
N***a nigga n***a don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch, n***a nigga n***a
Don't believe me just watch, b***h, don't believe me just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch

T-Raww I don't f**k with n****s
My money long my temper midget
King gold chains I reinvented
This gold s**t, you a gold fish n***a
Try me 4 kings like free sale n***a
Sippin' out a cup like a toddler n***a nigga
Who the f**k want drama pain
Back got it like a chiropractor mane
Got that n***a rock quarter mill and chain
Got score at your lights stakes a lane
N***a nigga sunroof your brain
Claim that you drink but you can't even hang
Only came cause a n***a got paid
Sleep with them hoes, they gon f**k up your name, name
Pop the zanny I'm stressin, woo, pop the molly I'm flexin, woo
Dre Beats my beats bang, biker jeans ball me
She suck me off till I'm all drained
Kick her out Lu Kang, (bitch)
Wide body need two lanes, got a five oh four b***h go to Tulane

N****s think that I'm playing I ain't saying it just to be saying it and n***a make your bed laying in...

Born sinner, make a n***a die for his dinner
Eyes of a tiger stone killer cold blooded when I (bah)
F*****g beast, goin' ham gotta eat
Thanksgivin don't thank me, cause that ain't beef
Yall n****s sweet, money leech, money laundering
Private jet I don't fly economy

Man I'll make it rain while you n****s tryin maintain
All my n****s gang bang, shout out Honey Cocaine

Last Kings, ymcmb b***h
One eighty seven stay on some G s**t

Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch
N***a nigga n***a don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch, n***a nigga n***a
Don't believe me just watch, don't believe me just watch
Gold all in my chain, gold all in my ring
Gold all in my watch, don't believe me just watch
