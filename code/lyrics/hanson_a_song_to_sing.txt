Song:

Goodbye four leaf clovers.
Hello gone awry
Don't cry the fight ain't over
Unless you let it pass you by

(chorus)
I'm looking for a song to sing,
Looking for a friend to borrow.
I'm looking for my radio.
So I might find a heart to follow.

I've never been this
Longing for your lovin'
I've never been so
Wearin' down to nothin'
I've never been just
Looking for a reason.
So maybe you've been thinkin'
Of me.
Oh...
You've been thinking of me.

All that I have found in reason,
Is reason just to not believe.
And all that you are left is treason.
Is treason just to let I be.

(chorus)

I'm looking for a song to sing,
Looking for a friend to borrow.
I'm looking for my radio.
So I might find a heart to follow.

I've never been this
Longing for your lovin'
I've never been so
Wearin' down to nothin'
I've never been just
Looking for a reason.
So maybe you've been thinkin'
Blue yonder dreams
And second hand shoes
You're so far gone,
That you're left to lose.
It's too late to go home
All alone.
Your the tar in that
Old cigar
And the worn out cable
On a cable car - and,
You're too tired to admit
You've gotta choose.

(chorus)

I'm looking for a song to sing,
Looking for a friend to borrow.
I'm looking for my radio.
So I might find a heart to follow.

I've never been this
Longing for your lovin'
I've never been so
Wearin' down to nothin'
I've never been just
Looking for a reason.
So maybe you've been thinkin'
Of me.
Oh...
You've been thinking of me.
