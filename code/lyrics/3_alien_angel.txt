Song:

Here - follow
Hollow are these haunted hills
Far below the ground
Searchers in the deep reveal
That you could have been
Caught up in
All those empty odds
Alive but not awake
Promises
Am I seeping through?

Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground

Born in motion
Forward is your only course
Plunge the gaping edge
Fallen into flesh and bone
You could've been
Caught up in
All those empty odds
Alive but not awake
Promises
Am I seeping through?

Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground

Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground

Are you an angel?
Are you an angel?
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground
