Song:

I wish I could have met you
In a year or two
Ah, maybe then you could have seen
What I saw in you

And I think that
You were still tryin' to forget someone
You used to known
And there just wasn't enough time
Between her Goodbye and my Hello

Boy I want to try for a while
But I could always see
A place I can fill with love
For a memory

'Cause I can?
I could still see the flame burnin'
Soft and low
And there wasn't enough time
Between her Goodbye and my Hello

Especially those heartbreaking kind
Lord it looks like I just came along too soon
'Cause she still takes up too much of your time

If I can? day
I know we could have made it baby
We almost made it anyway
But you weren't completely free
Because someone else's memory
Just wouldn't let you go
And there wasn't enough time
Between her Goodbye and my Hello

Baby... 
All we needed was a little more time
I need that time to build...
