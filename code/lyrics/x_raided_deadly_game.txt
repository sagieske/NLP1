[Verse:]
X-Raided Loc never was a choir boy
Ya folks got a gang of priors
Maybe that's why one-time's be triflin
Tryin to give a young n***a 35 to life
When I ain't even done nothin wrong officer
I have no info to offer ya
He asked my name, So I came off the brain
Told him, "I am John Doe and this is my hoe Jane"
He said, "Smart mouth nigga, Don't make me do ya"
Put my thumbprint in his high tech computer
My name came back with a warrant, felonies
Now they got me downtown, Spread my a***, buttocks
I'm like, "What the fuck is it now?"
They say I robbed a liquor store
They know where, when and how and it's foul
Got ya boy tore up from the floor up
Mom's in the courtroom lookin like she bout to throw up
It's a strong armed robbery, Strapped in the commission
Pre-trial conference, D. A. Got a proposition
He said you'll lose at trial
You'll get the 38, L on top
Take the deal, He'll give me 5
Half and most of the charges dropped
Hopped on the deal quicker than Flash
Sad, I admit that but two and a half ain't bad, I got get back
Sentenced me to five, Two I gotta bring
Only strike one, Swing batter-batter, Swing

[Chorus:]
187 on the D. A.
D. A. Aint tryin to give a young black n***a no leeway
Yes-Yes... Y'all
187 on the whole courtroom, Muthafuck 'em all
You better swing, Batter-Batter, Swing
Cause when you get your 3rd felony
That's 50 years you gotta bring
It's a deadly game of baseball
So when they try to pull you over
Shoot 'em in the face y'all

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm fresh out, Un-rehabilitated
Raided doin hella good and my P. O. Hates it
Hates d**k, She's a dyke lesbian b***h
Can't wait to violate for me for some petty a** s**t
I gotta get a job, So I'm fillin applications
Fightin the temptation of slang nation
Minimum wage don't get it
Five bucks an hour don't cut it, Raided aint with it
F**k it, Went and struck it rich on the dope sack
The homie gave me two, Told me to bring him four back
Now it's time for me to start havin things
Got me a coupe and painted it candy-apple green
It gleams, Clear coat sprayed on thickly
Fools out to get me cause my s**t is lookin sticky
I'm at the club and I can feel them suckers scopin
I'm knowin they plottin on me
But I'm still hopin they won't try me, Unless they wanna die
They'll be drippin more blood than Mrs. Simpson was
Sure nuff, Ain't a bluff, Here them suckers come
Got me reachin up under the panel to handle the. 44 Caliber gun, Ugh
Spun him around with a fat Magnum round
Got him on the ground makin funny sounds, Ugh
I got a problem, witnesses
Ten positive identification's

[Chorus:]
187 on the D. A.
D. A. Aint tryin to give a young m*******a no leeway
Yes-Yes... Y'all
187 on the whole courtroom, Muthafuck 'em all
You better swing, Batter-Batter, Swing
Cause when you get your 3rd felony
That's 50 years you gotta bring
It's a deadly game of baseball
So when they try to pull you over
Take 'em on a chase y'all

[Verse 3:]
I'm all swole, Five years later
Fresh out the pen, Loc'd up, I'm X-Raided
X-Raided Loc ready to have me a ball
F**k my P. O., I'm goin awol
They all can suck my d**k
I'm sick and tired of goin through all this b***h-made s**t
Got two strikes right now as we speak and peep
I'm not gonna let you muthafuckas do me
A petty with a prior will buy your fate
With Wilson in office, You gets no date
So I'm putting my belongings on Greyhound bus, Number 22
Headed to another state, Me and my crew
Unpack my s**t, Stack my grip
California and Pete Wilson can suck this d**k
If you already didn't know, You couldn't trust his b***h-a**
Look how he did Polly Klaas
Used her death and the family's name
To gain more votes and political fame
And it's a shame, I'm the one they sayin is a monster
Juvenile delinquent, Steppin out of sequence
F**k that, I ain't goin out like a punk
That ain't my style, Rip him from his a** crack to his nutt sack
Now they wanna kill a n***a like me
I blast one, Blast two, Strike three, Yellin...

[Chorus:]
187 on the D. A.
D. A. Aint tryin to give a young m*******a no leeway
Yes-Yes... Y'all
187 on the whole courtroom, Muthafuck
