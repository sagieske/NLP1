Song:

[Leader]
It's the way I came up all through the week every nite was a church nite
If you want to come around pack yo bags, cuz you must go there
C-soooooooou
And it ain't no shame it's part of my game it's even in his name

So if you call from the mall and you want meet ya
I gotta listen to the preacher first

[Chorus:]
Tuesday night is rehearsal Wednesday Bible study Thursday
I'm meeting with the band Friday Evangelistic on Sunday here we go
If you wanna go hang it might be delayed for me to get my praise on
So that I can stay strong it's all at church tonight
If you goin' to the game it might have to wait
For me to get my dance on
Might not even take long, I'm going to church tonight

[Leader]
Even when I'm at school it's running through my head that I'm so grateful
The reason that I'm so happy
[Chorus:] been so good to me
Wanna live my dream and have a bunch of things tell ya what it means to me
I truly know that I'm blessed gonna take for granted
I'm gonna praise him every chance that I get

[Chorus:]
Tuesday night is rehearsal Wednesday Bible study Thursday
I'm meeting with the band Friday Evangelistic on Sunday here we go
If you wanna go hang it might be delayed
For me to get my praise on
So that I can stay strong it's all at church tonight
If you goin' to the game it might have to wait
For me to get my dance on
Might not even take long, I'm going to church tonight

[Leader/Vamp]
It gives me what I need when I'm a little stressed out by my finals
C-all I do is lay it loose when I thank you
And when they hatin' on me cuz' I got it goin' on
C-It's what you can't really get at home
Nobody has to make dance or make me clap my hands
C- yea yea yea
Nobody has to make me pray or make me give him praise
C- all at church tonight

[Freestyle] I hated it cause mama hit me at the wrong time telling me I had a short time to get my hind parts down the stairs so we can get in the car which was parked in the driveway headedd for the highway I aint gotta sleep cause the people made unbelieveable sounds the keyboards under the sweet organ where the deacons and greeters were meeting and greeting at the door with arms open wide saying give me some more it's all at the church.

[Chorus sings]
If you wanna go hang it might be delayed for me to get my praise on so that I can stay strong it's all at church tonight
If you goin' to the game it might have to wait for me to get my dance on might not even take long, I'm going to church tonight
[X2]

Nobody has to make dance or make me clap my hands
C- yea yea yea
Nobody has to make me pray or make me give him praise
C- at church tonight
[Repeat go into fade]
