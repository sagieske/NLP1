Song:

My latest sun is sinking fast my race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past my triump has began
Oh come angel band come and around me stand
Bear me away on your snowy wings to my imortal home
Bear me away on your snowy wings to my imortal home
[ dobro ]
I've almost gained my heavenly home my spirit loudly sing
The holy ones behold they come I hear the noise of wings
Oh come angel band...
