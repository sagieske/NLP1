Song:

All we pray, alone we can't decide
Catholic in the morning
Satanist at night

Invocate the crucified
To hell he went by testament
Onward into war we ride
We raise the cross, the sacrament

In fire born, my soul is now divided... (tonight!)
My mind is torn, it cannot be decided now

All we pray, alone we can't decide
Catholic in the morning
Satanist at night

Agnus totus
Deus diabolu
Cantus nocturnus
Infernum aeternus
Hallelujah

Loyal side by side we stand
With blood we run the war routine
All we wait for your command
The son of God
The Nazarene

Hail the storm, the altar is divided... (tonight!)
The bible torn it cannot be decided now

Agnus totus
Deus diabolu
Cantus nocturnus
Infernum aeternus
Hallelujah

(Yes!) Catholic! (No!) Catholic!
(Yes!) Catholic! (No!) Satanist!

Warriors in the holy fight
And no, we need no therapist
Celebrate the wolf tonight
And proud we raise the metal fist

I heard the sound, and now I am enlightened... (tonight!)
My god is found, for all I need in life is loud

Raise your horns
The volume to the right
Heavy in the morning
Metal in the night

All we pray, for metal we will die
Metal in the morning
Metal in the night
