Song:

Can you feel that... That s**t
Ouahahaha(x2)
Ah ah (x3)

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken your servant I kneel(will you give in to me)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me(will you give in to me)

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes
Violently it changes (oh no)
There is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus:]
Get up, come on get down with the sickness (x3)
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up come on get down with the sickness
You f****are get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel (will you give it to me)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me (will you give it to me)

It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes (oh no)
The world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

[Chorus:]

(And when I dream)(x4)
No mommy, don't do it again
Don't do it again
I'll be a good boy
I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me(oww)
Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me(oww)
Why did you have to be such a b***h
Why don't you,
Why don't you f**k off and die
Why can't you just f**k off and die
Why can't you just leave here and die
Never stick your hand in my face again b***h
F**k you
I don't need this s**t
You stupid sadistic abusive f*****g w***e
How would you have to see how it feels mommy
Here it comes, get ready to die

Ouahahah
Get up, come on get down with the sickness(x3)
Open up your hate, and let it flow into me
Get up, come on get down with the sickness
You mother get up come on get down with the sickness
You f****are get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness has now come over me
