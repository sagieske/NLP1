Song:

First time I saw you
I didn't think you were special
But now I realized that you're the one I want to grow old with

I want to take you out,
I want to do everything right,
I'll take you to your favorite shop,
I'll even let you use my favorite coffee cup

Oh you, when you look at me,
You make me feel so glad
Oh you, when you smile at me,
You make me feel so nervous
Because you're the one I adore

I'll let you use my coat when you're cold,
I'd do anything for you
But now you're probably in bed,
Sleeping with one of my best friends.
