Song:

I feel lost, in myself
There's an alien in me
Who are you
Who am I
Blood is all I see
The words in the mirror
Are makinґ me shiver

Save me with your love tonight
Come and bring me back to life
(Alien)

I lay down on the edge
I feel my whole life on rewind
See your face
In the crowd
A million times
I'm drowning, I'm fallinґ
I hear myself callinґ

Save me with your love tonight
Come and bring me back to life
Save me with your light tonight
You can make the darkness shine

Come and kill the dream gone bad
Alien to love
Come and wake me from the dead
Alien to love
Need your love

Save me with your love tonight
Come and bring me back to life
Save me with your light tonight
You can make the darkness shine

Come and kill the dream gone bad
Alien to love
Come and wake me from the dead
Alien to love
Need your love
