Song:

Iggy says "I wanna be your dog."
But I want you to be a demigod

Look at my bow wow sitting there
Sniffing scratching without a care
Once upon a lifetime peroxide hair
What a heavy load to bear
What a heavy load to bear

Alcohol, drugs and rock n' roll
Come on doggy doggy let's go for a stroll
Before and after human growl so foul
And now animal and left to howl

A dog in Sweden, a man's best friend
Remember all those trends you set
And now you are a housewive's pet
Sit down bad boy, don't bow wow wow
Drink this milk from the sacred cow

Look at my bow wow sitting there
Sniffing scratching without a care
Once upon a lifetime peroxide hair
What a heavy load to bear
What a heavy load to bear

What no meat?
My bloodthirsty little bow wow
Hypnotised
Another family tree
Remember?
20th Century vip
You may have been a king
You may have been a queen
You may have been Nehru
I'm sure there were a few smutty little scenes
Smutty little scenes

Hey doggy doggy, hey doggy doggy
Hey doggy doggy, hey hey hey
What a heavy load to bear
What a heavy load to bear!!
