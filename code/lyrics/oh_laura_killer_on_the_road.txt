Song:

She never caused a big sensation
But she's a killer on the road
And I cross my fingers hoping
That our love can bare the load

But I can't take the picture in my head

She's a killer on the road
A fire going cold
A barrel of a gun
A villain on the run

So wake me up before you go
She's a killer on the road

She said she'd never been here
Yet I can feel her in the air
And maybe it's my imagination
But it's alright, I just don't care

But I can't take the picture in my head

She's a killer on the road
A fire going cold
A barrel of a gun
A villain on the run

I never she'd a tear for no one
I never changed my point of view
For no one but you

She's a killer on the road
A fire going cold
A barrel of a gun
A villain on the run

So wake me up before you go
She's a killer on the road
