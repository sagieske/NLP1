Song:

Dear lonely, you hurt me
You just came and knocked me down
That's right

Dear lonely, you tore me
Say hello, it's been a while
And now you're here to stay once again

[Chorus:]

Ohh
And I can't make you go away
So I'll just beg you please don't stay
Now filled with tears it's all because you're here
And there you go again
And there you go again
And there you go again
Dear lonely

I say dear lonely
Now are you happy?
Keep on messing with my life
That's right

What's the deal lonely
Come face me
Why'd you have to come at night?
You know it's not right

[Chorus:]

Ohh
And I can't make you go away
So I'll just beg you please don't stay
Now filled with tears it's all because you're here
And there you go again
And there you go again
And there you go again
Dear lonely

[Bridge:]

You're in my bed when I sleep
And in my pillow you bring tears woah
I can't wait for the day that you will leave
If I could only find a way to live in peace
You wouldn't have to take control over me

[Chorus2]

And I can't make you go away
So I'll just beg you please don't stay
Now filled with tears it's all because you're here
And you are
The rain outside, the wind at night
The time when I turn off the lights
Oh why just can't you leave me?
Oh when will you be through?
And there you go again
And there you go again
And there you go again
Dear lonely
