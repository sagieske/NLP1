Song:

When I think of home I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowing
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into meaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I could convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world has changed it's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing
Oh, if you're listening God
Please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe in the things that we see

Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay or would it be
Better just to let things be
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real to me

And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine
Like home...
