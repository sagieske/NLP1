Song:

Sometimes you feel
Like your work's in vain
When it looks
Like you see the sun
Here comes the rain
You try your best
To wear a smile
But you're hurting so
Don't you dare give up
You keep holding on

[Chorus:]
Be ye not weary
In your well-doing
For you shall reap
If you faint not
Wait on the Lord
And be of good courage
For you shall reap
If you faint not

You've been praying
And you've been waiting
For your breakthrough
But sometimes seems
Like everyone's
Being blessed but you
Sometimes you feel
Like God Himself
Has left your side
But I'm a witness
That He may not come
When you want Him
But He's right on time

[Chorus:]

Oh, they that wait
Upon the Lord
He shall renew
Their strength
They shall run
And not get weary
They shall walk
And not faint
So wait
I say on the Lord

[Chorus:]
