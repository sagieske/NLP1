Song:

When this world ends I will stop in my tracks and ask myself, what have I done with my life?
I have seen the lands In purity and watched the masses brought to there knees, I will not regret what I have done but what I have not done, tomorrow is too late, I live my life today.
I will not bow before the public, live inside the line, I am who I am, sworn to my ideals and when this world comes to an end I am caught in the middle of the waring heaven and hell I will stand my ground this soul remains mine forever.
As the earth crumbles and the sky falls time will freeze and I will come to see true beauty at this time between existance I find myself back waist deep.
You want to see us fail?
Not today mother fucker.
This world has every odd against us.
Im in between a warring heaven and hell.
I will stand my ground this soul is mine forever.
As the earth crumbles and the sky falls time will freeze and I will start and I will come to see true beauty at this time between existance, Many are torn apart but I will stand with my heart on my sleeve
