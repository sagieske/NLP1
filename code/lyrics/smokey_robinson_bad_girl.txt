Song:

She's not a bad girl
Because she made me see
How love could be

But she's a bad girl
Because she wants to be free
She wants to be free

She's not a bad girl to look at
Finer than fine
Said she was mine, mine, mine

But she's a bad girl
Because it was only a lie
I, I, I beg to the birds about [Incomprehensible]

It brought me out to find out
She was bad and my only wish is that
I wish I could make a bad girl to be good

She wasn't a bad girl, girl at first
So good at the start
But now, now we must part

Oh yes, she's bad girl
Because she's breaking my heart
So, so, so bad, she's breaking my heart
