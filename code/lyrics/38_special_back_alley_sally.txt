Song:

Back Alley Sally,
When you gonna come my way?
It's over here, bouncin' baby,
I been waitin' for you night and day
You got a crew all shook up,
How long's it gonna take for you to give it up?
Back Alley Sally, I can play your game

Back Alley Sally, I know I'm just a crazy fool
I have never never met a woman
Awoman quite like you
You got, I swear you got those crazy eyes,
Kind-a like to take a man by surprise
Back Alley Sally, I love to watch you move

Well I know you like to tease and show your stuff
Oo, baby, I'm callin' your bluff
Come a little closer, let's get on down
We'll drink my whiskey, tear up the town
Back Alley Sally, tell me what you want to do
I got to be back up
I got to leave here soon

You got, I swear you got those crazy eyes,
Kind-a like to take a man by surprise
Back Alley Sally, I love to watch you move

Well I know you like to tease and show your stuff
Oo, baby, I'm callin' your bluff
Now don't think I'm just messin' around,
You're the cream of the crop,
You're my kind of gal.
Back Alley Sally, is that the kind of game you play,
I got to pay your price if I want you to stay.
Back Alley Sally,
I got to pay your price if I want you to stay.
