Song:

Someday
This world will be a bettter place to stay
Oh, I believe someday
All our hopes and dreams
Will come to pass away
Chorus:
I believe that through(?) the sun has come shinin'
All the stars at night will agree
And when the mornin' comes
There's life and hope
Will shine it's way to all our hearts
I believe I'll see you in paradise
Oh someday
We will hear the children's laughter in the air
Oh I believe one day
We will have a taste of heaven
This world where we stay
Chorus:
I believe that through(?) the sun has come shinin'
All the stars at night will agree
And when the mornin' comes
There's life and hope
Will shine it's way to all our hearts
I believe I'll see you in paradise
Bridge:
You're free, can't you see the hope
When it charms us
Did you know that hopes and dreams
Can easily be foreseen
By those who's faith in Him
If you just believe
Chorus:
I believe that through(?) the sun has come shinin'
All the stars at night will agree
And when the mornin' comes
There's life and hope
Will shine it's way to all our hearts
I believe I'll see you in paradise
Paradise
I believe I'll see you in paradise
I believe I'll see you in paradise
