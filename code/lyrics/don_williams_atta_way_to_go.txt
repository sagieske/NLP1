Song:

Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go

Didn't you believe me when I loved you
I guess you thought we were playing games
All this time I tried to think I've known you
I guess I really only knew your name

Atta way to go you finally broke it off
Atta way to go we can't even talk or cry
Or even wonder why that a way to go

I thought you knew I lived my life just for you
There was just no price to big to pay
And even though I know I still live for you
The feeling's that you show won't let me stay
