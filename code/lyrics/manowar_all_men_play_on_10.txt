Original lyrics

I made a rock'n'roll sin
When I tried givin in to
Make money had to turn down low.
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud,
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin.
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute,
Get a haircut and buy small gear"
That's when I turned to them and said,
"hold it, right there!"

Well it's more to me than just a job,
And while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.
Nobody tells a man how to play,
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,
Can you hear me say...

All men play on ten,
Never gonna turn down again.
All men play on ten,
Never gonna turn down.

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220
Step back and let my fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear
There's a fire in your ear
That won't stop until the day you die.

I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream
Then I run back to the power rack
And deck all of my gear.

Well it's more to me than just a job,
And while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.
Nobody tells a man how to play,
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,
Can you hear me say...
