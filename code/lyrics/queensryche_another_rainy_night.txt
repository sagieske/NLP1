Song:

Don't slam the door on your way out
Don't leave without saying goodbye
Another long distance night alone
You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more
Last word today, coming home to stay?
Wouldn't that be nice, for awhile?

But now my take-out food is growing cold
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone

Chorus
I'm all alone
And it's another rainy night, without you
Guess I'll leave the light on for you
It's just another rainy night without you

Listen, there's a foghorn blowing from the coast tornight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears, without the pain
I'm not much without you, can't leave if I wanted to
Maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called

Chorus

Waiting by the phone, alone
And it's another rainy night without you

I know I said before
Hate the sound of the closing door
And your footseps walking away

But now my takeout food is growing cold
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone

Chorus
