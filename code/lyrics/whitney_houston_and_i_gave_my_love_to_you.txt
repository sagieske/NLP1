Song:

For the longest time
I searched high above the sky
To find the one for me
Sweet birds got in my limbs
And told me it was purely destiny
A few clouds came my way
And suddenly came the break of day
And it was you, only you
Then I gave my love to you

(And I gave my love to you)
And I gave my love to you
(And my rivers flow)
And my rivers, my sweet rivers flow for you
(Please don't tear my heart)
Please don't tear my heart into two
As I give my love to you
As I open wide for you

Sailing cautiously without knowing
That my reality will soon come
Strong winds brought me from my high
I drifted gradually from my ride
Touching down, kissing ground
It's you that I look for
Let's be two, my baby
As I give my love to you

(And I gave my love to you)
And I gave my love to you
(And my rivers flow)
And my rivers, sweet rivers
They flow for only you
(Please don't tear my heart)
Please don't tear my heart into two
As I give my love to you
As I give my love

Tender lover, blow your cover
Release emotions, for there's no other, but us two
Give it to me, and I'll, I'll give it to you, mmm
Discover trust in my sweet caress
Female sunshine and nothing less
Just the touch of my hand
And infinite want for my man
Yeah, gonna make you mine
Yeah, until the end of time
Mmm, 'cause I'm open wide with so little to do
Simply put, I live my life for you
Give it to me, and I'll give my love to you

(And I gave my love to you)
And I gave my love to you
(And my rivers flow)
My rivers flow for only you
(Please don't tear my heart)
Please, please don't tear my heart into two
As I give my love to you
As I open wide for you

(And I gave my love to you)
And I gave my love to you
(And my rivers flow)
And my rivers, sweet rivers
They flow for only you
(Please don't tear my heart)
Please don't tear my heart into two
Yeah, as I gave my love to you
Yeah, as I gave my love

And I gave my love to you
And my rivers flow for you
Please don't tear my heart in two
As I gave my love to you
(Yeah, and I gave my love to you)
(Yeah, and I gave my love)
