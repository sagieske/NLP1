Song:

How can I fight
These minutes are long
Tonight these streets echo like
A lover's song
All through the night
I've walked on the dark side of town
Sleep is just promises
Some vague reminder of life in your arms
I dream of you. I dream of you.
Everything you say.
Everything you do.
Makes me dream of you.
I want to hold hands
And fill them again
With real life statues of
The soldiers of pain
And watch as they fall
The Victims of Love
I am the one on my knees
Burning the candle of love to the end
I dream of you. I dream of you.
Everything you say.
Everything you do.
Makes me dream of you.
I know you suspect my desires
Are just a flame in my heart
You think that my love will go over
The first heavy weather I see in your eyes...
Oh no....
