Song:

She had good intentions and I had the same
She kept the baby and left me the blame
We both had our reasons but they weren't the same
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya?

We made a promise, we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers, then we were friends
Next we were lovers, now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya? But it did

I had good intentions and she had the same
She kept the heartaches and left me the shame
We both have our memories but they're not the same
Ain't it funny, the way love can do ya?

We made a promise, we'd never break up our home
Or ever find reasons for leaving each other alone but we did
Once we were strangers, then we were friends
Next we were lovers, now we're strangers again
Ain't it funny the way love can do ya? But it did
