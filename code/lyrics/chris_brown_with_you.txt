[Verse 1]
I need you boo,
I gotta see you boo
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight
I need you boo, (oh)
I gotta see you boo (hey)
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight

[Verse 2]
Hey! Little mama,
Ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure,
Yes, you're a winner,
And I'm so glad to be yours,
You're a class all your own,
And...
Oh, little cutie,
When you talk to me,
I swear the whole world stops,
You're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you are mine
You are one of a kind and...

[Bridge 1]
You mean to me
What I mean to you and...
Together baby,
There is nothing we won't do
'Cause if I got you,
I don't need money,
I don't need cars,
Girl, you're my all.
And...

[Chorus 1]
Oh!

And girl,

'Cause with every kiss and every hug,
You make me fall in love,
And now I know I can't be the only one,

Without you, there's no one left and,
You're like Jordans on Saturday,

Say you care for me,
You know I care for you,
You know that I'll be true,
You know that I won't lie,

To be your everything yeah...

And I...
Will never try to deny,
That you're my whole life,
'Cause if you ever let me go,
I would die...
So I won't front,
I don't need another woman,
I just need it all or nothing,
'Cause if I got that,
Then I'll be straight
Baby, you're the best part of my day

I need you boo,
I gotta see you boo
And the heart's all over the world tonight,
Said the heart's all over the world tonight
They need their boo,
They gotta see their boo,
Said the hearts all over the world tonight,
Hearts all over the world tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh! Girl!

And girl,
No one else would do,
'Cause with every kiss and every hug,

And now I know I can't be the only one,
I bet the heart's all over the world tonight,
With the love of they life who feels...
What I feel when I'm
