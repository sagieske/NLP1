Song:

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Ten little Crip ni***z runnin outside
All from the turf and they bangin out lives
Far from a scrub cuzz from the Eastside
Where they don't die they just multiply
So.. Don't give them ni***z a reason
To turn it into spray season
Don't give them ni***z a reason
Because they'll turn it into Crip season

[Snoop Dogg]
The gangsta's back, the bank is fat
The gangsta mack, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. Fools be like, "Break off some cheese"
Friends and enemies, aww n***a please
F**k, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laaaid
On ya back when the motherfuckin K spraaays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the s**t and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a n***a that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young m**********are it's like that

[Chorus:]

[Snoop Dogg]
Wake up in the morning lookin funny and s**t
F**k a honey dip.. 'cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah n***a, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)
It's like that!

[Chorus:]

[Snoop Dogg]
It's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, n***a we ride
And it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, n***a we ride
And it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside
On the Eastside, n***a we ride
And it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside
Eastside, yeah n***a we ride

[Chorus:]

[Snoop Dogg (singing)]
They say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun
I can't walk down the street without my gun, gun
