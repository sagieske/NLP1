Song:

Did I tell you it was wine when really it was water
I walked upon the wine it went to my head and I faltered
I've tried to heal your bones I've tried to tell your future
Maybe I should just call up some friends
And play some music, be myself
Well I've been thinking about what I do and say
To climb my way down this ladder, keep me from flying away
And if there's a preacher here will you preach the truth?
I want to know more about Jesus
All I want is You (all I want is You)
All I want is You now
All I want is You (all I want is You)
All I want is You now
Did I tell it was time to come and question nothing?
To look upon the sign as the answer to it all
Oh why do I feel poor?
Why do I feel nervous?
I think it's time to put on my God shoes
And do what I'm here for - raise the flag again
Can I be free from the chains of my religion?
They wrap around my head and they blind my eyes of faith
And I feel dangerous cos I hunger for the truth
This tightrope's swinging high
No turning back
Teach me to fly
