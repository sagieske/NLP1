Half crazy
Freestyle

Half crazy
Revived by freestyle

Know I haven't slept a week at all
Since you've been gone
And my eyes are kinda tired
From crying all night long
Know I've never been too good at cooking just for one
It's so lonely here without you darling
Come back home

'cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love

Know life hasn't been much fun at all
Since you've been gone
And my eyes being to feel
Each time I hear a sound
I spent every minute asking myself
What went wrong
Can't we try to talk it over baby
Come back home

'cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love
But baby there is no-one else
Half crazy
For everything you saying
Half crazy
No one else could love you like I do

(Break)

'cause I'm half crazy
Feelin' sorry for myself
Half crazy
Worried you'd find someone else to love
But baby there is no-one else
Half crazy
For everything you saying
Half crazy
No one else could ever love you
No one else could ever be

Half crazy
Feeling sorry for myself
And I'm worried you'll find someone else
Feeling sorry for myself
Half crazy (Faded)
