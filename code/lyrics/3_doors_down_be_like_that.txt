Song:

He spends his whole life being too young,
To live the life that he dreams
And now he lies awake and wonders
Why can't that be me?
Cause in his life he's filled with all these good intentions.
He's left a lot of things he'd rather not mention right now.
Just before he says goodnight,
He looks up with a little smile at me and he says

If I could be like that (like that)
I'd would give anything
Just to live one day
In those shoes.
If I could be like that (like that), what would I do?
What would I do? Yeah

Now in dreams we run.

She spends her days up in the north park,
Watching the people as they pass.
And all she wants is just a little piece of this dream, is that too much to ask?
With a safe home, and a warm bed, on a quiet little street.
All she wants is just that something to hold onto now, that's all she needs. (all she needs)
Yeah!

If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

Yeahee yeah oh ohhh yeah
Falling into this, in dreams we run away.

If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?
What would I do?

If I could be like that, I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes.
If I could be like that, what would I do?
Lord, What would I do? Yeahe yeah

Falling in.
I feel I'm falling in to this again.
