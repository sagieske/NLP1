Song:

Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true, yeah
And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
'cause we got a life of love
That won't ever change and
Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together Ooh baby,
I'll always love you forever (always forever love you) Ever, ever, ever
There'll always be sunshine
When I look at you
It's something I can't explain
Just the things that you do ooh babe
If you get lonely
Call me and take A second to give to me
That magic you make
And Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together Ooh baby baby,
I'll always love you forever (always forever love you)
Ooo babe x2
