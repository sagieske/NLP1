Song:

Beyond (Daft Punk)

Dream

Beyond dreams
Beyond life
You will find
Your... Song

Before sound
To be found
Close your eyes
And... Rise

Higher still
In this thrill
To the land
Of... Love

Beyond love
Come alive
And you'll find
Forever watching you alive

You are the night you are the ocean
You are the life behind the cloud
You are the end in the beginning
The worth of time is not allowed

There's no such thing as competition
To find a way we lose control
Remember love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul

The perfect song is rhymed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
You hold a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams
