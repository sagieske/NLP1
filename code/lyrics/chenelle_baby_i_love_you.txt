Song:

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I have found the only one, only one that is meant for
Me
You're always on my mind, I'll go through whatever
Me and you will ride into eternity

Baby we can go places
Maybe a trip around the world
As you and I look up into the clouds
I keep tellin' myself I gotta tell him how I feel
Inside
I guess I la-la but I keep holdin' back
Cos I don't wanna scare you away
Yeah, it's just me, so frustrated I wish I'd say it
Naturally
My heart is racing, cos boy I want you constantly

Me and you and now chemistry, huh
It's so amazing that I want it more
But I can't help but think that you have someone else
Don't wanna pay my mind attention this way
I try to block it out
All this time with you
I can't believe I have a doubt, 
I'm so crazy but you could save me
Baby, please let me know you're in love with me

(Baby I donno why)
I'm telling stories in my head now I can't sleep at
Night
(Baby you donno why)
Leavin' me tonight it just don't feel right
But I can't wait til I'll be seeing you here again
I'm trying to break my insecurities so I can explain
Everything I wanna say that I kept inside

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I have found the only one, only one that is meant for
Me
You're always on my mind, 
I'll go through whatever
Me and you will ride into eternity

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I swear you're the only one, only one
Nothing's gonna change
I'm always by your side, this is forever
Like the stars my love will shine next to your heart

What's all around me baby I don't care
Your face is all I see when you're not here
And I'm so surprised though I get carried away
I could lose a day from thinkin' you might not feel the
Same
But let me just say, I gotta turn it up
Cos it don't matter, maybe it's time but trust what I
Feel
And I just need your love to follow me
Cos now you know that you're my world, my everything, 
Everything

Now baby when I sleep at night I close my eyes and
Smile
And when I'm kissing you I feel my body light up inside
I hope you never ever think about letting me go
If I don't have you baby I would rather be on my own
What we have is so untouchable, unbreakable, and we
Will go on and on

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I have found the only one, only one that is meant for
Me
You're always on my mind, 
I'll go through whatever
Me and you will ride into eternity

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I swear you're the only one, only one
Nothing's gonna change
I'm always by your side, this is forever
Like the stars my love will shine next to your heart

We will light a fire if we're in the dark
And I'll be a fighter if we're apart
We can't tell what's comin' but I'm not worried
Cos I believe in us in love

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I have found the only one, only one that is meant for
Me
You're always on my mind, I'll go through whatever
Me and you will ride into eternity

Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I swear you're the only one, only one
Nothing's gonna change
I'm always by your side, this is forever
Like the stars my love will shine next to your heart

Yeaaayyy... next to you heart... baby I love
You... 
Oh yeeeeayyyy only you...
