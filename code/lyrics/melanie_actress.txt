Song:

You see she is the actress who plays the part of snow
And when they ask her to play Jesus ah she turned down the role
And when they ask her to play sunlight she'll give it a try
And when they ask her to play music she'll sing till she dies
Well she wouldn't die of pleasure, she wouldn't die from pain
She wouldn't die of starshine and she'll forgive the rain
And some say she whiles away her life in the lights that change her
She will not live for friends she'll die of strangers
She will not live for friends she's gonna die of strangers
And all her young men told her they liked the songs they heard
They loved the melodies but they didn't understand the words
And some say she whiles away her life in the lights that change her
She will not live for friends she's gonna die of strangers
She wouldn't live for friends she'll die of strangers
*Won't you lay down children won't you lay and take you rest
Won't you lay your head on you dear Savior's breast
Will I love you but Jesus loves you best
And I bid you good night, good night, good night
And I bid you good night, good night, good night, good night, good night
They're gonna eat up all the children when they wouldn't be good
Good night, good night, good night
You see she was the actress who played the part of snow
And when they ask her to play Jesus ah she turned down the role
And when they ask her to play sunlight she gave it a try
And when they ask her to play music her own sweet music
Well they asked her to play music and she sang till she died
Well I love you but Jesus loves you the best
And I bid you good night, good night, good night
