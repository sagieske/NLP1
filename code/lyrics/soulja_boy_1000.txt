Song:

Swag swag
Stacks on deck s**t bring
Money gang s**t ho
Stacks on deck boys
Young shorty

2000 in my pocket
Another thousand in my wallet
We do this all the time, we fly private
Yea yea we fly private
Number real n****s
Gold chains, and a couple mills n***a
Number real n****s
Gold chains, and a couple mills n***a
Flexin' flexin'
Money stackin' n***a
Flexin' yea
Money stackin' n***a

Off top n***a, don't f*****g play
Stacks On Deck boys, b***h yeah we in this thing
Money Gang, tat that s**t up off my armored ring
On my chain, fifty diamonds standing money bling
Ching, ching, I done cashed out like a jackpot
And I'm big dog flexing like Sandlot
In my hood, man we stack them shit's by four blocks
I'm turned up, and we get them by the C-knots
C notes, cut throat with my campaign
Fifty racks make it rain, make it hurricane
Young Dre, I go hard and I spit flame
Off top, money boy's in this thing

Money stackin' n***a
We flexin'
Let real n***a
Gold chains, and a couple mills n***a
Flexin', bublin'
Turnt up, money stackin' (1000)

Pull up to the party, it's time to have some fun
Standing on the couch, and I'm throwing funds
Stripper b*****s on me, it ain't nothing though
Do this every f*****g night, all across the globe
I hop up on the jet, it's time to cash out
I hop up in that Vet', it's time to smash out
My homeboy copped a Ferrari, so I copped a jet
I threw thirty racks on my f*****g neck
I pull up to the trap, to finesse
I call my young n***a and he hit the plug
Now we in the trap, pulled up off mud
I pulled up in that Lambo', skurt' scrub

We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing
Yeah we in this thing
We in this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
In this thing, yeah we in this thing
Yeah we in this thing, me and my nigga's in this thing
