Song:

Sixty seconds of heavenly bliss
One minute of your sweet kiss
Then my heart was all a mess
It's love - baby, it's love

Sixty minutes of you in my arms
One hour to learn of all your charms
Then my heart's like a fire alarm
It's love - baby, it's love

Twelve hours of you to tantalize
One day for me to realize
My heart flutters like butterflies
It's love - baby, it's love

Seven days - a wedding to plan
One week and then I begin
My life of a happy married man
It's love - baby, it's love

Four weeks of quarrels and kisses
One month of fighting the missus
I'm wondering now what the heck that this is
It's love - baby, it's love
