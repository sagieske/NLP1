Spongebob: I call this one, the campfire song song.
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song.
Our -c-a-m-p-f-i-are-e- -s-o-n-g- song.
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster than you're wrong, but it'll help if you just sing alooong.
Patrick: bum, bum, buuum...
[Patrick attempts to sing in the background]
Spongebob [quite fast]:
-c-a-m-p-f-i-are-e- -s-o-n-g- song.
-c-a-m-p-f-i-are-e- -s-o-n-g- song,
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster than you're wrong,
But it'll help if you just sing alooong.
Spongebob [quite fast]:
-c-a-m-p-f-i-are-e- -s-o-n-g- song,
Patrick!
Patrick:
Song! -c-a-m-p-f-i-are-e-

Spongebob:
It'll heeeelp, it'll heeeeeelp, if you just sing aloooooong!
