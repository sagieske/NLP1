Song:

Insincerity
Negativity
No Unity
Something's gone wrong
Thinking to myself how smart I am
Because I won't get caught up
In some dick's bad joke.
I'll just walk away
Fight it out yourself

BETTER THAN YOU CREW (x3)
Why even bother?
BETTER THAN YOU CREW (x3)
Why even bother?

I'm smarter cause I joined the crew
And I'm better than those who
Are picking fights
And violating my rights
You can always be the one
To end up on the top
Keep your standards high
Set your goals and never stop
This world of ours is fine and
Our future can be great
If you use our heads not our fists
We can wipe out all the hate
BETTER THAN YOU CREW (x3)
Why even bother?
BETTER THAN YOU CREW (x3)
