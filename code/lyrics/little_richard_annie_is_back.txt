Song:

Well it's Friday evening about a half past five,
Wait a minute here I can't believe my eyes,
I looked up yonder by the railroad track,
There goes Annie in a brand new Cadillac,

Annie is back, back, back,
In a brand new Cadillac,
Annie is back, back, back,
In a brand new Cadillac,
Now she's lookin' good,
Now she'll know how to act.

She says Flat Foot Henry was my sturdy dad,
But he put me down when things went bad,
But now I'm back and I must be keen,
I'm dressed up now and no dirty dirty jean,
Annie is back, back, back, ...

Well she went to get a soda turned everybodys eyes,
Says Flat Foot Fannie, she's been tellin' lies,
She says I'm back and I'll make them true,
If you don't watch out, I'm gonna take Henry, too,
Annie is back, back, back, ...
Now I'm lookin' good,
Now she'll know how to act.
