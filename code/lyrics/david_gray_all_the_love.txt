Song:

Hear the warning
Read the sign
Written here
Between the lines
Whispering poison valentines
To the love in me

Pull the blade out
From the fire
Crucify my own desire
Chase it off
Down to the wire
For the love in me

Milk of kindness
Bread of dreams
Belly's bursting at the seams
Cigarettes and magazines
For the love in me

Through it all
This heart of mine
Leaving me so far behind

All this world
Just made of breath
Every line get's done to death
Nothing here to face it with
Except the love in me

Through it all
This heart of mine
Leaving me so far behind

Meet me darling
On the steps
Paint the line upon your lips
Open with
Your fingertips
All the love in me
All the love in me
All the love in me
