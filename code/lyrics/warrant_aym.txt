Song:

Generation X
We are complex
Angst is the perfect wave
Ride it and be well paid
It all sucks, oh by the way
I wrote a new song today
So upset with all I have
And the world is such a drag
I've become my own cliche

Chorus
I am an angry young man
I am an angry young man
A. Y. M an angry man

Repeate the past
It's a gas, gas, gas
Make all the same mistakes
That all my heros made
Pretend that I hate fame
How dare you misspell my name?!
Hurts so bad, I have to fix
Apology read by some chick
Another million in the bag
