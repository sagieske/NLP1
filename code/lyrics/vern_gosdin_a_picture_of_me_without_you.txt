Song:

Imagine a world where no music was played
And think of a church with nobody praying
If you; ve ever looked up at a sky without no roof
Then you've seen a picture of me without you.

Oh, have you walked through a garden where nothin' was grown
Or stood by a river where nothin' was flowin'
If you've seen rose bud that were kissed by the dew
Then you've seen a picture of me without you.
