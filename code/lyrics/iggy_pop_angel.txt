Song:

Still when I was crying
You were on my side
Angel, you can come and see me here tonight
Angel, of course you're always more than welcome here
Still I'm needing somebody else... again.

Writings up my place
There is nothing much I want to do about it
The way I fall without you
The way I'm dull without you
I split my score, offer you love.

Still when I was crying
You were on my side
Angel, I never thought that I'd be free or clear
Angel, except for you, I doubt that I'd be here
Still I'm needing somebody else... again.
Still I'm needing somebody else... again.
