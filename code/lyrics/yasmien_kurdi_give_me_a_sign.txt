Song:

As I look into your eyes I finally realized
That I have this different feeling inside
And always try to hide
It's hard to let you show what I feel for you is true
And afraid you might not feel the same way too

[Chorus:]
Just give me a sign
A smile for you will be just fine
Just give me a sign
I'm afraid you run out of time
If you can't express your feelings
Then it's hard for you to do
Just give me a sign and I'll let it sure
That you'll be mine

Everytime you pass me by I close my eyes
Imagining what I'm telling you
What I feel inside for you
But it's hard to let show
What I feel for you is true
And afraid you might not feel
The same way too

[Repeat Chorus 2x]

Just give me a sign and I'll let it sure
That you'll be mine
