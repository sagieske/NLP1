Song:

As diehard as they come

Some of us have a grateful day
When harmony fades and life stands still
Those who are willing to sacrifice
Were blessed with the instinct to survive

This is for those who escaped the torment
You know your courage
You're as diehard as they come

This is for those who never waiverd
You are feeling
You're as diehard as they come

You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come

Never waiver, never falter
Remain diehard

You are as diehard as they come
You are as diehard as they come
