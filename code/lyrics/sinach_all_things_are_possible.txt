Song:

The spirit of the Lord is moving
Here with His power, anointing and grace
There is glory there is favor
This is the hour
Time to arise

And be blessed
Be changed
For the time is now
[2x]

All things are possible
When we call in his name
All things are possible
In Jesus name
Mountains will crumble
Chains shall be broken
All things are possible
In Jesus name

It doesn’t matter what you’re going through
It doesn’t matter how far you’ve gone
God’s arms are always open wide
All you need is to believe
To believe
