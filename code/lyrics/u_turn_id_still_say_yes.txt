Song:

I love you most
When we share a phase
Of special good times together
It seems like our love can't get much better (No....)

Coz we were as close as two could be
' knew love could last forever
We're more than just lovers
We're good friends

[refrain 1]
And even if our love could drift away
I wouldn't even think twice
If I wanted love back again

[Chorus:]
Because I'd still say yes to you again
My Darlin' for you, I do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I do it over and over again (Say yes.. Oh-oh)

Where does it go
How does it end
True love it seems so easy
'coz we have no doubts
Where we belong

[refrain 2]
They say time can heal a broken heart
And true love never ends
So why not start where we begin

[Chorus:]
Because I'd still say yes to you again
My Darlin' for you, I do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I do it over and over again (Say yes.. Oh-oh)

Say yes
Over and over...ohhh
Say yes...ohh

[refrain 2]
They say time can heal a broken heart
And true love never ends
So why not start where we begin

[Chorus:]
Because I'd still say yes to you again
My Darlin' for you, I do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I do it over and over again (Say yes.. Oh-oh)

Over and over...
Say yes...say yes to me baby...

Say yes to you again
My Darlin' for you, I do it over and over again.
Say yes.....
