Song:

Cruising when the sun goes down
Across the sea
Searching for, something inside of me

I would find all the lost pieces
Hardly feel, deep and real
I was blinded now I see

Hey hey hey you're the one
Hey hey hey you're the one
Hey hey hey I can't live without you

Take me to your place
Where our hearts belong together
I will follow you
You're the reason that I breathe

I'll come running to you
Fill me with your love forever
I'll promise you one thing
That I would never let you go
'Cause you are my everything

You're the one, you're my inspiration
You're the one, kiss, you're the one
You're the light that would keep me safe and warm
You're the one, kiss, you're the one

Like the sun goes down, coming from above all
To the deepest ocean and highest mountain
Deep and real deep I can see now
