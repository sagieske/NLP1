Song:

[Computerized voice]

My heart goes Boum-Boum-Boum
Every time I think of you
Inside it's Boum-Boum-Boum
Lost control what shall I do?

'Cause I wanna be your lover
Till the end of our lives
I could never miss again
These loving eyes

Ohhhh Boum-Boum-Boum

My heart goes Boum-Boum-Boum
Every time I think of you
I feel that Boum-Boum-Boum
No control of what I'll do

Simplicity, complexity, oh, what a tragedy
Reality, insanity, strange normality
Incredible, untouchable, but just visual
And I want you, just you

Ohhhh Boum-Boum

[Computerized voice]

Ohhhh

My heart goes Boum-Boum-Boum
When any mind is touching you
I'm going Boum-Boum-Boum
Only light inside my gloom

'Cause I wanna be your lover ('Cause I wanna be your lover)
Till the end of our lives (Till the end of our lives)
I could never miss again
These loving eyes

Boum-Boum

[Computerized voice]

[x4]
(My heart goes)
(My heart goes Boum-Boum-Boum)

[Computerized voice fades out]
