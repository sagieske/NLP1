Song:

(Tj Mccloud, A. Colby)

Flyin a kite again
In the February wind
I can almost see you beside me
Like it was back then

As the unseen hands
Lead this blackbird in it's sands
I can remember how I felt back then
With this kite string in our hands

I was soaring I was flying,
Knowing I had no boundaries
With the heights that now surround
But I was tethered, I was falling
Knowing everything that goes up must come down

Taste your kiss again
Feel the chill bumps on our skin
The spring grass under our feet
Leaves us laughing in the wind
You gave me the sky
Made me feel I could fly
Set me free from dirty earth
And I'll never know just why

[Chorus:]

I was soaring I was flying,
Knowing I had no boundaries
With the heights that now surround
But I was tethered, Now I'm falling
Knowing everything that goes up must come down
