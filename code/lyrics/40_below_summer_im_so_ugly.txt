Song:

Cause I'm a sideshow freak - a long legged geek
Gonna be feeling the flames and feel the heat of my pain
Now I know everybody hates me -
Tries to fake me and tries to degrade me
Ain't shit, never gonna be shit -
And I don't give a shit - not one little bit
Oh please, just shut the fuck up -
Why the hell are you so stuck up
Oh please, just leave me be -
I know but I can't believe that
I'm so ugly - nobody wants me -
I'm so ugly that nobody ever wants to touch me
I'm so ugly - nobody wants me -
I'm so ugly that nobody ever wants me
I shouldn't kill, but I will if I must -
I'm going off and I'm about to bust
In the dark - can't find my way -
And I wake up to it every single day
But I'll keep moving on -
Singing that same old song - Yo, I gotta be strong
I'll keep moving on -
Singing that same old song - for how long
Don't ya know that my life's killing me -
Don't ya know from before that I still bleed
Why can't you set me free -
You'll always see that
I'm so ugly - nobody wants me -
I'm so ugly that nobody ever wants to touch me
I'm so ugly - nobody wants me -
I'm so ugly that nobody ever me
Shut the fuck up - sit your ass down
It's my time bitch - eat your heart out [x2]
Shut the fuck up - sit your ass down
It's my time now eat your fucking heart out [x2]
I'm just one ugly mother fucker [x4]
I'm so ugly [x4]
