Song:

You say you've found somebody new but that won't stop my loving you
I just can't let you walk away forget the love I have for you
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
How can you leave without regret am I that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure you find you want his love much more than mine
Then I'll just say we've never met if I'm that easy to forget
[ steel ]
Yes I could find somebody too but I don't want no one but you
I couldn't leave without regret you're not that easy to forget
Before you leave be sure...
