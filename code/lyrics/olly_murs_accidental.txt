Song:

I'm always at the place where your friends meet
It's the long way home but I walk your street
And when I trip and fall right at your feet
It's not accidental

I make it feel like luck is in the air
Every time you turn I'm standing there
You look into the stars, our names are clear
It's not accidental

And when you get a wrong number
Don't hang up to soon
Stop and wonder

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
When you're in my arms then you will see
It wasn't accidental

I know you like the kind of clothes I wear
Think I threw them on without a care
The style's from a book you read
A magazine you left
It's not coincidental

And even when you hear your favourite song
You don't know but I put it on
You bought the record yesterday
So I knew what to play
It's not coincidental

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental

This all feels right time, right place
Cos every time I see you face to face
Our future calls
Not saying you bend the truth
Just doing my best to get to you
Made you my destiny

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental

You are the one that's meant for me
I'm twisting fate to make believe
It's all accidental
This was always meant to be
And when your in my arms you will see
It wasn't accidental
