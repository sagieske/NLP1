Song:

[Intro:]
This is called a Song 2 You

[Verse:]
I don't wear designer clothes
I don't go to the finest schools
But, I know I ain't no fool baby
I may not be a star
I'm not driving the sickest car
But, I know I can make you happy baby
I don't know what you been used to
Never been with a girl like you
But, I can give you a love that's true to
Your heart, not material things

[Chorus:]
I'll give you my song
These words to you
Sing you what I feel
My soul is true.
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl,
But all that I can do (All that I can do)
Is give this song to you

Nah Nah
Nah Nah
Nah Nah

[Verse 2:]
Yeah I know that you are blessed
But there's something you're missing yet
Your own melody... Oh baby
I don't know what you been used to
Never been with a girl like you
But, I can give you a love that's true too
Your heart, not material things

[Chorus:] (Victoria)
I'll give you my song
These words to you
Sing you what I feel
My soul is true (My soul is true)
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl (can't give it too you girl)
But all that I can do (All that I can do)
Is give this song to you

[Bridge:]
I'll give you my heart, my song, my words baby (Give this song to you)
What I can say, I'll sing it. (Give this song to you)
Oh, Oooh, Oooooh (Give this song to you)
I'll give my song an the rest to you baby, baby
Sing you what I feel, my soul is true

[Chorus:]
I'll give you my song (Song)
These words to you (Words)
Sing you what I feel (Yeahh)
My soul is true x2
I don't have the world
Can't give it to you girl
But all that I can do (All that I can do)
Is give this song to you
