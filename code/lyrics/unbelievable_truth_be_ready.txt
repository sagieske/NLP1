Song:

I never wanted you to be
Another substitute for me.
Be ready to go.
Be ready to go.
And now the nights are thickening,
Another place is beckonin
This house isn't our own house.
These thoughts are mine.
And all the hours we spend alone
We never make it out of bed.
Be ready to go.
Be ready to go.
Be ready to go.
I know that you will understand.
