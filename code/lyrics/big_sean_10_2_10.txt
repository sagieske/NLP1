Song:

[Intro:]
Imma be paid forever
I look up
Finally Famous n***a

[Hook:]
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10, then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boosts my adrenaline

[Verse:]
All this bread can't be too good for my cholesterol
Don't come round talking loudly, fuckin up my repertoire dawg
I can't like bruh lately I've been stressin heavily
I'm sippin, poppin, smokin on whatever take the pressure off
You b***h you, F. F. Imperial to my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material
Till I'm dead, I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of ya
And not what's in the peripheral, let's go!

[Bridge:]
Word
Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama
Over comma on comma
I'm bringin home dead pres
My house done feel like it's haunted
I put the city on my back
Right along with my garments
Went to sleep snoring

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I got three jobs like I'm Jamaican oh
I need three wives like I was Haitian oh
One cook, one clean, the other pmsing
"No habla ingles", if police have questions they don't know what that mean n***a
They say Detroit going through the great depression still
It's been depressed so long boy I can't even tell the pressure here
My home boys still gon pull up on them rims big as a ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh! A primo, top spot redeem code, for who?
My team and we might take a trip to Jamaica Montego
P***y and flamingo
Got me thinkin "fuck I need to sleep for?" Huh?

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Ay let me get the uh
Lil b***h
