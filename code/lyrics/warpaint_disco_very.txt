Song:

I've got a friend with a melody that will kill
She will eat you alive
Like cyanide it's poison
She'll eat you alive
Don't you battle we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two
Don't you battle we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two
Don't you battle we'll kill you
We'll rip you up and tear you in two

Only in the sound of the voices I scream

I'm an angel don't tell me what I did
You saw me standin' on my own mountain
? Not to put it longer
Tears are not worth their weight
Your love faded is over?
Your another one in a long long time
Wrestling people for peace
Wrestling people for peace

Only in the sound of the voices I scream (x3)

I make room for everyone
I make room for everyone
I need to take a break

If you had to go where I was not looking out
It won't happen anymore but look what I found
I was always talking too much
Only in the sound of the voices I scream
Only in the sound of the voices I scream
