Song:

I took chance, I took a fall
Waited on love 'til I could give it my all
Then I let my heart fly

Took a rose to her door
Stood there like a statue just sort of frozen by her presence
But I shyed (not sure of this line...)

Chorus:
Ain't it always that way
When you want to believe
Ain't it always that way
When you want and you need
Ain't it always that way
When you want to rely
Ain't it always that way
When you want and you need and you cry

Yes and then I took a space out of time
I don't wanna sound like a thief but the moment was mine and I stole it, it felt right

I took a chance, took a fall
Waited on love until I could give it my all
Then I let my heart fly

Chorus

Ain't it always that way
When you want to believe
Ain't it always that way
When you want and you need and you cry
