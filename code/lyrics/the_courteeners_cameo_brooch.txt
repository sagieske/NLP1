Song:

With your mother's cameo brooch
Sat at the foot of her bed taking notes

You watched her since you were small
You are the new belle of the ball

With your father's bruise on your arm
Telling me it's no cause for alarm
Stop pushing people away
You can't live your life this way

I will always be there for you
Whenever you need me, someone to talk to

With your sister's love for her dad
You tell her it's the piano teacher that has been bad
You said you hadn't learnt your scales
She said you were going off the rails

But that was nothing to what you are now
And I'm not picking holes and I don't want to row

But people are getting scared
We can see your bones, and we were unprepared

I will always be there for you
Whenever you need me, someone to talk to

I will always be there for you
Whenever you need me, someone to talk to

I will always be there for you
Wenever you need me, someone to talk to
