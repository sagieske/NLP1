Song:

I know
I know what's on your mind

And I know it gets tough sometimes.
But you can give it one more try to find a reason why

You should pick it up and try it again.
'Cause it's all right - I think we're gonna make it.
I think it might just work out this time. I

It's all right - I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time.
It's all right - I think we're gonna make
I think it might just work out

'Cause it's not too late for that - too late for me.
I know I've been hurt before

And I know I really shouldn't give any more.
But this time
This time things seem just a little different.
And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true.
And I hear you say:
It's all right - I think we're gonna make it. .. .
Just when you feel helpless
Nothing lefl to say.
Love will find us. The past behind us - then we're on our way.
Time and time again I see people so unsure like me

We all know it gets hard sometimes. You can give it one more try

Find another reason why you should pick it up

You should kick it up and try it again.
'Cause it's all right - I think we're gonna make it.
'Cause it's all right - I think we're gonna make it.
