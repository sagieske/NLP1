Song:

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little prayer for you
And while combing my hair now,
And wondering what dress to wear now,
I say a little prayer for you

Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me.

I run for the bus, dear,
While riding I think of us, dear,
I say a little prayer for you.
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time,
I say a little prayer for you.

Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me.

I say a little prayer for you

I say a little prayer for you

My darling believe me, (believe me)
For me there is no one but you!
Please love me too
I'm in love with you (answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer babe (answer my prayer)
Say you love me too (answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer babe (answer my prayer)

Forever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, together, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me (oooooooooh)

My darling believe me, (believe me)
For me there is no one but you!
Please love me too
This is my prayer (answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer now babe (answer my prayer)
This is my prayer (answer my prayer)
Answer it right now babe (answer my prayer)
Say you love me too (answer my prayer)
This is my prayer (answer my prayer)
