Song:

Two brothers, 1961
On a road 90 miles too long
Someone don't want us together but
We just keep on walking cause we're one, we're one

I got a voice and you got a reason
For the glory we sing our broken song
Take a side and I'll take the other one
Two brothers under one nation

Wanna feel your love right now
Wanna see the night and feel the day
Ever try to touch somebody
90 miles away

But it won't be the same again (won't be the same)
No, it won't be the same again (won't be the same)

Third brother, 1989
Got through it, opened up the line
Stand tall, I'll follow you this time
We're all just waiting on a sign

Wanna feel your love right now
Wanna see the night and feel the day
Ever try to touch somebody
90 miles away

But it won't be the same again (you and I know, you and I)
No, it won't be the same again (to the ending, to the end)
I'll be with you until the end (you and I know, you and I)
But it won't be the same (won't be the same)

We're broken, we're battered
We're torn up and we're shattered
We turn back on each other
The moment that it mattered
The curtain is shaking
It's bending and it's breaking
And I'll be with you in the end (until the end)

But it won't be the same again (you and I know, you and I)
Can't go back to the way it was (to the ending, to the end)
I'll be with you until the end (you and I know, you and I)
But it won't be the same, won't be the same again
