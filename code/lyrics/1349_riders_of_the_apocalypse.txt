Song:

I ride on burning wings
With a blazing demon
We paint the night sky red
With the blood of god's angels
We piss on the tormented souls
Of religious believers
We rape the Virgin Mary
To create an Anti-Christ

[Chorus:]
This is the war of angels
This is the war of demons
This is the war of heaven
This is the war of hell

Burning angels falling
(Their) corpses littering the ground
We crush the pearly gates
Burn all heaven down
We quench the sun
And burn the moon
Remove Jehova
And welcome Emptiness

[Chorus:]

Walk through the valley of death
Smell the stench of decay
As the war is ending
They will curse this day

On this day Death walks the earth
Reaping all mandkind

As the sky burns we march forward
Crushing, tormenting and raping the world
Hunt down all survivors, living in fear
We ride with death so no one is spared
What once were will never be again
(Because) the horseman of death
Brings the world to an end!
