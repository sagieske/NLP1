Song:

Ain't no mountain high.
Ain't no valley low.
Ain't no river wide enough baby.

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far, 

Don't worry baby

Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

Cause baby, 
There aint no mountain high enough
Aint no valley low enough
Aint no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway, somehow

Cause baby, 
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

Oh no darling
No wind, no rain
Nor winter storm
Can't stop me baby
No no baby
Cause you are my goal
If your ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me
Oh baby! 

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

Don't you know that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Don't ya know that there
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from gettin to you babe.
