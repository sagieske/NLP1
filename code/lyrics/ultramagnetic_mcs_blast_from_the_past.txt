Like jenny from da blok, wot
Can't test we coz my crews 2 hot, whos hot whos hot, whos not,
You manz are cummin off da plot, ow much talent on da mic ave you got wot,
Coz wen I'm on da mic guna bus up da place gunna get da ladies shake da hips n
Da waiste, guna get you prange guna make you wonna say grace, never wear glasses
Never wear brace, I never walk round wid a mashed up face, hectic n breeza
Givin you a taste, hectic n breeza pikin up da pace, so c** chalenge we 4 a
Lyrical race,

Its da H-E-C-T-I to da C, I'm a lyrical dj so c** chalenge me, dus gime da mic n
Ill spit freely n ill bust you up on the m-i-c, easy peasy, like chilin in
Jakuzi, lyrical bombs dat I drop are like an uzi, who she? She wanna sit on my
Knee n call me sweetie but she goes on nasty n she smell like weee
