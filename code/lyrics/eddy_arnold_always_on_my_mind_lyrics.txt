Song:

Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't free you quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel the second best well I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind you were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should've said and done, I just never took the time
You were always on my mind you were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't die
Give me give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should've said and done I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
But you were always on my mind
