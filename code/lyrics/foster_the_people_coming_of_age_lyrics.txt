Song:

Well, I see you standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of death while I'm moving ahead
So I'm stepping away

(Ahhhh....)

'Cause I got nothing to say

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age

And when my fear pulls me out to see
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that I care the most
Just like an animal I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong I tend to think I'm right

Well I'm bored at the thing
And too tired to rage

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age

Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age

[Piano]

Feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
Feels like, feels like it's coming
It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
