Song:

i can't believe that you have gone away
i tried my very best to make you stay
all this time i thought
your love for me was real
and strong enough
to keep us holding on together

CHORUS:
it hurts deep inside
you left me all alone
why did we have to part
i can't make it on my own
but before you truly go away
just listen to these words i will say
that my love is here to stay

my friends have told me go on with my life
a life that i thought we could have shared
the fun we used to have
all the memories and pains
these feelings not easy to let go and to forget

(REPEAT CHORUS)

I have given all that i have
to make you realize
that you are the one in my life
in my life, in my life

(REPEAT CHORUS)

here to stay...
that my love is here to stay
