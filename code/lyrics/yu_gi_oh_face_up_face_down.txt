Song:

Welcome all my honored guests
To the utimate duel of the best of the best
At my invitation you come to compete
For the honor of suffering the final defeat
Isn't it grand what I've managed to do
By kidnapping those closest to you
I've taken their souls to lay on the line
In a winner take all duel for all time
Let's play the game
I'm sure you all know how
But watch yourselves my foolish friends
You're all in my world now
Face up, Face down. Attack or Defend
Face up, Face down. This battle's to the end
Face up, Face down. Stay on guard
Face up, Face down. Play your strongest card
My arena waits us all
I built it myself, it is just down the hall
I wish this day hadn't come so fast
You see I truly wanted your pain to last
Face up, Face down. Attack or Defend
Face up, Face down. This battle's to the end
Face up, Face down. Stay on guard
Face up, Face down. Play your strongest card
All your cunning strategies, all the tricks you try
Look like merely child's play to my Millennium Eye
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Your turn Yugi-boy
What's wrong now you look so sad?
Losing your soul doesn't feel that bad
Those you love have told me so
And soon my friends, you too will know
Let's play the game
I'm sure you all know how
But watch yourselves my foolish friends
You're all in my world now
Face up, Face down. Attack or Defend
Face up, Face down. This battle's to the end
Face up, Face down. Stay on guard
Face up, Face down. Play your strongest card
Face up, Face down. Attack or Defend
Face up, Face down. This battle's to the end
Face up, Face down. Stay on guard
Face up, Face down. Play your strongest card
