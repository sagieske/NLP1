And Imma lock it away with a kiss
Tell me baby can you keep this secret from your lips
And if...
And let me give you everything I got oh
Won't you let this (Won't you let this) G up in your spot

[Chorus:]
Let's do something new yea
Let me set the mood yea oh
It seems like he just don't know what to do
So tonight
