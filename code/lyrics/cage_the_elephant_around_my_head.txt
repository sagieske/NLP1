Song:

I don't know why
I got these feelings yeah
I just can't seem to
Get away from
Can you dig it

But you may never see it
No
You won't find it falling off my tongue
I'll tuck it down
Until I finally lose it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah ah

I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair
Do you?

Out there on the flip side
You know I took the long way round
Cause all I really am is
A home-made
Elevator

Blinded by your sunshine
Put you on a plane to old Paris
I laid cards down
On the table

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah ah

I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

Can't find a reason for these feelings
Clouding up above me
Cause God he told me, he said he's gonna
Send me something lovely
But even still I sit at times and wonder what
You're thinking of me
You're probably sure I lost my mind oh mind
Oh mind oh mind oh mind

I don't think it's very nice to
Walk around my head all night you
Got me tangled like a bread tie twisted
I don't think it's fair

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah ah
