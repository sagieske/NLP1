Song:

So another gun goes off -
Background noise
Two kids in a stolen car -
Background noise
A young man screams in the dead of the night -
Background noise
A family mourns by an early graveside -
Background noise

You hear the cries of the different sides
The bullet hits again
Take a look in anybody's eyes
Our tears are all the same
Our tears are all the same

No shattering explosion is
Background noise
A man or a woman's final words
Are more than background noise
The sound of somebody's breaking bones -
More than background noise
A mother's graceful words of mercy -
More than background noise

What the hell do I know -
Crying out for love
What the hell can I do -
Crying out for love
When every single child needs
To hear the voice of love
We all need a new speech -
The words of love
