Song:

Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
Without the woman next to me

Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This aint a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it
I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door 

I had no choice in this
I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
(I'll be better this time)
I will be better this time

I got to say
I'm so sorry

Oh I Promise
(I'll be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
