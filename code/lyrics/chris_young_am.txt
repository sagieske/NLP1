Song:

Everybody waitin' for the weekend
Gettin' off five in the P. M.
Wanna blow off a little steam and
Go cut a-loose somewhere
Folks start showin' up at seven
Order up a crown or a cold one.
Nobody buyin' rounds for no one
No girls dancin' on the bar in there.

But in the A. M,
They go from gettin' buzzed into wasted.
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
Spendin' what they spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole worlds a-sleepin'
We're wide awake in the A. M.

Leave around ten and you're alright
Everybody's cool, never uptight.
But if you stay longer than midnight
You might end up in the middle of a fist fight

Cause in the A. M,
They go from gettin' buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
Spendin' what ya spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
The whole world's a-sleepin
We're wide awake in the A. M.

In the A. M,
They go from gettin' buzzed into wasted
Might not remember what they're sayin'
Radio turned up and playin' loud a honky tonk station
Spendin' what ya spent the week makin'
Ask a little hottie what her name is
Hey baby, tell me, what ya think about gettin' out of this place and
Let me show you my Chevrolet and
We can sit and do a little star-gazin'
Get a little bit of a long time in
In the A. M.

Ay-yeah, In the A. M.
Ha!
