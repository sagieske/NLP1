Song:

Can you keep a secret?

These walls, keep a secret, that only we know.
But how long can they keep it?
Cause we're two lovers, who lose control.
We're two shadows, chasing rainbows,
Behind closed windows, behind closed doors.

*Chorus*
If walls could talk, oh,
They would say I want you more
They would say,
"Hey never felt like this before",
And that you would always be the one for me.

Two people, making memories just too good to tell.
And these arms are never empty,
When we're lying, where we fell.
We're painting pictures, making magic,
Taking chances, making love.

*Chorus*
If the walls had eyes, my,
They would see the love inside,
They would see me, in your arms in ecstasy,
And with every move they'd know I love you so.

Oh when I'm feeling weak, you give me wings.
When the fire has no heat, you light it up again.
When I hear no violins you play my every string.
So stop the press, hold the news,
The secret's safe between me, and you,
Walls, can you keep a secret.

*Chorus*
If walls could talk, oh,
They would say I want you more,
They would say, "Hey, never felt like this before",
And that you would always be the one for me.
If the walls had eyes, my,
They would see the love inside, they would see, me,
In your arms in ecstasy,
And with every move they'd know I love you so.
I love you so.
