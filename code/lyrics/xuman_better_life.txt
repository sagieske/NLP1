Song:

CHORUS
You came for better life
Your dreams are about to satisfy
You’re self adoring
You’re plans are so boring

VERSE1
When you want to
To believe in that time
You could draw all
All that pictures and signed

PRE-CHORUS
But
They keep their heads in the snow
They’re running unknown
They’re running alone
They keep their hands in the soil
They twist in that coil
They warp in that toil

VERSE 2
When you had to
To bewail all your toll
You could waste all
All amount of your dole
