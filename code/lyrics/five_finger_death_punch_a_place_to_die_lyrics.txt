Song:

[V1:]
It's days like this I wish that I, wish that I had stayed asleep
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be
The light at the end, the crack in the sky
there's no promise for release
No way for me to get away
And all I'm trying to do is breath

[Chorus:]
Searching...for something more
Searching...for something right
Searching...for a sense of clarity
Searching...for a place to die!

[V2:]
Days like this I really wish, I really wish I wasn't me
It's times like this that make it hard, makes it hard to fuckin' see
No light at the end, no crack in the sky
everyone ends up deceased
A life like mine makes a man, turns a grown man to a flea

[Chorus:]
Searching...for something more
Searching...for something right
Searching...for a sense of clarity
Searching...for a place to die!

[Pre-verse:]
Piece by piece, I slowly fade away,
I slowly drift apart
I see a different world, closing in on the future
Sorry to be so cynical but it's all I know
Piece by piece, I slowly start to change
I slowly start to change!

[V3:]
It's days like this I wish that I, wish that I had stayed asleep
It's times like these that make it so difficult to be
No light at the end, no crack in the sky
everyone ends up deceased
A life like mine makes a man, turns a grown man to a flea

[Chorus:]
Searching...for something more
Searching...for something right
Searching...for a sense of clarity
Searching...for a place to die!

Searching for a place to die!
