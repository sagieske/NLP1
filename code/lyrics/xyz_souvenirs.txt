Song:

Once I walked across the skies, 
Found a dream in your eyes.
And then rain came along.
Once I slept upon the clouds, 
Ignoring all my doubts.
Now I'm back where I belong

Souvenirs, 
Close enough to taste your smile.
Souvenirs, 
Where I'm holding you for a while.

Now the sun you blew apart
Left a rainbow in my heart
To save our promises
Now my future is the past
And I'm gonna make it last
In endless memories.
As I travel back in time
To play for keeps and make you mine
All I get is

Souvenirs, 
Close enough to taste your smile.
Souvenirs, 
Where I'm holding you for a while.

(Solo)

Fool I guess I was a fool
But love has got the rules
And destiny is wrong.

Souvenirs, 
Close enough to taste your smile.
Souvenirs, 
Where I'm holding you for a while, 
Just for a while.
Yeah
Souvenirs.
