Song:

A
I'll be your candle on the water,
My love for you will always burn.
I know your lost and drifting.
But the clouds are lifting,
Don't give up you have somewhere to turn.

I'll be your candle on the water,
Till every wave is warm and bright.
My soul is there beside you.
Let this candle guide you,
soon you'll see a golden stream of light.

A cold and freindless tide has found you,
don't let the stormy darkness pull you down.
I'll paint a ray of hope around you,
circling the air lighted by a prayer.

I'll be your candle on the water,
this flame inside of me will grow.
Keep holding on, you'll make it,
Here's my hand so take it,
look for me reaching out to show
as sure as rivers flow,
I'll never let you go,
I'll never let you go,
I'll never let you go
