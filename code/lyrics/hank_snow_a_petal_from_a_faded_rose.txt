Song:

Here's a rose from my garden
Where the bloom of romance grows
But I'll keep on a part near my aching heart
Just a petal from a faded rose.

Love'd be sweet in the morning
When the breeze of summer blows
But will fade and die when the wind is nigh
Like a petal from a faded rose.

--- Instrumental ---

Now our love is a memory
Where it's gone nobody knows
But I'll hold so dear as a souvenir
Just a petal from a faded rose.

(I will live with the roses
Where the sea of mem'ry flows)
And each time I dream
Then a tear will gleam
On this petal from a faded rose...
