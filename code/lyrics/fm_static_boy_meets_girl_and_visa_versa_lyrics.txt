Song:

There she was, 
Time stopped when she walked by, 
She's an angel of fashion, 
With her wings flown high, 
She's the queen, of everybody's social scene, 
You know what I mean?

She moves like royalty, in the flesh, 
Her hair blows perfectly, never messed, 
Think I have asthma, 'cause she took my breathe, 
Away... 

Let me tell ya... 

She moves, just like a rocket, 
Shooting through the sky, just to make you watch it, 
And fireworks go off, whenever she comes my way
She must have been sent, from another planet, 
To break my concentration, 
And change, my understanding, 
'Cause until now, I thought, 
That all girls were the same... 

Now she's comin' over, what do I do now?
Says she loves her Jesus, and she loves herself, 
Wish I wasn't wearin' this shirt somehow... 
It's too late now

She moves like royalty, in the flesh, 
Her hair blows perfectly, never messed, 
Think I have asthma, 'cause she took my breathe, 
Away... 

Let me tell ya... 

She moves, just like a rocket, 
Shooting through the sky, just to make you watch it, 
And fireworks go off, whenever she comes my way/
She must have been sent, from another planet, 
To break my concentration, 
And change, my understanding, 
'Cause until now, I thought, 
That all girls were the same...
