Song:

My immortal care is at stake
I tried to take
And give them, all I can
Thinking of those moments
I was theirs
Lost now to make my own mistakes
Taste of lies is all I know
Civilization seems so low
I was a man
Who thought he could
Play the role of god

Give me the hope
Give me the strength to go
Without them I get darker
Give me the hope
Give me the strength to go
Without them I hit harder

Caging mischief talents is what they do
They all go blind once I come through
I can cause such damage when I don't mean to
I guess I'm passive to your point of view
I'm on my knees
My lord forgive me
Bring back my ability to be
I wish there was
A better place
To hang my cage and stop this race

Give me the hope
Give me the strength to go
Without them I get darker
Give me the hope
Give me the strength to go
Without them I hit harder
