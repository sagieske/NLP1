Song:

I get a one-track mind
When I see you from behind
Black stockings and those sexy legs
It's drivin' me wild

Body heat gives me a thrill
Got a look that says you will
I turn around, let me check it out
Give me a sign

Dirty girl, hot on your tail
Oh girl, you wear me out
Dirty girl, oh, what you got
If you give it I can take it all night

Oh baby, I like the way you move
Let me lay you down in the groove
Heat me up with your bowl of fire
So easy to please

You got my knees shakin'
You got my seams breakin'
Don't go and let me down
I got what you need

Dirty girl, hot on your tail
Oh girl, you wear me out
Dirty girl, oh, what you got
If you give me I can take it all night

Dirty girl, hot on your tail
Oh girl, you wear me out
Dirty girl, oh, what you got
If you give me I can take it all night
I can take it all night

Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty girl
Only you got, only you got
Oh, you got what I want
You got what I need, oh so good

Will you take it all night
If I give it, if I give it to you?
Can you take it all night?
Oh you're so hot, oh you're so hot

Dirty, dirty girl
Oh, you got what I want
You know you got what I need
