Song:

I threw away the pictures of those better days in Dallas
But I can't throw away these pictures in my mind
She's a page of precious memories I've tried hard to turn
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn.

If only time will heal the hurt then this may last forever
I may never know how it feels to forget
Every time I think about her those old feelings still return
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn.

I've burned a lot of bridges in my time
But the one I just crossed over Lord, it ain't the burning kind
She's that once in a lifetime kind of love that never will return
She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn.

Oh, She's standing on a bridge that just won't burn...
