Verse 1:
My Friend, my King, You see the waves surrounding me
I fix my eyes upon You
And though my sorrows roll like thunder through my soul
I'll set my heart upon You

Chorus:
Call Your Name, I believe that You hear me, You're near
Me

Sorrows fly, shadows flee at Your coming
You can do anything when I call Your Name

Verse 2:
Then come what may, I know Your blood will make a way
I'll throw my arms around You

Bridge:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
(Repeat)
