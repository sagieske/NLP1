Song:

About an hour or more, when I go upstairs
You can read between the lines
I can make it to the top, but then I gotta stop
But I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love

In a day or so, it'll really show
Gonna wear me to the ground
It's just the way it goes, she keeps me on my toes
But I'm all right

And should I mind
It's just the wine and all this making love

And I can't keep still, gonna make a will
'Cause I'm losing all my hair
I try to make it seem it isn't just a dream
And I'm all right

I'm almost there
It isn't fair to wake up all this making love

I get pleasure and pain, it's a graded train
It's a wonderland, it's a ride
And the rumor is I'm told, she's really got a hold
And I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love

She'll be making me strung
By the tip of my tongue like a tiger in a cage
She got me up a wall, I'm slowing to a crawl
But I'm all right

I'm really fine
It's just the wine and all this making love

Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
