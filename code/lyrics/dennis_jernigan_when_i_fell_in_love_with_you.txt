Song:

When I fell in love with You
I fell hard, what else could I do?
You took the old and left me new
Then I fell in love with You

My heart broken, all hope lost
Cold and hard, ravaged, wounded, tossed
Heard Your love song from the cross
And then I fell in love with You

When I fell in love with You
You swept me off my feet
Washed me clean and made me new
In You I was made complete

When I fell in love with You
My heart embraced
What You already knew
When I fell in love with You

Sin had bound me through and through
With every failure the darkness grew
Your love fell down with crimson hue
And then I gave my heart to You

You were waiting, Your love true
Me, debating just what to do
My heart was healed when You broke through
And then I fell in love with You

When I fell in love with You
You swept me off my feet
Washed me clean and made me new
In You I was made complete

When I fell in love with You
My heart embraced
What You already knew
When I fell in love with You
