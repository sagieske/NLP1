Song:

Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue he
And she told me a story yesterday,
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said "fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side"

Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto
"today is the day for you to rise,
Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,
You're gonna rise"
And she took high over yonder

And I said "fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Forever I will be by your side"
