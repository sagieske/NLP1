Trees falling leaves come alive, watch them glide
Eyes come to life when you smile for a while
Tables keep turning now the full moon has been seen
Know what I mean

Tell you what to do baby - all night long
It would take me - all night long
Show you how I feel - all night long
I've seen you in the papers they say you play at pool
I think you got me snookered if we play your rules

Maybe you can't see the way to be sure anymore
I can't help feeling like closing the door
Images are fading and the thought of you has gone
Baby it's wrong

'Cause all I need is - all night long
It would only take me - all night long
To show you how I feel - all night long
They say you read me like a book then make the book a film
You can write the screen play I can't wait 'til then

I wish I knew what I could do
It feels like somethings overdue
Communications broken down
Still got me snookered when you wear your crown

All night long
It would only take me - all night long
Won't ya, won't ya give - all night long
Yeah, I've seen you in the papers they say you play at pool
I think you got me snookered no exception to the rule
Give me - all night long
Won't ya, won't ya give - all night long
It would only take me - all night long
To show you how I feel
'Cause you still got me snookered and it's quite unreal
