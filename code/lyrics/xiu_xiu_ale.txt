Song:

Shut up shut up
I wanna hear that pin pricking
Shut up shut up
I wanna hear that nail scrape
Shut up shut up
Up your insipid voice
Shut up shut up
Is that your glass heart clinking?
I want to go to bed every second
Wrap your arms around your kitty
She wont cuddle up to your disgusting feet
Shes not the only one who wont
The gamecube is on
Its tender buttons hide
Crazy is the place your gigantic fat body fits
Crazily it fits into any bed
Shut up shut up
I wanna hear that pin pricking
Shut up shut up
I wanna hear that nail scrape
Shut up shut up
Up your insipid voice
Shut up shut up
Is that your glass heart clinking?
What's done is done
It cannot be undone
What's done is done
It cannot be undone
What's done is done
