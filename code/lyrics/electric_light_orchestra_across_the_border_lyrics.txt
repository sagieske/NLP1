Song:

I've been workin' so hard, baby, tryin' to get to you
I'm gonna be there soon because
In the heat of the day many miles away
When the sun is beating down upon the main street

I'll be waiting here at the station
I gotta move down the line

They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done
You know I got to make the deadline

I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write

The Mardi Gras will be blowing strong
And the people dancing all across the city

I'm leaving here tonight
I gotta move down the line

I'm gonna catch a ride on the nine-o-five
I'm gonna ride the rail until we reach the morning
Maybe three or four hundred miles

I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write

When the wind is blowing softly
Through the streets of a little town and the music's playin'
You're waiting somewhere over the horizon

I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write
