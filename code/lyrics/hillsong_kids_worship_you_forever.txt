Song:

You are God, You are Life
I will worship You forever.

You knew me before I took my first breath,
And You know the day that I will breathe my last.
You're the Alpha Omega, beginning and end,

Forever to You I sing.
Into Your hands I commit my spirit
You're the only One who satisfies my soul.
You're the Alpha Omega, beginning and end,
Forever to You I sing.

You are God, You are Life,
I will worship You forever.
