Song:

If I had possession over judgment day
If I had possession over judgment day
Lord, the little woman I'm lovin' wouldn't
Have no right to pray

I went to the mountain, lookin' far as my eyes could see
And I went to the mountain, lookin' far as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman and the lonesome blues got me

And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Boy, I woke up this mornin', my biscuit roller gone

Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away
I didn't like the way she done
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away
I said in my mind, yo' trouble gon' come someday

Now, run here, baby, set down on my knee
Now, run here, baby, set down on my knee
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me
