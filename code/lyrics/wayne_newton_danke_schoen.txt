Song:

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for all the joy and pain.
Picture shows, second balcony, was the place we'd meet,
Second seat, go Dutch treat, you were sweet.
Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Save those lies, darling don't explain
I recall Central Park and all,
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess, that's not all.
Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane,
I can see hearts carved on a tree,
Letters intertwined for all time yours and mine, that was fine.
Danke schien, darling, danke schoen,
Thank you for seeing me again.
Though we go on our separate ways,
Still the mem'ry stays for always,
My heart says, danke schoen, auf weidersehn, danke schoen.
