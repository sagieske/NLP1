Song:

You tell me I'm a handful
But believe me I know
My worst audience is my mirror
I put on quite a show
Don't think you're perfect either
But I love you anyway
It takes two imperfect people
To dance a sweet ballet

Oh if you lost your way
And it drove you crazy
You would still have me
We work together you'll see
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears
I know sometimes it will hurt
And you'll wanna hate me
But we can conquer the world
Leave our footprints on earth
We'll put in
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears

I know it'll never be easy
We'll bicker and battle and drown in
Our own sorrow
But I know that it all will be worth it
If you turn to leave then I'll be
Shouting no no no

You think that you're my shadow
But you're glittering like gold
And when I take my mask off
It's you I want to hold
I thank you for your patience
But I am patient too
I'll hold you up when you fall down
Even if you say I'm rude

Oh if you lost your way
And it drove you crazy
You would still have me
We work together you'll see
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears
I know sometimes it will hurt
And you'll wanna hate me
But we can conquer the world
Leave our footprints on earth
We'll put in
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears

I know it'll never be easy
We'll bicker and battle and drown in
Our own sorrow
But I know that it all will be worth it
If you turn to leave then I'll be
Shouting no no no

Oh if you lost your way
And it drove you crazy
You would still have me
We work together you'll see
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears

Oh if you lost your way
And it drove you crazy
You would still have me
We work together you'll see
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears

I know sometimes it will hurt
And you'll wanna hate me
But we can conquer the world
Leave our footprints on earth
We'll put in
Blood sweat and tears
Blood sweat and tears
