Song:

I.
It's been quite a while,
You've really kept me wanting you;
You've got some style, so unique,
You're beautiful, so warm, so deep
Stay with me tonight,
Let me know the kind o' love
That will remain forever be,
A dream that had become reality.

Cho:
Ohh, lovin' you, woh
Is such an easy thing to do;
No, you never know
It's drivin' me crazy
'cause it grows and grows;
But I won't let it stop,
No I'm ot givin' up
Lovin' you, Lovin You
Just a bit too much.

Ii.
It's been quite a while
I never felt so easily;
Wonder how you broke my style
You're close to me I need you now.
Stay with me tonight
It's got to be just too much love
I could remain and forever be
A dream that had become reality.

[Chorus:]

Woh, Lovin' You
Just a bit too much...
