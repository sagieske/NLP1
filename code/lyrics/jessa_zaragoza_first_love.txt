Song:

Once in a while
You are in my mind
I think about the days we've had
And I dream that this would all come back to me

If only you knew every moment in time
Nothing goes on in my heart
Just like your memories
How I long here to be with you once more

You will always gonna be the one
And you should know
How I wish I could have never let you go
Come into my life again
Oh don't say no

You will always gonna be the one
In my life
So true, I believe I can never find
Somebody like you
My first love

Once in a while
You are in my dreams
I can feel the warmth of your embrace
And I pray that one day you'll come back to me

If only you knew every moment in time
Nothing goes on in my heart
Just like your memories
How I long here to be with you once more, yeah

You will always be inside my heart
And you should know
How I wish I could have never let you go
Come into my life again
Please don't say no

Now and Forever
You were still the one
In my heart
I believe I can never find
Somebody like you
My first love

You will always gonna be the one
And you should know
How I wish I could have never let you go
Come into my life again
Oh don't say no

You will always gonna be the one
So true, I believe I can never find
Now and forever
