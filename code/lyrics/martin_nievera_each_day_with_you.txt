Song:

Flowers for you, on this lovely evening
Though they have no words
They share my feelings;

As we walk along the avenue,
Pardon me, I just can't
Help staring at you.

When I look into those
Sparkling eyes,
If float in the air and wonder
In paradise;
You give my heart a source of
Inspiration,
Your beauty is beyond imagination.

Chorus:

You are the one
The only one I desire,
When we touch,
When we're one you light the fire;

The seasons we share
Hand in hand, there seems to be no time,
Each day with you becomes a Valentine.

Time must go on and so must we
Moments slip away to unlock the memories;
One day as we look back with
All this treasure,
Candle light that shines beyond before.

(Repeat chorus except last line)

Each day with you becomes a Valentine.
Your beauty is beyond imagination.

(Repeat chorus except last line, 2X)

Each day with you becomes
Valentine.

(Repeat chorus fading)
