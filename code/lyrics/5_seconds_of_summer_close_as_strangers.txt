Song:

Six weeks since I've been away
Now you're saying everything has changed
And I'm afraid that I might be losing you

And every night that we spent alone
Kills me thinking of you on your own
And I wish I was back home next to you

Oh, every day you feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time, talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Late night calls and another text
Is this as good as we gonna get
Another time zone taking me away from you

Living dreams and fluorescent lights
While you and I running out of time
But you know that I'll always wait for you

Oh, every day you feel a little bit further away
And I don't know what to say

Are we wasting time, talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

On the phone I can tell that you want to move on
Through the tears I can hear that I shouldn't have gone
Every day it gets harder to stay away from you
So tell me are we

Wasting time talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers

Wasting time talking on a broken line
Telling you I haven't seen your face in ages
I feel like we're as close as strangers
Won't give up, even though it hurts so much
Every night I'm losing you in a thousand faces
Now it feels we're as close as strangers

Six months since I went away
And to know everything has changed
But tomorrow I'll be coming back to you
