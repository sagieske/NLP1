Song:

Uh huh, life like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is.

Cause life like this
Uh huh, uh huh
That's the way it is...

Chill out
What you yelling for?
Lay back
It's all been done before
And if you could only let it be you would see

I like you the way you are
When we're driving in your car
And you're talking to me one-on-one
But you become...

Somebody else, 'round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me...

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this and you'll,
Fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And turn it into
Honestly promised me
I'm never gonna find you fake it.
No, no, no...

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're someone else
Where you are and where it's at you see
You're making me, laugh out
When you strike a pose, take off
All your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you become

Somebody else, 'round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me...

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this and you'll,
Fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And turn it into
Honestly promised me
I'm never gonna find you fake it.
No, no, no...

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're someone else
Where you are and where it's at you see
You're making me, laugh out
When you strike a pose, take off
All your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you become

Chill out
Whatcha yelling for?
Lay back it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you would see

Somebody else, 'round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me
Tell me...

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this and you'll,
Fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get
And turn it into
Honestly promised me

No, no, no...

Dressed up like you're someone else
Where you are and where it's at you see
You're making me, laugh out
When you strike a pose, take off
All your preppy clothes
You know you're not fooling anyone
When you become

Why you have to go and make things so complicated? (yeah, yeah)
I see the way you're acting like you're somebody else
Gets me frustrated, lifes like this you
When you fall, and you crawl, and you break, and you take what you get
And you turn into
Honestly you promised me
I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no...
