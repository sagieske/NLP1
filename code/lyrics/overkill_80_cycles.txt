Song:

I'just alittle nervous
Just a little back - off who you know
I don't think they deserve us
As they sit back, back - off, here we go
I don't care if you love me
I don't care it's about just who you blow
I don't have all the answers
I just want to know...
How low can you go
How low can you go
Go
It's just a lot of crosstalk
I don't think they listen anyway
I got hit in the crosswalk
Best be careful, back up what you say
I know you don't love me
But I know just exactly what you show
I don't want all the answers
I just wont to know...
How low can you go
How low can you go
Eighty cycles hummin' like a big twin comin'
Eighty cycles comin'. I know
How low can you go
Slow
Listen
Bottom out/ discount/ 80 cycles goin' south
Goin' wherever I go
Kick start/ motormount/ 80 cycles in your mouth
80 cycles comin' I know
Go to
Live free/got gas/80 cycles in your a**
Lower that I wanna go
Die free/ sacrifice/ 80 cycles pay the price
80 cycles comin' I know
Once more
Your move/buckshot/80 cycles slingshot
One thing I wanna know
Bad move/ dog food/ 80 cycles too rude
How low can you go
Your move
