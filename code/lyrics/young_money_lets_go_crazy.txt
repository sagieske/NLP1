Song:

Oh, so nice
Just so good
Dance to the beat, boy

[Voice:]
I want you to go crazy
Get up people now don't be lazy
All the fellas will chase thee
'Cause Indra is in the place to be

Ladies and gentlemen please take note
I'm not lying I'm trying to get your vote
I'm coming on strong as you can see
So everybody in the party, let's go crazy
Talk is cheap 'cause I need to rap
To make your body move and make your hands clap
And as for a job, I don't want one
But I get to help the people that's my number one fans
'Cause I'll get dizzy if you'll let me
People in my place, please don't sweat me
Indra's the name, rap is the game
Come on everybody, let's get insane

Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy
Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, cra... Cra... Cra... Crazy, crazy

Crazy in the house with crazy noise
Getting down with men, girls and boys
Time to party, and get you
Time to prove to you that I'll move with you

All rockin', body slappin'
I know you'll agree because you're hands are clappin'
I'll ram you, I'll slam you
Gonna let you know who I am, yeah
I'm Indra, the real deal
A super great girl, with s** appeal
All follow, won't phase me
So everybody in the party get crazy

Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy
Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, cra... Cra... Cra... Crazy, crazy

Ah, ah, ah...
Dance to the beat, boy
Dance, dance to the beat, boy
Dance to the beat, boy
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance to the beat, boy
Dance, dance to the beat, boy
Dan... Dan... Dance to the beat boy
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy
Let's go, let, let, let's go crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, cra... Cra... Cra... Crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, cra... Cra... Cra... Crazy, crazy

Oh, so nice, just so good
