Song:

Another night
I closing in
And I remember
All our feelings within
I did you wrong
And hurt you so
I hurt you so
(Baby don't go)
Baby don't leave me
Please don't leave me this way
(Baby don't go)
Please don't leave me this way

I've fallen down
From high above
And now I'm drowning
In the sea of love
I want you back
Here by my side
Can you forgive me
Everytime when the night comes
I'm waiting
I'm waiting
Everytime when the night comes
I'm waiting
For you
