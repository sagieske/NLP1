Song:

I like the way that your hair falls away when the night brings a candle to you
And I like to stare as you come down the stair and the light from the landing shines through
And how many fallen leaves will it take to believe that autumn has finally come
The weathers grown colder and we've both grown older it's hard to believe we're still one

[Chorus:]
Let's dance that old dance once more, still move as smooth on that old ballroom floor
I'll wear my Sunday best, you wear your favourite dress
Lock up the door, and lets dance that old dance once more

You hung around keep my feet on the ground when I acted as proud as a fool
We were kids and we've grown, we've got kids of our own Got to raise by the old golden rule
Somehow it seems, some of our dreams got discarded somewhere on the road
When all that was true could be found in the blue of your eyes that still sparkle and glow

[Chorus:]

The Frost King has come and with a flick of his thumb turned the windows to Renaissance art
As we sit round the fire with no need to enquire about the ways of the soul and the heart
Years passed us by like a soft whispered sigh not noticing youth as it flew
It's easy to tell that you wear your age well not trying to prove you're still you

[Chorus 2x]

[Fade]
