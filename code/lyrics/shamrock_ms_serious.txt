Song:

In My Dreams, In My Dreams
Your Face Is All That I Could See
But Is It Me? Or Is It Me?
The One You're Kissing, Is That Me?

I've Been So Blinded
But I Think I Can Make It
But I'm So Worried
For I don't Know What You'll Be Saying

[Chorus:]
I've Been Looking For You, Miss Serious
I've Been Waiting For You But You're Mysterious
I've Been Looking For You Miss Serious
The Things I See, Are They Ridiculous

When I'm Lonely, I Think Of You
But All I Can Do Is Shake It
I Bite My Lip And Have A Grip
But All I Can Do Is Fake It

Let"s Get This Started
Coz Its You Who's All I Ever Needed
I'd Be Delighted
If The Genie Would Deem My Wish Granted

(Repeat Chorus)

[Bridge:]
Don't Treat Me Like This
Don't Treat Me Like This
Am I A Freak? Am I A Freak?
Am I A Freak? Am I A Freak?

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
