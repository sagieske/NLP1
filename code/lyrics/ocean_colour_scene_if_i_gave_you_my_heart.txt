Song:

If I gave you my heart
Where would you be
Would it mean nothing
If not for me

If I gave you my eyes
What would they see
Would they see nothing
If not for me

But I gave you my hand and my sign and my soul on the earth
And I gave up on truth when I heard about the words
I lived out of love when I gave it away
And I sold off my soul when there's no one to pay

If I gave you my hand
What would it write
Would it say nothing
Or say it's alright

If I gave you my arms
Would they hold you tight
First blood [?] in morning
Or bid you goodnight

And I gave you my strength and my worth and I gave you my gift
And I moved on the first and I left us to drift
And I reap from the soil and I build hopes from wood
It's a new better life and we have to ensure

And I gave you my dream of the world and you stole the key
You sang to the wind in the whole? ?? Sea
And I feel my weight and I guard my soul
And I found my beliefs when I found my control
I gave you my hand and my soul on the earth
And I gave up on the truth when I heard about the words
So I lived out of love when I gave it away
And I sold off my soul when there's no one to pay

Another version
---------------------------------------------------------
If I gave you my heart where would you be,
Would it mean nothing if not for me?
If I gave you my eyes what would they see,
Would they see nothing if not for me?

But I gave you my hand and my sign,
And my soul on the earth,
And I gave up on truth,
When I heard about the worst

So I lived out of love
When I gave it away
And I sold off my soul
When there was no-one to pay

If I gave you my hand what would it write
Would it say nothing or say it's alright
If I gave you my arms would they hold you tight
First light of morning or bid you goodnight

And I gave you my strength and my worth
And I gave you my gift
And I moved on the first
And I left us to drift

And I'll reap from the soil
And I'll build home from wood
It's a new better life
And we have 2 and should

And I gave you my dream of the world
And we stood on the quay
And we sang to the wind
And the whole darkening sea

And I feel my weight
And I guard my soul
And I found my beliefs
When I found my control

I gave you my hand
And my soul on the earth
And I gave up on truth
When I heard about the worst

So I lived out of love
When I gave it away
And I sold off my soul
When there was no-one to pay
