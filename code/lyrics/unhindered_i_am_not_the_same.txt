Song:

You restore the wasted the years 
You build the broken walls
Your love replaces fear
Oh, your mercy makes us whole
Adopted, healed, and lifted

Chorus:   I am not the same I'm a new creation
I am not the same anymore
I am not ashamed, I will not be shaken
I am not the same anymore, anymore
(I'm not the same, I'm not the same Lord)

I bow before your cross this broken life made new
So amazed at all you are, Lord

And who I am in you
Adopted, healed, and lifted
Forgiven, found, and rescued

Chorus

You have overcome it is finished it is done 
Now my heart is finally free 
Every chain undone by the power of the son 
Risen savior, reigning king,  
(Forevermore, forevermore, oh you reign forevermore, oh)

Chorus

Every chain undone by the power of the son, I am notice same anymore (2x)
