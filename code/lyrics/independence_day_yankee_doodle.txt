Song:

Yankee Doodle went to town, a-riding on a pony; 
Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni.

Chorus

Yankee Doodle keep it up, Yankee Doodle dandy, 
Mind the music and the step and with the girls be handy.

Father and I went down to camp along with Captain Gooding
And there we saw the men and boys, as thick as hasty pudding.

There was Colonel Washington, upon a strapping stallion, 
A-giving orders to his men, I guess there was a million.

And there I saw a cannon barrel as big as mother's basin, 
And every time they touched it off they scampered like the nation.
