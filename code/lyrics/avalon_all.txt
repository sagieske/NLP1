Song:

VERSE:
I've had a world of possibities slip through my hands
& pray'rs that went unanswered that I couldn't understand
There's a faith that can move mountains but I never let it move me
I only trusted things that I could see

PRECHORUS:
So much frustration & trying it alone
I've had the revelation I can't make it on my own

CHORUS:
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
There was always somethin' missin'
Now You got my full attention
I give You my life, surrender control
O I fin'lly learned to listen to the call
TAG):
I give You my all
I give You my all yeah

VERSE:
There are moments in the journey where I wonder where You are (where You are)
& sometimes I forget that You live inside my heart (live in my heart)
It's there I hear You whisper "I've been here all along" (here all along)
& I'm in the hands of mercy where I belong

PRECHORUS:
A silent conversation when You speak to me (You speak to me)
Is the sweetest inspiration & all I'll ever need yeah (oh)

CHORUS + *DESCANT1:
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
There was always somethin' missin'
Now You got my full attention
I give You my life, surrender control
O I fin'lly learned to listen to the call
TAG:
I give You my all
I give You my all yeah

*DESCANT1:
Deep in my heart & in my soul
Lord I give You full control

BRIDGE + *DESCANT2:
Ev'ry thing I have to give
Lord I freely give it all yeah yeah yeah

*DESCANT2:
Ev'ry single day of my life I live
Ev'ry little thing that I have to give
Lord I freely give it, Lord I freely give it
Ev'ry single day of my life I live
Ev'ry little thing that I have to give
Lord I freely give it, Lord I freely give it all

CHORUS:
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
There was always somethin' missin'
Now You got my full attention (deep in my soul)
I give You my life, surrender control (Lord I give up control)
O I fin'lly learned to listen to the call
I give You my all

CHORUS + *DESCANT1:
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
Deep in my heart, deep in my soul
There was always somethin' missin'
Now You got my full attention (deep in my soul)
I give You my life, surrender control
O I fin'lly learned to listen to the call
TAG:
I give You my all
I give You my all
I give You my all

FINÃ‰:
I give You my everything
All my life I surrender
