Song:

All I think I need is
An affirmation of
An idea or an inkling
Of where we started from
You make me look like I sound like I'm crazy
Every time I see you near me
I feel ashamed I feel shy
Every time I see you nearby
I wanna scream and hide
I don't think I'm willing to impersonate
The normalcy that I'd need to get throught every day with you
You make me look like I sound like I'm crazy
Every time I see you near me
I feel ashamed I feel shy
Every time I see you nearby
I wanna scream and hide
