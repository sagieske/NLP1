Song:

Sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home
Sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna hear my milk cow moan
Yeah, sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna hit the highway road
Lo, then again, then again, then again, then again
Oh baby, I'm in the mood for you

Well, sometime I'm in a mood, I'm wanna back up against the wall
Sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna live in a pony's stall
Yeah, sometime I'm in a mood, I don't wanna do nothin' at all
Then again, then again, then again, then again
I said, oh baby, I'm in the mood for you, oh

Oh, sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna lay me down and die
Sometime I'm in a mood, I'm wanna fly right through the sky
Yeah, sometime I'm in a mood, I wanna laugh until I cry
Then again, then again, then again, then again
Oh baby, I'm in the mood for you
