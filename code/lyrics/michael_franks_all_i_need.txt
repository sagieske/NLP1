Song:

When I saw you on the beach I self-destructed
My well constructed
Counterpoint of cool.
In that instant I imagined us together
Hardly ever
Resting to refuel.
For forever you are all I need
More than ever you are all I need.
Every kiss perpetuates like mass-production
Sweet seduction
Haunts me like perume.
Everytime we touch I feel a deeper meaning
Hearts convening
Palpitate in tune.
For forever you are all I need
More than ever you are all I need.
Here with you beside me I agree
No mater where we are is perfect ecstasy
Our bodies speak some language too
Intense for us to comprehend
But when they do
I only know
You're all I need.
Poets say that love gives meaning to existence
We, for instance,
Prove that point of view.
I'm convinced our souls have searched
A thousand lifetimes
To find the right time
Enter me and you.
For forever you are all I need
More than ever you are all I need
