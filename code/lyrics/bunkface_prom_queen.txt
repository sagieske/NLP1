Song:

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever

Hey ho lets go!

Dressed up in your best
Your ready
To hit the dance floor
Tonight

Flash down the spotlight
Right on you
Everyone knows you
This time

And so I...
Can't go on

And I...
Want you to know that

Your cool your hot
You make me go
Oh oh oh...

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

Wo oh ohhh

Step back in the moonlight
Let me sing
I... Ll be king
Oh, in this broken dream

Scream out the words of the fame
Coz I'm in too much pleasure
Tonight

And so I...
Can't go on

And I...
Want you to know that

Your cool your hot
You make me go
Oh oh oh...

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

(She's no girl for me)

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

She's the prom queen
Top 5 in magazines
Where I go forever
She's no girl for me

Ohh no no no

No girl for me...
