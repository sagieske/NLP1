Song:

Act sleazy
Behave like a tart
It's so easy
To get what you want

Yeah
You can't get enough

Hey baby
We all know your name
It's s**
That will lead you to fame

Don't Don't Don't Give it up
Don't Don't Die of a broken heart

Your ego
Is never at fault
If you believe it
You'll get all you want

Yeah
You can't get enough

Don't Don't Die of a broken heart

I feel your pulse
Beating blue
And I feel your skin crawls
When we, we, we, we
F**k

Don't Don't Die of a broken heart
