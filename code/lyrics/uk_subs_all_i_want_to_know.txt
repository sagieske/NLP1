Song:

Here comes heart beat
Picked up on every street
She knows what it's for
Like she said she knows the score

All I wanna know, All I wanna know
Does she suck

See her on your tv screen
Prettiest little thing that you've ever seen
Is she good has she got a brain
I can teach her but it's such a pain

She's coming out of school
About to break a rule
Going out getting excited
There'll be no homework done tonight
