Song:

All I see before me are broken pieces, but in my dream I caught a glimpse of You.
Awakened by the sound I'm captivated, falling more each day in love with You.
Even now, I'm looking up to Heaven. Even now, You're singing over me.
So I come amazed by You, amazed by You, Simply amazed.
To look into the eyes of tender mercy, as they press the thorns upon Your brow. How can it be that You were thinking of me? Never knew such love until now.
Even now, I'm looking up to heaven, even now, You're singing over me.
So I come, amazed by You, amazed by You, simply amazed.
And I'm singing like it's the first time. And I'm singing like it's the first time.
So I come amazed by You, amazed by You, amazed by You. So I come amazed by you, amazed by You, simply amazed.
With all my love, I've come undone, simply amazed. With all my love for all You've done, simply amazed.
