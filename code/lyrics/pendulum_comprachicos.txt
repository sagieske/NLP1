Song:

Manipulation doesn't shape me
And I'm just feeling the part took out
And even though this curse restrains me
I got so many things to yell about

Well I could fight this
But I may die
And all I want is to be the apple in your eye
Well I could stay here
Strap on my face
Listen to the words that put me in my place

I have seen a transition
And you wondered what I'm gonna do about it
You thought that my eyes were behind my back
Though that I didn't want to but as you see

Throw it away
'Cause I got the patience
To see you drown
To watch you go down

I am the reality you wish you had
I war against your constant re-emulation
All that I strive for is to believe in you
Words that I hold true

Throw it away
'Cause I got the patience
To see you drown
To watch you go down

Throw it away
'Cause I got the patience
To see you drown
To watch you go down
