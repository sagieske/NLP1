Song:

I've seen the snow-white mountains of Alaska
I've sailed along the rivers of Peru
I've seen the world and all its Seven Wonders
But I've never seen a wonder like you

I've stood upon the pyramids of Egypt
Far away across the ocean blue
I've seen the island beauties of Hawaii
But I've never seen a beauty like you

I've gazed at the White Cliffs of Dover
There's not a place I didn't see
Now that my travels are over
I wish you had been there with me

I've seen the pretty dancing girls of Siam
The happy Polynesian people, too
But they're not as happy as I am
'Cause they haven't got a wonder like you

I've gazed at the White Cliffs of Dover
There's not a place I didn't see
Now that my travels are over
I wish you had been there with me

I've seen the pretty dancing girls of Siam
The happy Polynesian people, too
But they're not as happy as I am
'Cause they haven't got a wonder like you

They haven't got a wonder like you
No, they haven't got a wonder like you
No, they haven't got a wonder like you
