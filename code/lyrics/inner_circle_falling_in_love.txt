Song:

Wise men say, only fools rush in. But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin? I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows gently to the sea Darling so we go, some things were
Meant to be Take my hand take my whole life too 'Cause I can't help falling
In love with you

As the river flows gently to the sea Darling so we go, some things were
Meant to be Take my hand take my whole life too 'Cause I can't help falling
In love with you
