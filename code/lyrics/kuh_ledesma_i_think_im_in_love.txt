Song:

Is this love
Feeling restless inside
Wanting you to always be my side
I don't even want you out of my sight
You are in my thoughts all day and night
I can't get you out of my mind
I think I'm in love

Refrain:
I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love with you
Every single day
Every single night
Every single moment of my life
I want to spend them all with you
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with you
Tell me that you care
Tell me... Please
Tell me that you also feel
The way that I do...

Can't describe
Words are just not enough
Can't explain
It all happened so fast
What exactly am I feeling right now
If this is love I got to know somehow
Just how long this madness will last
'Cause I think I'm in love

I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love with you
Every single day
Every single night
Every single moment of my life
I want to spend them all with you
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with you
Tell me that you care
Tell me... Please
Tell me that you also feel
The way that I do...

I think I'm in love
Think I'm in love with you
Every single day
Every single night
Every single moment of my life
I want to spend them all with you
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love with you
Tell me that you care
Tell me... Please
Tell me that you also feel
The way that I do...
