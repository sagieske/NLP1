Song:

We are waking up in a pile of shit
The whole bay is full of it
And it keeps growing out of our ears
But we keep swimming in this wide oceans of salty tears

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

Down the central of your sensual sense
Freak more freaks now while I got the chance
But keeps on cool dubs, don’t waste the odds
The day is soon to come when you’re gone
Need it all
I say

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

Like leaves
That days are falling not tell me why
The breeze will carry for a while but it will fall to the ground
Please stay, life is a calling
Life not a waiting life is running away
But long after you’re gone, your question would still be answered
If you’re here, now you’ll be a god forever

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
