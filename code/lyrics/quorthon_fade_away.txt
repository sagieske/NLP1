Song:

Caught between the dusk and dawn
I numb myself to death yet I'm awake
I'm running out of alcohol
I shouldn't feel a thing yet all I feel is hate

This maddening pain keeps me awake I need to fade away all I feel is hate
I wish that I'd just fade away, fade away, fade away
I can't cope with all this hate, all this hate, all this hate
I'm so tired still awake, still awake, still awake
Finally I fade away, fade away, fade away
I pour another drink coz I can still think
And won't stop aching 'til I'm out of my head
That ticking clock is killing me
I wish that I was dead it wouldn't be too bad
I hope you're fine and well, I say
I wouldn't want it any other way
So please tell me how do you feel
Now tell me how's the league, tell me how's the league
I can tell I fade away, fade away, fade away
I'm stuck here just like yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I miss those jam and pancake days you would shower and I would bade
It feels like I just fade away, fade away, fade away, away
I wish that I'd just...
