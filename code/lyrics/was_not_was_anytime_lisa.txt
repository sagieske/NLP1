Song:

Anytime Lisa was what the guys named her
You could have her tonight
All you had to do was claim her
There was nothing to stop them from taking her out
Night after night they kissed her and tossed her about
You could prove you're a man
They said that anyone can
So everybody took a piece of Anytime Lisa
Anytime Lisa just couldn't refuse them
A girl wants love, and guys just abuse them
To be in their arms beats being alone
Still it wasn't like having someone of her own
You could prove you're a man
They said that anyone can
So everybody took a piece of Anytime Lisa
Phone rings, it's another voice
Brief flings, but what's her choice
She's by herself and there's no one else
Anytime Lisa, I'm not like the others
Please understand me
I don't want to be a one-night lover
There's something inside you that I want to touch
Girl you just gotta trust me, I want you so much
No need to prove I'm a man
I'm just your number one fan
I want more than just a piece of Anytime Lisa
