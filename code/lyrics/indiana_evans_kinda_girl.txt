Song:

I'm the kinda girl when I'm lookin at ya
Further than you mind can see
I'm the kinda girl gonna make it happen
Today, say

I don't need a hand when your hittn' zero
I can do it all myself
Heard about your plans, think I'm goin solo
Hey, yeahhh

So I'll make it easy
Yeah yeah
Hey boy I wanna have some fun
Hey boy I wanna drift into the
Hey now I wanna dance away the night
Hey boy you gotta look real keen
Wanna be hot you gotta treat them mean
Hey boy I wanna have some fun tonight

I don't really know if your heart is feeling
Know if I believe in you
Give me what I need or the ship is sinking today
Hey
I don't understand if your running slowly
Left me standing by myself
All I need to know is your really burning for me
Hey

So I'll make it easy
Yeah yeah
Hey boy I wanna have some fun
Hey boy I wanna drift into the
Hey now I wanna dance away the night
Hey boy you gotta look real keen
Wanna be hot you gotta treat them mean
Hey boy I wanna have some fun tonight

Seems like it's all because of you (all because of)
Don't think my heart will break in two (break in two)
I've learned to play the hard way
Don't push or it's the highway
You

Hey boy, hey boy
Hey now I wanna dance away the night (the night, the night, the night)
Hey boy I wanna have some fun
Hey boy I wanna drift into the
Hey now I wanna dance away the night (tonight)
Hey boy you gotta look real keen
Wanna be hot you gotta treat them mean
Hey boy I wanna have some fun tonight
