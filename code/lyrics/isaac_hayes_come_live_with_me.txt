Song:

Of all the things I want in the world
Is to have you to come live with me
And be my girl

You see, I've done a lot of playing around
Big cities and some smaller towns
A lot of girls, they knew my name
And were fascinated by my game

But finally there comes a time
When one leaves his past behind
Because he meets a girl like you
The likes of which he never knew

Love is here
And I know it's here to stay
So please, my dear, believe me when I say

Just as long as fire is hot
Girl, you have all the love I've got
Come live with me, girl

I've never been in love at all
Never thought I'd ever fall
But you touched my heart and soul
And you took complete control

Everyday you're on my mind
I think about you all the time
Just how beautiful it would be
If you were constantly with me

Making love with you
Is a joy I've never known
I know you feel it too
So let me take you home

'Cause just as long as fire is hot
Girl you have all the love I've got
Come live with me

And just as long as the world is round
I swear, I'll never let you down
Please live with me, girl

I'll try very hard to be
The man that you want me to be
I'll do anything to satisfy
I don't want to make you cry

True love and security
Are two things a women needs
And these things I promise to give
Just as long as I shall live

Love is here
And I know it's here to stay
So please, my dear, believe me when I say

Just as long as fire is hot
Girl you have all the love I've got
Come live with me, girl

And just as long as the world is round
I swear, I'll never let you down
Please live with me, girl

Just as long as fire is hot
Girl you have all the love I've got
Come live with me, girl

And just as long as the world is round
I swear, I'll never let you down
Come live with me, yeah, yeah

And just as long as fire is hot
You know, you've have all the love I've got
Come live with me, girl

And just as long as the world is round
I swear, I'll never let you down
Please live with me

And just as long as fire is hot
Girl, you have all the love I've got
Come live with me, yeah

And just as long as the world is round
I swear, I'll never let you down
You got to promise me that you'll
Come live with me

And just as long as fire is hot
You know that you have all the love I've got
Come live with me
