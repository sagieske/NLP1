Song:

(words and music by clyde otis and ivory joe hunter)
I could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart

Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you so?

I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My huggin and my kissin belong to just one

Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you so?

If you gave me nine lives like a tommy cat
Id give em all to you and never take one back

Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you so?

I'm putting on my sunday suit and I'm goin downtown
But I'll be kissin your lips before the sun goes down

Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you so?

Aint that loving you baby?
Aint that loving you so?
