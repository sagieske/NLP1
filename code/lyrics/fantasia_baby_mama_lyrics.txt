BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
This goes out to all my baby mamas
BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
I got love for all my baby mamas

It's about time we had our own song
Don't know what took so long
'Cuz now a days it's like a badge of honor
To be a baby mama

I see ya payin' ya bills
I see ya workin' ya job
I see ya goin' to school
And girl I know it's hard

And even though ya fed up
With makin' beds up
Girl, keep ya head up
All my

BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
This goes out to all my baby mamas
BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
I got love for all my baby mamas

I see you get that support check in the mail
Ya open it and you're like "What the Hell?"
You say, "This ain't even half of Daycare"
Sayin' to yourself "This here ain't fair"

And all my girls who don't get no help
Who gotta do everything by yourself
Remember,"What don't kill you can only make you stronger"
My baby mama

BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
This goes out to all my baby mamas
BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
I got love for all my baby mamas

'Cuz we the backbone of the hood
I always knew that, that we could
We can go anywhere, we can do anything
I know we can make it if we dream
And I think it should be a holiday
For single mothers tryin' to make a way
But until then, here is your song
Show love to my

BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
This goes out to all my baby mamas
BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
I got love for all my baby mamas

BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
This goes out to all my baby mamas
BABY MAMA
This goes out to all my baby mamas
I got love for all my baby mamas

Don't you love? Don't you love? Don't you love?
Don't you love? Don't you love? Don't you love?
I got love for all my baby mamas
Don't you love? Don't you love? Don't you love?
Don't you love? Don't you love? Don't you love?
I got love for all my baby mamas
My baby mama
