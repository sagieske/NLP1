Song:

We've got a good thing goin' on
We've got a good thing goin' on
B-B-Baby
Wanting you so bad is a problem I have
And I know that you need me
But it wont come that easy
I said I know, I know, oooh


C'mon baby, you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from chest
My heart's on fire
I'm falling from your lips
You know, you know
We've got a good, good thing going on
We've got a good thing goin' on

Whisper to me softly
Let your hands do the talking
Resisting temptation
Devoting dedication
Lets move
(Shake it up, b-b-back up, shake it up)
Wanting you soo bad
Is a problem I have
And I know that you need me
But it won't come that easy
I said I know, I know, oooh


C'mon baby you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from my chest
My heart's on fire
I'm fallin' from your lips
You know, you know
We've got a good
Good thing going on

C'mon baby, you make me sweat
I'm suffocating
You stole the air from my chest
My heart's on fire (fire)
I'm fallin' from your lips (fire)
You know, you know
We've got a good
Good thing going on
C'mon baby(ahhh)
C'mon baby(ahh)
My heart's on fire (fire)
I'm fallin' from your lips (fire)
You know you know
We've got a good
Good thing going on
