Song:

I'm ready for war
Come into town and I'll hide you on the rise
In the city of gold
Fighting the tower with my feelings aside
When it's 2 in the night
The fire's in my heart is gon' keep me alive
And I'm ready for war

The voice in my head
It's telling me that I should stay in my bed
Cause it's 2 in the night
Why can't I sleep when it's 2 in the night
Cause the fire in my soul, hey
The fire in the soul got me ready to fight
And I'm ready for war

Climbed the streets
And I found my way over
You know I've been so lost in translation
Like I'm fighting for truth in Babylon
Tryna find my peace in this zone of war

Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
I'll be ready when the day comes

I'm ready for war
I'm ready for action, now watch me kick in the door
But what if the day comes when we go from sun to monsoon
Who can I run to, run to, run to
Will you be loyal, will you be true when I need you
Say

Climbed the streets
And I found my way over
You know I've been so lost in translation
Like I'm fighting for truth in Babylon
Tryna find my peace in this zone of war

Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
I'll be ready when the day comes

Even when the sky comes falling down
I'll be ready when the sky comes falling down

Today
I will march for me
Today
You will march for you
We raise our arms and hope for better wins
We fight a million battles every day
I don't wanna see us falling
So we just gotta keep on running
Even when the day comes calling
I'm ready to march

Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
Even when the day comes
I'll be ready when the day comes
