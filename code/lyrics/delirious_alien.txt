Song:

I feel a stranger in this land.
Where every step the gods command.
I breathe.
And children wander fatherless,
Through fields that spent their happiness.
I grieve.
Take them away to a higher place.
Give me a day cause I'm losing (face)

And I've never felt so alien.
Yes I've never felt so alien.

I feel danger every day,
With every stone we throw away.
Careful it's falling,
And who will sing a different song?
I hope to God it won't be long.
Believe.
Show me a way to a higher place.
Why is there sunshine on my guilty face?

Yes You are brighter than the sun.
Only Your love can make us one.
Jesus You're brighter than the sun.
Only Your love.
