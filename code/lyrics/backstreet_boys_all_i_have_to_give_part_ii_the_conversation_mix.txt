Song:

All, everything I have is for you

My name is Kev and I like the
Type of girl who can love me for me
A type of girl who I can hold in my arms
And give her all that I have to give

And if you're that type of girl
Then you're getting all of my love
(My love, my love)
That's right, baby

Hi, my name is Brian but you can call me B-Rok
'Cause I'll be rockin' your house
Nah, I'm just playing but on a real tip
I like a serious girl
Somebody who's gonna be smart
A girl who even likes to even go to school

Yo Bri, stop lying

Now come on Nick, for real
I like a girl who's got a good head on her shoulder

Yeah, right

Come on

My love, my love
All my love is for you
My love, my love
I'm gonna give it to you
My love, my love
My love is all I have to give, baby

My name is Howie D and this is 'Howie', do it
I like the type of girl that one day she'll become my wife
We'll get married and she'll make me breakfast
She'll make me lunch and my dinner
I want bacon and egg, pancakes, orange juice
Mash potatoes, turkey

Yo, yo, Howie, Howie, chill out Howie, Howie
Yo my name's A. J., I like a type of girl
Who'll let me do everything for her

Let me make you breakfast, let me make you lunch
Let me make you dinner, baby
But after that, just let me make you happy
You see, Howie, that's how you gotta do it
Howie, Howie, yo, yo, D

Yo, why do you diss me like that for

My love, my love
All my love is for you
My love, my love
I'm gonna give it to you
My love, my love
My love is all I have to give, baby

My name is Nick and I like the type of girl that loves to go dancin'
The type of girl that likes to move her body
The type of girl that likes to shake what her mama gave her
The type of girl that lets me hold her hand and then kiss her
The type to let me take her to the movies and then kiss her
The type to let me hold her so tight and then kiss her
And kiss her and kiss her and kiss her, he, he

My love, my love
All my love is for you
My love, my love
I'm gonna give it to you
My love, my love
My love is all I have to give, baby

My name is B-Rok
And I'm gonna always love you

My name is A. J
And I'm gonna always love you

My name is Howie
Howie doin', sweetheart

My name is Nick
And I will always love you

And baby, my name is Kev
And I just want you to know that I will always love you
Yes baby, no diggity

All I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
Give the world to you
But love is all I have to give
