Song:

Well I know that you know
That you've become the target of this hand
With never even asking
Well I know that you know
That you're the only thing that I can stand

So how could your hair
Have the nerve to dance around like that, blowing
And how could the air
Have the nerve to blow your hair around like that

I'm waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm looking for a trap door trigger
To drop me out of your view

Yes I'm listening I'm listening
I can tell that you are serious
Your looking for that hurt look around my mouth
The look of a steep fall
Yeah that's how Hersey put it

So you can make another claim
Well go ahead and make it
So you can make another claim
Well go ahead and make it

I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trap door trigger

I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trap door trigger

Yes I'm listening
I can tell you're serious
