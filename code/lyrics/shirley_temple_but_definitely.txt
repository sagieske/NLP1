Lyrics/Music Mack Gordon and Harry Revel
Bong! This is station L-O-V-E
Bong! I'm cupid's assistant
Please listen to me
My boss Mister Cupid told me
To make hearts loop the loop
Never ever to sing about
The Good Ship Lollipop
Or Animal Crackers In My Soup
So if the one you idolize is near you
A song of love will help you find the way
Cupid says a welling heart will hear you
If you move a little closer. Thank you
Press his little hand. That's fine
Now look into his eyes and say
------
You are an angel without any wings
A vision so lovely to see
Are you the reason my happy heart sings?
But definitely
Will I forever be faithful to you
You're mine and you always must be
Do I adore you? You know that I do
But definitely So definitely
You are the moon, the stars, the sun
You're every beat of my heart.... So supreme
But if it all turns out to be
Only a beautiful dream
Let's keep on dreaming
Millions or billions can't equal your worth
Your love is a blessing to me
Are you an armful of heaven here on earth?
You are? But definitely
------
When you are crooning the blue of the day
And whistling the gold of the dawn. Bing, bing!
Are you my fav'rite? You know that you are
But definitely Voo-voo-voo-voo-voom!
Will I forever.... *Whistle*
You always must be. Bee-bee-bee-beep!
Do I adore you? You know that I do
But definitely So definitely
You are the moon, the stars, the sun,
You're every beat of my heart, so supreme
But if it all turns out to be
Only a beautiful dream
Let's keep on dreaming
Millions or billions can't equal your worth
Your love is a blessing to me
Are you an armful of heaven here on earth?
You are? *Whistle* But definitely
The name of this song ain't Dinah
The name of this song ain't Dinah
The name of this song ain't Dinah
It's but definitely. Hah
