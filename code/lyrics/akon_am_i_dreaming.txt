Mmm, yeah

Red one convict
Yeah

Am I dreaming?

I'm not like all those other guys
Have you believing
It's to good to be true
And they come smothered in lies
Oh so decieving
Leaving you black and blue
See I'm show you
And get to know you
So girl,
Let me do what I do
And get it fooi?
A hundred fooi?
And make sure you
Feeling brand new

I know you never had a brother
Like me that was on another level
Squeezing you like you like it
Never hold back and never settle
Have your body trembling
Got you burning up like a kettle
Before you know it
We'll be sleeping
And dreaming this forever
Can you feel it
I kiss you so
You know it's real
I can see it
That beautiful body
And that s** appeal
(am I dreaming)
I know you wonder
If this real
Never go back to the
Thing that use
To give you something
You can feel

And when we kissed under the moon
Am I dreaming...
He showed me things I never knew
Am I dreaming...
He know exactly what to do
[x2] am I dreaming...
Am I...
[x2] am I... Dreeeeaming
(akon
Oeh, girl you're not dreaming)
(akon;
I can show you baby
That you're not dreaming)

Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

Got my heart up in this dance
What a beautiful man
That batchata as we rock on the set
Put his hand over my hips
Started looking at his lips
I'm the luckiest girl in the land
And I can't believe the way you
Got me feeling right

I don't wanna leave this place
Stay right by my side
But in my head I never thought
I could fall in love with you...

And when we kissed under the moon
Am I dreaming...
He showed me things I never knew
Am I dreaming...
He know exactly what to do
[x2] am I dreaming...
Am I...
[x2] am I... Dreeeeaming
(akon;
Oeh, girl you're not dreaming)
(akon;
I can show you baby
That you're not dreaming)

Baby wish
We never left the floor, I don't know
Don't wanna be alone anymore
We have something mesured out, I don't know
Are you real, am I dreaming...

The way you shake it to the right
And shake it to the left
Now and I would into the keep you
Dreaming like this [2x]

[x2]
Oh eh, oh eh, oh eh oh
Oh eh oh eh, oh ah
