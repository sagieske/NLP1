Song:

On this night
On any hot, summer night
Every girl
Every red-blooded boy
Is cryin out
With one great voice
They wanna jump
They wanna turn up the noise

And that's the sound
That's the thunderin sound
Of clappin hands
And of stompin their feet
Coast to coast
Like a national heart
Watch them go
Go wild in the street

Every kid in the you. S. A.
Is comin out to play
Its american as apple pie
Livin hard, riding high
Feelin every minute like the 4th of july
Go for broke
Do or die
American as apple pie

I gotta girl
I got one fine girl
Shes got hair
Like kansas wheat
She can move
Like a new york street
And she can kiss
She can kiss so sweet

On this night
On this glorious night
We got plans
We got red, hot schemes
Of bustin out
Before we break at the seams
Well cut a piece
Of the american dream

Every kid in the you. S. A.
Is comin out to play
Its american as apple pie
Livin hard, riding high
Feelin every minute like the 4th of july
Go for broke
Do or die
American as apple pie

Its american as apple pie
Livin hard, riding high
Feelin every minute like the 4th of july
Go for broke
Do or die
American
Its american
Its american as apple pie

American as apple pie
Livin hard, riding high
Livin every minute like the 4th of july
