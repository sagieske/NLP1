Song:

I used to want to be
Living like it's only me
And now I spend my time
Thinking â€˜bout to get you off my mind
I used to be so tough
Never really gave enough
And then you caught my eye
Giving me the feeling of a lightning strike

Look at me now
I'm falling
Can't even talk, the stuttering
This cloud amor keeps shaking
Oh oh oh
Now!

All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everbody's tryin' to be a millionaire
But everytime I look at you I just don't care
Cause All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

I used to run around
I didn't want to settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this

Look at me now
I'm falling
I can't even touch the sun ray
This cloud amor keeps shaking
Oh oh oh

All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

I used to run around
I didn't want to settle down
But now I wake each day
Looking for a way that I can see your face
I've got your photograph
But baby I need more than that
I need to know your lips
Nothing ever mattered to me more than this

Look at me now
I'm falling
Can't even talk, the stuttering
All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah

All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you
All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Everbody's tryin' to be a millionaire
But everytime I look at you I just don't care
Cause All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Cause All I want to be
All I ever want to be, yeah, yeah
Is somebody to you

Yeah you
