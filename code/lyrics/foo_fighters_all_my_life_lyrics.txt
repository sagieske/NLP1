Song:

All my life I've been searching for somethin
Somethin never comes, never leads to nothin
Nothin satisfies, but I'm gettin close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, and it's takin away
Leaves me with the feelin that I fear the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Calm down, don't you resist
Your such a delicate rist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin to hold when I lose my grip

Will I find something in there,
To give it just what it needs
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

One by one, hidden up my sleeve

[3x]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but, I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

Will I find the believer
Another one who believes
Another one to decieve
Over and over, down on my knees

If I get any closer, I
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothin to hide

On and on I've got nothin to hide

[3x]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but, I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

All my life I've been searching for somethin
Somethin never comes, never leads to nothin
Nothin satisfies, but I'm gettin close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, and it's takin away
Leaves me with the feelin that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

And I'm Done, done; on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, and I'm on to the next one

Done, done, and I'm on to the next one
[2x]
Done, done, and I'm on the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm on to the next

[3x]
Done, done; on the next one

Done, I'm done; I'm on to the next one

[3x]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it but, I hate that taste
Weight keeping me down

[2x]
Done, done; on the next one

Done, I'm done; I'm on to the next
