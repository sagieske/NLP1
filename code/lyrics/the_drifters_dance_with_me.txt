Song:

Dance with me....
Dance with me....
Dance with me....
Dance with me....

Dance with me
Oh... Hold me closer, closer and closer
Much closer
While the music plays
Mmm... Darling dance with me
Oh.. Hold me tighter tighter and tighter
Much tighter while the rhythm sways

Mmm put your lips to mine
While the music plays
We're no longer strangers
Now we're more them friends

Dance with me, Dance with me
Closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers
When the music ends

Dance with me, Dance with me
Closer, closer and closer
And maybe we'll be lovers
When the music ends
Darling won't you please x3
