Song:

The moment you wake up
Startled and shaked up
With nothing but the radio on
You don't even listen
Just turn the ignition
And turn you back on everyone

Sulphur lights are passing by
All alone in the dead of night
Did you ever wonder why?

Better learn to love before you die
Learn to walk before you fly
Better learn to live while your alive
Learn to laugh and learn to cry
Before you die... Before you die...

Matchbooks and postcards
Lined up like graveyards
Remind you of the places you've been
You need a distraction
A reckless reaction
To save you from the state you're in

Border lights are passing by
All alone in the dead of night
Did you ever wonder why

Better learn to love before you die
Learn to walk before you fly
Better learn to live while your alive
Learn to laugh and learn to cry
Before you die... Before you die...

Every sunset is a hurricane
Every breath is a passing day
It's not too late...
