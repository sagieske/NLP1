Song:

Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends but not like before

To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't the ending

Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart

We loved, we laughed, we cried
Suddenly love died
The story ended
But we're just friends

Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart

We loved, we laughed, we cried
Suddenly love died
The story ended
But we're just friends
