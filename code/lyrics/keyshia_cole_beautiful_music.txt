Song:

Yea yea yea yea yea oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ay ay ay ay ay o o o o o
Every time I see your face
Ever since that day met
Sparks flying every where
Gotta get my chance with you boy
You seem to be the one for me let's make it happen baby

No one else can do what you can do
No one else can fill the void you fill only you (baby yea yea)
And I seem to not have control
And I don't think I want to

Chorus
Baby she don't have to know
What we been up to
And he don't have what we been up to
Beautiful music
Let's make beautiful music

(I want you to) Check my summer love everything feels so right
Everything seems like we could work it out
Another time that the 2 of us that shared so let's make it happen baby
No one else can do what you can do
No can else fill the void you fill only you (baby yea yea)
And I seem to not have control
And I don't think I want to

Chorus
Baby she don't have to know
What we been up to
And he don't have to know
What we been up to
Beautiful music
Let's make beautiful music

So let's dance the night away
The beat of your music so right every time I feel the rhythm in my soul
There ain't no way you won't feel my magic boy
Let's dance all night yeah

Gimme your love 2 x
I know why I stay around cause I'm deeply in love
With the way you make me feel do not stop
Pretty girl holding my hips kissing my lips don't stop
I love ya smile kid me often

With ya Style and swag can't pay to get off ya
And I your digging me I'm priceless
Got my Own Cars cribs and my rocks are flawless

Chorus 2 x
Baby she don't have to know
What we been up to
And he don't have to know
What we been up to
Beautiful music
Let's make beautiful music
Ay ay ay o o o
Ay ay ay o o o

Ay ay o o
Gimme your love (till fade)
