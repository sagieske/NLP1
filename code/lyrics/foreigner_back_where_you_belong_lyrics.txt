Song:

I felt so sure of the love that we shared
There was no reason on earth to be scared
Then I heard a rumor, it started to grow
Slowly but surely, the truth began to show

Then I started wonderin', as I picked up the phone
And a man started askin', if you were at home

You treat me like a fool, but you're so wrong
I'm gonna send you back where you belong
I put my trust in you, but I was wrong
I'm gonna send you back where you belong

You treat me like a fool, but you're so wrong
I'm gonna send you back where you belong

I never had any doubt in my mind
Now you have shown me, love can make you blind

Back where you belong, back where you belong
Back where you belong, back where you belong
Back where you belong, back where you belong
Back where you belong, back where you belong
Back where you belong, back where you belong
Back where you belong...
