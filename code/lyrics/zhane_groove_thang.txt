Song:

Well, it's a groove thang
It's got a funky swing
Well, it's a groove thang
A groove thang

[Chorus:]
We're moving on
Keeping strong
Don't you let them steer you wrong
It's a groove thang
We're gonna give you what you want
Just as long as you're around
It's a groove thang

[Repeat chorus]

Oh, yeah, uh

People, there's really nothing to it
Let your mind at rest
My friend, and do it

Remember it ain't over
Till it's really over
Groove thang, groove thang

Relax your mind
Listen to the rhythm
It's got you going
But it's in precision

Music and life
And we are living
Groove thang, groove thang
Groove thang

[Repeat chorus]

Oh, yeah
It's gonna make you touch the sky
Your body's moving left to right
You're grooving to the morning light
It's a groove thang, oh, yeah

It takes some time to realize
Your body's moving left right
The feeling's, oh, so dynamite
It's a groove thang

So whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Keep your body moving

So whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do
Keep your body moving
On and on

Party people
It's a silky fun and groovy thang
Party people
It's a silky fun and groovy thang
Oh, yeah

[Repeat chorus 2x]
Hit me with your best song, Todd
