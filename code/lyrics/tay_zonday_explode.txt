Song:

The lights are on
The stage is set
You're asking God
If you were made for this

People stare
With lonely eyes
"Deliver us so we can
Forget our lives. "

You don't know how
To work the crowd
It looked so easy
On the tv show

When you fail
The sound ignites
You know the music's gonna
Save your life

[Chorus:]
Hey kid, you're gonna get old
You're not gonna be a centerfold
Better blow up, better get rich
Better be makin' that beat explode

Hey kid, the college degree
It ain't gonna beat back poverty
Tough kid, it's a rough world
Better be makin' that beat explode
[2xChorus]

People cheer and
People jeer and
Sometimmes they may
Act in fear but

Everybody now
Shakes their body yeah
Gets a naughty groove
Between the still-life.

Can't make rockets
But you can make souls
Take off when
That beat explodes yeah

Takin' off 'n yeah
Takin' off 'n now
Takin' off 'n 'til
That beat explodes yeah

[Chorus:]
