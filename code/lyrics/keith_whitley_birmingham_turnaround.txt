Song:

The Birmingham Turnaround (Keith Whitley)


Caught a plane to Birmingham
Leaving you was my plan
Then head on south by any means
Thought I might blend in 'round New Orleans

But when the plane got off the ground
I saw your face in a cloud
Saw your tears out on the wing
Don't guess my heart was free to leave

Birmingham would have to wait for a little later date
And I said I'd see you later New Orleans
'Cause I knew my rambling ways had seen their better days
And suddenly I had a change in dreams

Caught a plane from Birmingham
Back in your arms is where I am
At times we laugh and talk about
The day I did the Birmingham turnaround

Birmingham would have to wait for a little later date
And I said I'd see you later New Orleans
'Cause I knew my rambling ways had seen their better days
And suddenly I had a change in dreams

Caught a plane from Birmingham
Back in your arms is where I am
At times we laugh and talk about
The day I did the Birmingham turnaround

And now we laugh and talk about
The day I did the Birmingham turnaround
