Song:

Starting at the river
Watching the water flow
I can't stop the river
Never, no
If I could make the mountains
Fall into the sea
Maybe I could make you
Fall for me
(Would you) change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
All the stars keep turning
Wheeling all night long
I wish you'd turn
And hear my song
If I could make wild horses
Come and get their hay
Maybe I could make you
Sway my way
(Would you) change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
Maybe when you're sleeping
I can make a spell
And when you wake up
I won't tell
(Would you) change your mind
Change your mind, change your mind
