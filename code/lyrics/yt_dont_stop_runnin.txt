Song:

You know I thought you were so naive
But you were runnin' a game on me
'Cause baby I saw through your lies, lies, lies
When I had the world in the palm of my hand
You never looked at another man
But when I started to slip you said, "Bye, bye, bye"

Time has made you just a memory
Now I'm winnin' so baby if I see
You runnin' back to me, you better

Keep on runnin', don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin' 'cause you can't catch me
You better keep on runnin', don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin', oh yeah

Ah, well you heard I got my big break
So now you're sayin' that you made a mistake
And you wanna come back for the ride, ride, ride
Well the word is out all over town
You're not the only girl who's chasin' me now
Take your place at the end of the line, line, line

Used to love you but you set me free
Table's turnin' now you're beggin' me
Baby can't you see you gotta

Keep on runnin', don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin' well you can't catch me
You better keep on runnin', don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin', oh yeah

If you wanna get next to me
(Don't stop runnin')
If you wanna feel the ecstasy
(Don't stop runnin')
If you want it like it used to be
(Keep on runnin')
So you want another chance with me
(Don't stop runnin')

Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah you better

Keep on runnin'
Don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin'

If you wanna get next to me
(Keep on runnin')
If you wanna feel the ecstasy
(Don't stop runnin')
If you want it like it used to be
(Keep on runnin')
Keep on runnin'

So you want another chance with me
(Keep on runnin')
Oh baby you're just a memory
(Don't stop runnin')
'Cause you'll never catch up with me
(Keep on runnin')
Keep on runnin', oh yeah

Keep on runnin'
Don't stop runnin'
Keep on runnin'
