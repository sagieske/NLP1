Song:

Dust from your skin
Must trust, when it scatters
Only love matters
It's been overjoyed

Scents and perfumes
Whence, since your higher fragrance
Is memory
Incense and never destroy

Every stop we've taken
Is now a wonderous shrine
Where nature is in order
Your sense is sensing mine
As I love you
All the creatures play
As I love you
Now it's safe to say
There's no hang up in our way

The trees in our gaze
Will show us the love that we breath in
This shouldn't amaze
They openly love all they are
And love's all they are

Gifts, to begin
Bliss, cliffs of expression
They suit our impression
And every whim.

Taste has got thirst
Faced, waste
Beyond uses, 
With so many juices
Were filled to the brim

Our pleasure's not forsaken
We cultivate our bend
More chances re-awaken when beginning meets the end
As I love you, 
Now it's safe to say
There's no hang up in our way
As I love you

The faith that we build
Will strengthen our close growing closer
Till waiting is filled
We simply remember we are, 
Where ever we are.

Clay that we print
May stay as we mold it
But will never hold it
The promise is long

Till we're complete
Will, still is intention
We still need attention to help us along.
