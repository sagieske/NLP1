Song:

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who would dance on the floor, in the round
She said I am the one, who would dance on the floor, in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean and she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who would dance on the floor, in the round, babe

People always told me be careful what you do,
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mama always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, cause the lie becomes the truth yeah, yeah

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, no
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son, no, oohhhh

For forty days and forty nights,
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, babe

So take my strong advice,
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice, do think twice

She told m baby that we'd danced till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby, woah

People always told me be careful what you do

Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mama always told me be careful what you do
Be careful what you do, because the lie becomes the truth, yeah, yeah

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, no, no
She said I am the one, but the kid is not my son, no

Let's go
Ohhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooohhh
Woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oohhh

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son, no, no
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son, no, no

Billie Jean is not my lover
(No she ain't)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(No she ain't)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(She's not the one)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(No she ain't)
Billie Jean is not my lover
(No, no, no, no)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
(Yeah)
Billie Jean is not my lover
