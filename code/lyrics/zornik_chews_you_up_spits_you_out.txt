Song:

What's a friend supposed to do
When you're down
And you know
There's no love anymore
Yes I know
That the truth will not come true?
Unless the stars will not shine anymore
Yes I know

What's a friend supposed to do
When you're down
And you know
There's no love anymore
Yes I know
That the truth will not come true
Unless the stars will not shine anymore
Yes I know

It chews you up, it spits you out
And it's worse than razerblades in your mouth
It turns you inside out
It chews you up, it spits you out
And it's worse than razerblades in your mouth
It turns your world upside down

For my tears and for my glory
For the persons who ignore it
I must warn you to be sure
Your love is real
For my tears and for my glory
For the persons who ignore it
I must warn you to be sure
Your love is real
Yes I know
Yes I know
Yes I know
Yes I know
