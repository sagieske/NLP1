Song:

Life's like a road that you travel on
There's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

{Chorus:}
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights

Knock me down, and back up again
You're in my blood
I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
Road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors

{Chorus:}
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah! )

{Chorus:}
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (Mmmm, Yeah! )

If you're going my way (your going my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long)

There was a distance between you and I(between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye
Ooooohh
Mmmm yea!

There ain't no load that I can't hold
A road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

{Chorus:}
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long (All night long! Yeah Yeah! )
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long

(Gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, yeah! )

{Chorus:}
Life is a highway (Life is a highway! )
I wanna ride it all night long (Woo Woo Wooo! Yeah! )
If You're going my way (your going my way)
I wanna drive it all night long (all night long yeah! )

Ah gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah! )
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
Yea I'm gonna ride it all night long baby
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long
