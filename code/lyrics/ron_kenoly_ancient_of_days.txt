Song:

Blessing and Honour
Glory and Power
Be unto the ancient of days
From every nation
All of creation
Bow before the ancient of days

Bridge:
Every tongue in heaven and earth
Shall declare your glory
Every knee shall bow at your throne
In worship
You will be exalted oh God
And your kingdom shall not pass away
Oh ancient of days

Chorus:
Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth
Sing to the ancient of days
For none can compare to your matchless worth
Sing to the ancient of days
(Bridge and Chorus again)
