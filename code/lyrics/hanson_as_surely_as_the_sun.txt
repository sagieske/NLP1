Song:

As surely as the sun rises each day
So my love will never change
And though the years may come and go
My love will only grow and grow

Sometimes I wonder what you see in me
'Cause Iґm only a man flowed in so many ways you see

I want to share every moment of the day with you
And I want to share every sunset and every sunrise
And every monlit night

'Cause as surely as the sun rises each day
So my love will neve change
And though the years may come and go
My love will only grow and grow

Sometimes I wonder what you see in me
ґCause Iґm only a man flowed in so many ways you see

'Cause as surley as the sun rises each daySo my love will never change
And though the years may come and go
My love will only grow and grow

Every day when the sun comes out

As surely as the sun
