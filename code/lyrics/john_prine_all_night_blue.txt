Song:

You've got a life somewhere without me
I've gone on without you
It hasn't been easy getting used to
Being lonely and tonight is an all night blue
And I wonder how you look and who looks at you
In your nightgown
I can almost feel your body
Your warm and loving body when I lay down

Chorus:
It's an all night blue
Remembering you
It's an all night blue
Wondering who's loving you... All night

Well it hurts me to see that you're
Happy without me cause I still need you
I just drank up my heart
Set it empty on the table 'cause I
Ain't got nothing better to do
Still I wonder how you look and
Who looks at you every morning
I can still feel your warm breath
You kissing me on the chest
I'm just dreaming

Chorus
