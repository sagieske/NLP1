Song:

A million to one, that's what our folks
Think about this love of ours
A million to one, they say thar our love
Will fade like yesterday's clouds
They're betting everything
That our love, won't survive
They're hoping in time
We'll forget each other's lives
A million to one, they say that we're
Too young to know the meaning of love
A million to one, that they've forgotten
The dreams that we're dreaming of
But we'll forgive them, because we love them
After all that's said and done
There's one in a million: a million to one
A million to one, they say that we're
Too young to know the meaning of love
A million to one, that they've forgotten
The dreams that we're dreaming of
But we'll forgive them, because we love them
After all that's said and done
There's one in a million: a million to one
A million to one, a million to one
