(Jai Ho)
(Jai Ho)I got (I got) shivers (shivers), 
When you touch away, 
I'll make you hot, 
Get all you got, 
I'll make you wanna say (Jai Ho)

(Jai Ho)

I got (I got) fever (fever), 
Running like a fire, 
For you I will go all the way, 
I wanna take you higher (Jai Ho)
I keep it steady
Cuz steady is how I feel it.
This beat is heavy, so heavy, 
You gon feel it.

(Jai Ho)You are the reason that I breathe, (Jai Ho)
You are the reason that I still believe, (Jai Ho)
You are my destiny, 
Jai Ho! Uh-uh-uh-oh! 
(Jai Ho)No there is nothing that can stop us(Jai Ho)
Nothing can ever come between us, (Jai Ho)
So come and dance with me, 
Jai Ho! (oohh)

Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me, 
I want you now, 
I know you can save me, come and save me, 
I need you now.
I am yours forever, yes, forever, 
I will follow, 
Anywhere in anyway, 
Never gonna let go.

Jai Ho

(Jai Ho) Escape (escape) away (away), 
I'll take you to a place, 
This fantasy of you and me, 
I'll never lose the chase. (Jai Ho)

Yeaahhhh (Jai Ho) Yeaahhhh

I can (I can) feel you (feel you), 
Rushing through my veins, 
There's an notion in my heart, 
I will never be the same.

(Jai Ho)Just keep it burnin', yeah baby, 
Just keep it comin', (Jai Ho)
You're gonna find out, baby, 
I'm one in a million.

(Jai Ho)You are the reason that I breathe, (Jai Ho)
You are the reason that I still believe, (Jai Ho)
You are my destiny, 
Jai Oh! Uh-uh-uh-oh! 

(Jai Ho)No there is nothing that can stop us(Jai Ho)
Nothing can ever come between us(Jai Ho)
So come and dance with me, 
Jai Ho! (oohh) (You and me, it's destiny)

Catch me, catch me, catch me, come and catch me, 
I want you now, 
I know you can save me, come and save me, 
I need you now.
I am yours forever, yes, forever, 
I will follow, 
Anywhere in anyway, 
Never gonna let go.

Jai Ho (Yeeeaaahh), Jai Ho (Yeeeaaahh), Jai Ho

I need you, 
Gonna make it, (Jai Ho)
I'm ready, 
So take it! 

(Jai Ho)You are the reason that I breathe, (Jai Ho)
You are the reason that I still believe, (Jai Ho)
You are my destiny, 
Jai Oh! Uh-uh-uh-oh!
