Song:

She had a gap between her two front teeth that you could drive a truck through
Breath like a trash can dumpster, that would kill you
She drove a 1973, chevy blazer
And her legs & her armpits never seen a razor....
She had curlers in her hair, window rolled down
Dip of snuff, spit on the ground
Drunk as I was that woman looked good to me........

Now I got this burnin sensation when I pee
When I'm standin in a public bathroom
People stop & take a look at me

I got this burnin sensation when I pee

I got this burnin sensation when I pee.. Oh hay hay
I got a damn good feelin your the one who gave it to me
I got creepy crawly crabs crawlin all over me
Them itchy little b******s ya' just can't get 'em to leave
