Song:

What will I do with all those yesterdays where will I go what will I say
How can I live since you have gone away what will I do with all those yesterdays
Tomorrow never bothers me I know what it will bring
It is just another day and it won't mean a thing
But when nighttime falls and mem'ries come to play
What will I do with all those yesterdays
[ guitar ]
Tomorrow never bothers me...
