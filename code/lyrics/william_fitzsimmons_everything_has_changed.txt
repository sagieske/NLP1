Song:

Today I saw my father standing in the graveyard
Looking very somber looking for his mom
When he finally found her he said that it was different
Everything is different nothing's really changed

My brother would remember sitting in the hallway
Waiting for my father both of us were scared
When the doorknob turned we took off for the stairway
Looking for some cover trying to get away

A guide dog had to serve the role that you would not let
The mother of your children every really play
The office was a dungeon where you hid your fears of
What would really happen if no one ever came

I wonder if you blamed yourself for when she left you
By closing up the garage door and turning on the car
Your father must have lost it your sister couldn't help you
But dad if you were lonely you had no where to turn

Of father can't you see the pieces that have fallen on the ground
When you and mom decided nothing could be saved inside this house

Everything has changed
Everything has changed

Last night I had a dream that I was in the graveyard
Looking at my father buried in the ground
I'd swear that I could hear him tell me he was sorry
He told me he was sorry and everything has changed
