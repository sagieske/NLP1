Heart, soul

I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, Ain't got no clothes
Ain't got no perfume, Ain't got no skirts
Ain't got no sweaters, Ain't got no smokes
Ain't got no god.

Ain't got no father, Ain't got no mother
Ain't got no sisters, I've got one brother
Ain't got no land, Ain't got no country
Ain't got no freedom, Ain't got no god,
Ain't got no mind,

Ain't got no earth, Ain't got no students
Ain't got no father, Ain't got no mother
Ain't got no sweets, Ain't got no ticket
Ain't got no token, Ain't got no mind
Ain't got no land.

But there is something I've got,
There is something I've got,
There is something I've got,
Nobody can take it away...

Got my hair on my head
Got my brains, Got my ears
Got my eyes, Got my nose
Got my mouth, I got my smile
I got my tongue, Got my chin
Got my neck, Got my boobies
Got my heart, Got my soul
Got my back, I got my s**

I got my arms, my hands, my fingers,
My legs, my feet, my toes,
And my liver, got my blood..

I got life, I've got life's, I've got headaches,
And toothaches and bad times too like you...

Got my hair on my head
Got my brains, Got my ears
Got my eyes, Got my nose
Got my mouth, I got my smile
I got my tongue, Got my chin
Got my neck, Got my boobies
Got my heart, Got my soul
Got my back, I got my s**

I got my arms, my hands, my fingers,
My legs, my feet, my toes,
And my liver, got my blood..

I got life, and I'm going to keep it
As long as I want it, I got life.....

Heart, soul
Heart, soul
