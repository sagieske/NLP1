M: He's definitly fine
K: That's right

He walks in the club with love in his eyes
S*** steps flock flockin females by his side
Lookin scrumptious, even though he ain't tryin'
Finest thing that you ever did see
S*** creation had his hat tilted to the side
Starin at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualize, had my body paralyzed
As he smiled at me, I said
Hey boy would you enjoy sittin' next to me in your corduroys?
I'm from Texas my girl is from Illinois
Where you from, can I come visit you sometimes?
My oh my you seem like husband material
Got any children yo?
Are you married cause your very very extraordinary, kinda scary
I want your name added to my vocabulary

*Chorus* 2x
Lullaby love
Where have you been all of my life?
Your chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

Tell me your dreams and aspirations
What's your furture plans
What's your motivations
Boy I'm lovin how your so unpredictible, boy I'm feelin you
Guess I gotta get with you
Admiring your Marc Jacob gear
Hit as I step say a prayer
You available, so sensual
Lullaby love heartbreakable, so special, baby makeable

*Chorus*

It's all in the way you look at me
Apple Pie A La Mode
I'm sure I'll be enjoying your company
Apple Pie A La Mode
You turning me on with your modesty
Apple Pie A La Mode
You have such a beautiful personality
Apple Pie A La Mode
Heeeee

*Chorus*

Beyonce
So scrumptious love
Apple a la pie mode
