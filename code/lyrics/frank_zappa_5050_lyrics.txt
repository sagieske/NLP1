Song:

Well, my dandruff is loose
An' my breath is chartreuse
I know I ain't cute
An' my voice is ka-poot

But that's awright people
I'm just crazy enough to sing to you
Any old way

I figure the odds be fifty-fifty
I just might have some thing to say

Ain't gonna sing you no love song
How my heart is all sore
Will not beg your indulgence
'Cause you heard it before

An' that's awright people
I'm just crazy enough to sing to you
Any old way

I figure the odds be fifty-fifty
I just might have some thing to say
Ants in my pants!

I have taken your time
I have sung you my song
Ain't no great revelation
But it wasn't too long

An' that's awright people
I'm just crazy enough to sing to you
Any old way, ha ha!

I figure the odds be fifty-fifty
I just might have some thing to say
