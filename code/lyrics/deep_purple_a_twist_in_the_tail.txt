-------------------------
As you watch from your house on the hill
World keeps spinning around you you're standing still
And a thought rivers enters your mind
Something happened once in my life
A fading picture of you that's so hard to describe
I've been where the sun never shines
That's alright there's a change in the story
That's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale
Face in the mirror head in the clouds
Hanging on to a dream that you can't do without
As it drops like a stone without trace
Give what you want take what you need
Squeezing so hard there's no room to breathe
And your flavour has fallen from grace
That's alright there's a change in the story
That's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale
I saw you dancing
Dancing on air
You were lost in the in the starlight
No one but me really cared
Every question turns out a lie
Can't you swallow the truth for once in your life
I loved you but don't ask me why
It's alright there's a change in the story
It's alright there's a change in the plan
A twist in the tale
