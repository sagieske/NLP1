Song:

God be with you
God be with you
I say, God be with you
Until we meet again

God be with you
God be with you
Keep on singin' god be with you
Until we meet again

And if we never
Oh, shall meet you
If we never
Oh, shall greet you

I'm singin' God be with you
Until we meet again

Just keep on workin'
For the Master
Yes, He'll be with you
Here and after

Singin' God be with you
Until we meet again

God be with you
God be with you
Keep on singin' God be with you
Until we meet again

I said, God be with you
God be with you
God be with you
Until we meet again

God be with you
Until we meet again
Again
