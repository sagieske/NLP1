Song:

[Chorus:]
Baby whatcha gotta say?
Imma do you right, Imma love you every single day
They don't know you anyway, so right, no one else can make me feel the same
You're a natural born killer. Wanted dead or alive, baby Imma ride with ya, ayy
Nobody else gets ya, I'm saying, you kill 'em all. You kill 'em all

[Verse]
Baby, I'm in love with your bad habits. Ay, ay
If you're a drug, I gotta have it. Ayy
You're not perfect, but every little move you make, it's all worth it
It's like you're speaking my language. Baby
Just the way you are, I can tell you hate being alone. Oh
Hoping you won't break my heart, but I have a feeling you won't. Oh

[Pre-Chorus:]
I ain't gonna fake it. Feelin' like you should know
I just want ya, I just want ya baby. Oh

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
See it on your face, I know you want it. Ay, ay
Only one place, let 'em know you got this. Ayy
Nothing like a first time, baby if you let me imma treat you right
You know you're my favorite, baby
Just the way you talk, I can tell you'll never treat me wrong. Oh
Gentleman at heart, but, would you take me home? Oh

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Baby, imma leave a light on
And tonight I'm gonna stay strong
Baby imma leave a light on
And you know where I'm at
Know you love it, you'll be coming right back

[Chorus:]
