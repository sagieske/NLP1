Song:

I searched all over
Could not find
Someone to hold
Some peace of mind
Yesterday is gone
Nothing else to do
But let it go
Before I lose
All of my hopes
And my dreams
For something that aint real
Things aint always as they seem

Pre chorus
Cause there's sunshine
After rain
And after the night comes morning
And in the spring the flowers bloom again
When I'm feeling down

Like there's no way out
I know the love I have inside will make it alright

Chorus
And when it feels like I'm going crazy
When it feels like I'm going insane
When it feels like I'm going crazy
Found a cure
To get me through another day

Found a cure
To get me through another day

How many times before have you
Been left alone and you feel confused
Do you have the strength to keep trying
When the walls just keep on closing in
But you got everything that you need
Inside your heart
If you just believe
Things aint always as they seem

Pre chorus
Chorus
