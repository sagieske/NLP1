Song:

I can remember the time
When you said that you were mine
Youve made my life
Shine so bright
The feeling was oh, so right
And you put your arms around me
As we sway side to side
Bright stars up above me
Like flashing disco lights
As we dance
Somewhere in south of France
We will fly
Entangle up that bright lit sky
As we dance, as we dance
One night we were all alone
Somewhere far out on our own
Then you listen
While the music plays
Over and over since yesterday
And you wrap yourself around me
As we sway side to side
Bright stars up above me
Like flashing disco lights
As we dance
Somewhere in south of France
We will fly
Entangle up that bright lit sky
When we dance
In the streets of Paris, France
We will fly
Entangle up that bright lit sky
Like love birds flyin
Side by side
As we dance, as we dance
