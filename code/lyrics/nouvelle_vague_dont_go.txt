Song:

Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard the sound
Of footsteps on the floor

Love just like addiction
Now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love gonna see me through

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go, don't go, yeah
Don't go

Baby, you make your mind up
Give me what you got
Fix me with your lovin'
Shut the door and turn the lock

Hey, go get the doctor
Doctor came too late
Another night I feel alright
My love for you can't wait

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go, don't go, don't go please
Don't go away, yeah

Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard the sound
Of footsteps on the floor

Said, she was a killer
Now I know it's true
I'm dead when you walk out the door
Hey babe, I'm hooked on you, oh yeah

Can't stop now, don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go, don't go, don't go

Oh, don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go oh, please
