Song:

Some people cry the blues, I never could
Had no time for tears, life was to good
I had the brightest smile in town, oh yeah
But you took it baby and turned it upside down

Everything went my way, life was a ball
But then you came along, changed it all
You took the brightest smile in town, oh yeah
Took it baby and turned it upside down

You brought me love, oh tender love
That made my whole world glow
Then you took it all away, mmmm
Just why I'll never know

I'll soon forget in time and smile again
But I can never, never smile as I did then
You took the brightest smile in town, oh yeah
Took it baby and turned it upside down
Oh yeah
You took it and, you turned it upside down
Oh yeah
