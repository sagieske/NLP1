Song:

She said, "boy, you better say you're sorry"
Don't think forgiveness will come easy
'Cause it's all that I have to give
And boy, I get the strangest pleasure
Just sitting on these city roof-tops
And see the lights that go on for miles

And I'm dreaming all the time
My heart is racing, yeah
I'm dreaming all the time
Won't you be mine?

Amber Lynn, I've got three days to keep away
I've been waiting on that white horse, oh for all these days
Amber Lynn, you've got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn won't you be mine
And take me away, tonight

I am stuck between the lines
It just won't come out right
Till I find mine, Till I find mine
Amber Lynn, I won't forget
The simple things you know, you know me best
But I can't seem to find a way in you

Now I'm dreaming all the time
My heart is racing, yeah
I'm dreaming all the time
Won't you be mine?

Amber Lynn, I've got three days to keep away
I've been waiting on that white horse, oh for all these days
Amber Lynn, you've got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn won't you be mine
And take me away

Amber Lynn, you've got me wishing for the stars tonight
And I've been messed up, but oh, you got your trust in time
You saved my life, and I don't ever think I'll find the words to say
Amber Lynn, I've got three days to keep away

Amber Lynn, I've got three days to keep away
I've been waiting on that white horse, oh for all those days
Amber Lynn, you've got me all wrong
Sweet love of mine, bring me closer to that Florida line
Amber Lynn won't you be mine
And take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
Take me away, tonight
