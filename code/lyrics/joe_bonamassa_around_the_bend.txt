Song:

Lord, I've come a long way
And here's what I gotta say
I've paid but I had to pay
To play what I had to play

I was born in the country
Straight in the town
And I'll go anywhere
To see what's going down

I've seen cowards and hero
As fast as the wind
I go down any road there is
To see what's around the bend

And girls, I've had me a few
Some were small and some were cute
I've tasted the honey and dew
Lord, I will be with You

I was born in the country
Straight in the town
And I'd go anywhere
To see what's going down

I've seen cowards and hero
As fast as the wind
I go down any road there is
To see what's around the bend

Can you let me rest my
Weary head, weary head
Let's find out what this life is
Before we're dead
Before we're dead

Lord, I've come a long way
And here's what I have to say
I've paid what I had to pay
Lord, now I'm on my way

I was born in the country
Straight in the town
Well I'll go anywhere
To see what's going down

I've seen cowards and hero
As fast as the wind
I go down any road there is
To see what's around the bend
