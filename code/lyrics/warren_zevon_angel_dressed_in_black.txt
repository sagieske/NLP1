Sitting on the sofa
Suckin' a bowl of crack
Thinkin' to myself about my
Angel dressed in black

I know she went out hours ago
I hope she's coming back
So I wait here patiently for my
Angel dressed in black

I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain

I wish she'd come home right now
So we could interact
I've got a big surprise for her
My angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the Queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black

I'm getting kind of paranoid
I'm going off the track
I'm starting to hallucinate my
Angel dressed in black

She might have been arrested
She might have been arrested
She might be lying dead somewhere
My angel dressed in black

I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain
I don't want to go out in the rain

Sitting on the sofa
Suckin' a bowl of crack
Thinkin' to myself about my
Angel dressed in black

My little angel
She's the Queen of Downtown
She gets around town
My angel dressed in black
