Song:

Anything goes
When everything's gone, anything goes [x3]
Theories without real foundation
Blindfolds entire nations
Idols as big as your bank account is no compromise
Your gods resemble humanity
The irony is they are inferior and nonfunctional in their making
Are we here by chance
That would make our circumstance
Absolutely worthless
Flesh and blood without purpose
Are you part of no bigger scheme
Don't bother with self esteem
Are we all but fading dreams
The vastness of space, the beauty of your face
The artistry of nature, all without a painter
From sunrise to sunset, are we part of this big accident?[x2]
When everything's gone, anything goes [x4]
