[Hook 1: Nelly]
I am so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow, money in the bag
I’m so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tomorrow, money in the bag
[Verse 1: Nelly]
50k today a 100 more tomorrow
Hustle what I want man I’ll forever ball
Money coming heavy never weigh a little
It’s either high or low it’s never in the middle
Ice buckets nigga for the gold Ace
Big cash duffle bag with the gold lace
Heard a nigga say throw in the towel
Numbers speak the truth these niggas out here in denial
[Hook 2: Nelly]
I am so faded, 10,000 square feet gated
100k tomorrow, money in the bag
I’m so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
100k tommorrow, money in the bag
[Verse 2: Nelly]
50k today, 100k tomorrow
Rollie Sundays, Monday Audomar
Tuesday in the photo, Wednesday in the two door
Thursdays made for fucking Fridays back to getting you know
You in that right place again
Face not American, body saying African
Fuck you with an uppercut, baby that won’t take me long
50k today we running money like a marathon
Yo bread, yo bed, yo booty lights on
Her phone playing your music like your music our songs
Give her that banana clip most of all her clothes on
Beatin’ on my chest went through the roof top
[Hook 1]
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
So dope you could snort every line
When it’s reppin’ time, whe when it’s reppin’ time
Told her I take her shoppin’ after we fuck
Soon after we fuck I had to tell her never mind
You wouldn’t know swag if it slapped you in the face
This that macaroni tony A1 on the steak
And designer shoe laces, gold on the bracelets
Got her in the back seat balls on her braces
Photo grails full of money stacks
You a blocker and nigga I got a hundred sacks
Ya, this the luxury distribution
Up so early got me arguing with the rooster
Tru university is my institution
Niggas couldn’t graduate if you had a tutor
One thing for sure, two things for certain
My crib got blinds, my car got curtains
[Hook 1]
