Song:

First born
This infant with his mother's eyes
Is our first born

First child
This baby I hold in my arms
Is our first child

His smile will warm
On a cold winter night

And when life
Is stormy
His faith in me will make things right

First born
Asleep in his crib now
Is our first born

If the good Lord's willing
He'll bless us with many more

But our first born
Is the child we've been praying for
