Song:

I don't even know you anymore
But I think you know
What you mean to me

Things will never be the way
They were before
I guess you can't count on anything

And your brand new friends
They won't care about you
When the party ends
They'll leave you in the dark
Saying tell me where you're hidin'
I think it's time to come back home

You taught me everything I know
About poetry
I still pretend I know what it means

Remember picking out who we wanna be
Back when we didn't know anything

And your brand new friends
They won't care about you
When the party ends
They'll leave you in the dark
Saying tell me where you're hidin'
I think it's time to come back home

Every night since you've been gone
I still leave the light on
I know it's wrong, to wait so long

You say you're getting on just fine
But you still stutter when you lie
I know you better
Tell me would you come back home

And your brand new friends
They won't care about you
When the party ends
They'll leave you in the dark
Saying tell me where you're hidin'
I think it's time to come back home
Come back home
I think it's time you come back home
