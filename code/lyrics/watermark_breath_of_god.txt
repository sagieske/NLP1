Song:

Chorus
Breath of God, breathe on us
We adore You, come before You
To magnify Your name

Breath of God, fill this place
With your spirit drawing near us
We'll never be the same

Mighty God
You are endless in power and mercy
Be glorified
We exalt You and lift up Your name
Lord of all
King of heaven and earth
You are holy, holy

Breath of God breathe on us
Come so sweetly and completely
As we seek Your face

Breath of God, reign in our hearts
And restore us, stay before us
To lead us all our days

Chorus

Mighty God
You are endless in power and mercy
Be glorified
We exalt You and lift up Your name
Lord of all
King of heaven and earth
You are holy, holy, holy, holy
Breath of God, breathe on us
