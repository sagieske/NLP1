Song:

All the rules you break
Make me wanna run but I can't escape
All the things you say
Most of them are lies but I'm listening
La la la la la, la la la la la
That's my heart talking to my head- head, 
Talking to my heart
La la la la la, la la la la la
That's my heart talking to my head- head
Saying that
You're a bad boy, I'm a good girl
And I'm gonna get my heart broken in time
You're a bad boy, baby your world
Is gonna chew me up and spit me out alive
If I could help myself you know I would
Why do the bad boys always look so good?
Baby when you smile
I can see the trouble that's in your eyes
When you touch me there
I know for certain I'm losing all control
La la la la la, la la la la la
That's my heart talking to my head- head, 
Talking to my heart
La la la la la, la la la la la
That's my heart talking to my head- head
Saying that
You're a bad boy, I'm a good girl
And I'm gonna get my heart broken in time
You're a bad boy, baby your world
Is gonna chew me up and spit me out alive
If I could help myself you know I would
Why do the bad boys always look so good
I gotta let you go, I gotta let you go go go... 
I gotta let you go
You're a bad boy, I'm a good girl
And I'm gonna get my heart broken in time
You're a bad boy, baby your world
Is gonna chew me up and spit me out alive
If I could help myself you know I would
Why do the bad boys always look so good?
Lalalalala, that's my heart saying that
