Song:

Lani

by Larry Kaplan

1. Blue skies, white clouds, fish jumpin' in your hand
What a day to be fishin' ole Nantucket sound
From the island up to the mainland

Chorus:

Get me my fiddle we'll sing all old songs
You take the high notes, and I'll take the low
Good times and hard times, there all worth the telling
It don't matter to me that you sing 'em that well.

2. I remember the days when you worked for a living
Pulling hard just to get back to shore
And you busted your back and you didn't get dinner
we don't talk much of that anymore
3. Stayed up with the old folks, fell asleep to their stories
Played a tune to the hollerin' wind
Sang a song while the children were put away warm
And the night tides came rollin' back in.

4. Worn out, smellin' of bait,
Come home when the wind blows you home
And the sun over west chalk, the warm summer breezes
Make you think that things never will change.

(repeat first verse)
