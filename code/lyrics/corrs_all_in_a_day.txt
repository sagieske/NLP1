Song:

All in a day, she saw the face in the mirror lie
To her dismay, she saw the child that was in her die
And she cried... Overnight
Cause what she sees... She doesn't like

I'm twisting (twisting..., twisting...)
I'm turning (turning..., turning...)
I'm aching (aching..., aching...)
And it's burning
In one day..., in one day

Just let me float, just let me drift on by (just let me drift on by...)
No more, no pain
I don't have tears to cry (tears to cry...)

I'm twisting (twisting..., twisting...)
I'm turning (turning..., turning...)
I'm aching (aching..., aching...)
And it's burning
In one day
In one day
In one day

[Violin solo]

I'm twisting, I'm turning
In one day...
In one day (in one day...)
In one day
In one day (in one day...)
