Song:

1) Life can take us down some hard roads and we know not where to turn
Then we realize that we're all alone just the sound of one voice in the night
Its a way of keeping things real, real life, a way of seeing yourself from the outside in
And it keeps our hearts beating so fast to the rythms of our soul the fear of life


Bridge-
When life turns you upside down
You look for love it can't be found
And people treat you like a clown
When life turns you upside down


-- so when im all alone, I think of these times
And then I'm groovin with you, begins to ease my mind


2) Let the sounds escape into your heart explore the love that you can feel
There's no trick to being real if you turn it on then you can do no wrong
Get lost in the rhymes and you'll find that you can twist and shout it out
Everyday i'm writing my songs I share em with you......... I hope you will sing along


Chorus -
Gotta open on up, gotta let it all out
Gotta open your mind, mind, mind, to what we're talking about
Twist and shout it out everybody twist and shout it out


--so when im all alone I think of these times
And then im groovin with you, begins to ease my mind


3) If your serious about your life, get serious about your love
Cause what you throw out to the world will come right back and give you what we need
Because music is revelation when your looking for a sweet sensation sensual medication makes you high
Its a groove meditation, a soul saving occupation, put your head on vacation for the night


Chorus
