Song:

I'll give you all I've got to give
It's never too late to say I'm sorry
We have one life to live, 
That'll be the beginning of a great story
You are my sun in the darkness of the night, 
You are my ice land on the sea of memories
You are my sun in the darkness of the night
And be my eyes when I lose my sight

I like your whispering in the dark
There are whispers of the past
You are hiding deep inside my dreams, 
Dreaming the final dream, the last
I like your whispering in the dark
There are whispers of the past
You are hiding deep inside my dreams, 
Dreaming the final dream, the last

Give me more than you can take, 
Then I'll give us a second chance
We have one life to live, 
I'll give you all I've got to give
Like a moonlight, you're showing me the way, 
Like heroine
You course in my veins, 
Like a moonlight, you're showing me the way, 
Like heroine
You course in my veins

I like your whispering in the dark
There are whispers of the past
You are hiding deep inside my dreams, 
Dreaming the final dream, the last
I like your whispering in the dark
There are whispers of the past
You are hiding deep inside my dreams, 
Dreaming the final dream, the last
