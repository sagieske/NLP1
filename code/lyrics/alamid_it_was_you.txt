Song:

I.
I've long to hold your hand
To touch your lips with mine
It was you who seized my mind
You've given me all the signs
Refrain1:
That I will be there to stay, so tight
Our love will give us might
Tonight and forever
I'll be alright

Ii.
Taught me how to live again
Though no one really cares
No more tears and lonely days
You came and threw them away
Refrain2:
That I will be there to stay, so tight
Our love will give us might
You changed my life for a moment

Chorus:
It was you who pulled my senses
And created what I am
It was you and not all sadness
Who filled my emptiness

I can't state the reason why you should be mine
And if you tried to listen
Fate is really kind

Repeat refrain 2 and chorus (2x)
It was you who pulled my senses
And created what I am
