Song:

Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah

You said "I got something to say",
Then you got that look in your eye.
"There is something you've got to know"
You said it as you started to cry.

I've been down the wrong road tonight,
And I swear I'll never go there again.
I've seen this face once before,
And I don't think I can do this again

There's something I can't see,
Something different in the way you smile.
Behind those eyes you lie.
And there's nothing I can say,
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind.
Behind those eyes you hide.

As you turned to walk away,
I saw another look in your eye.
And even though it hurt like it did,
I couldn't let this be a goodbye.

You say that you're sorry,
And you say that it hurts you the same.
Is there something here to believe,
Or is it just another part of the game?

There's something I can't see,
Something living in the way you smile.
Behind those eyes you lie.
And there's nothing I can say,
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind.
Behind those eyes you hide.

Ohh yeah
Ooooooo
Ohh woah

Behind those eyes you lie.
Behind those eyes you hide.

There's something I can't see,
Something living in the way you smile.
Behind those eyes you lie.
And there's nothing I can say,
Cause I'm never gonna change your mind.
Behind those eyes you hide.

There's nothing I can say,
Cause I'm never gonna make change your mind.
Behind those eyes you hide.

Behind those eyes you lie.
