Song:

All the feeling
Leaving you
Till you left alone inside a hollow shell
Twice repeated
Me then you
Till your left alone not knowing who to blame
But I, I see the handle to the hilt
You know I'm always pulling
But they, they won't stop
They won't stop pushing
I remember
Feeling guilty
Was it something I did?
Or was it what I said?

It's not you, it's not me
The situations telling us to be
Not you, not me
It's what the world has left us to be
