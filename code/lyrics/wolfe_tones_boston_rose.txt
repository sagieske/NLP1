Song:

Now the autumm leaves are falling and the tourists have all gone
And the children they have all gone back to school
And my life is as it was before
I work eight hours a day but the company's still making all the rules

But there's a girl in Massachusetts south of Boston town she said
And her lovely face is with me all the day
Sure I met her down in old Tralee, golden hair upon her head
And I took her heart and she stole mine away

[Chorus:]
Goodbye my Boston beauty farewell my Boston rose
I'll wait for you I'll think of you no threat to you I'll pose
Goodbye my Boston beauty farewell my Boston rose
I wish that you were here but I know that's the way life goes

There's a song we sang all summer in the bars in Dublin town
I can hear it on the factory radio
And the feelings I remember when I hear that simple tune
Make me wonder if it really happened so
For we laughed and loved together 'til the summer days were gone
And she had to fly across, the ocean wide
So goodbye my boston beauty, until we meet again
And I'll keep the fire burnin deep inside [Repeat Chorus]

And some nights when I'm drinking and my friends have gathered 'round
Well just for fun someone Brings up your name
Well I smile there with the rest of them but I can't here a sound
I love you but to them it's all the same
And nights when I'm alone my love you come into my mind
And visions flash across the Emerald Isle
Well I watch the moon there up above I'll leave this earth behind
And I'll call to you as I go sailing by

[Repeat Chorus]
