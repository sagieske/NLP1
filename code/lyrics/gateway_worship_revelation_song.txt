Worthy is the,
Lamb who was slain
Holy, Holy, is He
Sing a new song, to Him who sits on
Heaven's Mercy Seat
[Repeat 2x]

Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
With all creation I sing:
Praise to the King of Kings!
You are my everything,
And I will adore You...!
Yeah!

Clothed in rainbows, of living color
Flashes of lightning, rolls of thunder
Blessing and honor, strength and
Glory and power be
To You the Only Wise King,
Yeah

Holy, Holy, Holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come, yeah

Praise to the King of Kings!
You are my everything,
And - I - will - adore You!

Filled with wonder,
Awestruck wonder
At the mention of Your Name
Jesus, Your Name is Power
Breath, and Living Water
Such a marvelous mystery
Yeah...

Holy, Holy, Holy

Who was, and is, and is to come, yeah

You are my everything,
And - I - will - adore You!

Who was, and is, and is to come,
With all creation I sing:

You are my everything,
And - I - will - adore YOU...

Come up lift up His Name
To the King of Kings...
We will adore YOU Lord...
King of heaven and earth
King Jesus, King Jesus
Aleluya, aleluya, aleluya!
Majesty, awestruck Honor
And Power and Strength and Dominion
To You Lord,
To the King, to King
To the King of Glory
