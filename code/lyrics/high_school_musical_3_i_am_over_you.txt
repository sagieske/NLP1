Song:

[Gabriella:]
Here I am once again,
Picking up the pieces,
Of the mess you've made,
I'm over you spoiling the fun,
Give it a rest,
Clean your own mess.

[Chorus:]
You have no control,
Over everything that's passed.
Leave it be,
Don't mess with me,
I am over you,
And over what you've done.

[Sharpay:]
You always get what you want,
What about me?
I've had my losses too,
Tokens you took from me. Ooooh.
I am over you.
The spotlight belongs to me.
Tonight.

[Chorus:]

[Gabriella:]
Is all this pain a part of your game?

[Sharpay:]
You were the one who started this!

[gabriella and sharpay]

I'm tierd of ur crap that you pulled with troy

[Gabriella]
Troys is mine!!!!

[Sharpay]

Not for long

[Gabriella:]
Keep yourself out of my life (it's mine)

[Sharpay:]
But you were the one to enter mine first,

[Gabriella:]
I've kept to myself, and kept my friends close

[Sharpay:]
Yet I've always been your enemy?

[Chorus:]

[Sharpay:]
I've seen you as a threat, never as a foe

[Gabriella:]
But you tried to hurt the ones I loved?

[Sharpay:]
Does getting what I want make me a threat?

[Gabriella:]
It's what you do that makes you so.

[Sharpay:]
It's who I am, and I won't change

[Gabriella:]
Then you'll find yourself as you are now.

[Sharpay & Gabriella:]
Stay away from me.
I am over you
