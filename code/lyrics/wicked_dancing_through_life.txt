Fiyero:
The trouble with schools is
They always try to teach the wrong
Lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow
Less shallow
But I say: why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live "the unexamined life"

Dancing through life
Skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless
For the brainless
Why think too hard?
When it's so soothing
Dancing through life
No need to tough it
When you can sluff it off as I do
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
Its just life
So keep dancing through...

Dancing through life
Swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught less
When you're thoughtless
Those who don't try
Never look foolish
Dancing through life
Mindless and careless
Make sure your where less
Trouble in life
Woes are fleeting
Blows are glancing
When you're dancing
Through life...
So-what's the most swankified place in town?

Galinda:
That would be the Ozdust Ballroom

Fiyero:
Sounds perfect.
Lets go down to the ozdust ballroom
We'll meet their later tonight
We can dance till it's light
Find the prettiest girl...
Give 'er a whirl
Right on down to the ozdust ballroom
Come on~~follow me
You'll be happy to be there...

All:
Dancing through life
Down at the ozdust...

Fiyero:
If only because dust is what we come to...

All:
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
Its just life...

Fiyero:
So keep dancing through...

Boq:
Miss galinda- I hope you'll save at least one
Dance for me. I'll be right there. Waiting. All night

Galinda:
Oh- that's so kind. But you know what would
Be even kinder?
See that trigic'ly beautiful girl
The one in the chair
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree
And not she
Gee-
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were
To go invite her...

Boq:
Well, maybe-i could invite her!

Galinda:
Oh, bick, really?
You would do that for me!?

Boq:
I would do anything for you, miss galinda

Galinda:
So...

Fiyero:
So i'll be picking you up around eight?

Galinda:
After all-
Now that we've met one another...

Fiyero and Galinda:
Its clear- we deserve each other

Galinda:
You're perfect...

Fiyero:
You're perfect...

Both:
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever...
Dancing through life...

Nessarose
"Oh elphaba- isn't it wonderful?
Fin'lly, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this munchkin boy
Galinda found for me
And I only wish there were
Something I could do for her
To repay her
Elphaba see?
We deserve each other
And galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other
Me and boq...
Elphaba, please, try to understand...

Elphaba:
I do...

Elphaba:
Galinda- nessa and I were talking about you
Just now-

Galinda:
And I was just talking about you! I thought you
Might want to wear this hat to the party tonight!
It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know- black is this years pink
You deserve eachother
This hat and you
You're both so smart
You deserve eachother
So here, out of the goodness of my
Heart...

Boq:
Listen- nessa-

Nessarose:
Yes?

Boq:
Uh- nessa
I've got something to confess, a
Reason why, well-
Why I asked you here tonight
Now I know it isn't fair...

Nessarose:
Oh, Boq, I know why.

Boq:
You do?

Nessarose:
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well- isn't that right?

Boq:
No! No! It's because... Because...
Because you are so beautiful!

Nessarose:
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance?
We deserve each other
Don't we boq?

Boq:
You know what? Lets dance...

Nessarose:
What?

Boq:
Let's dance!

All:
Dancing through life
Down at the ozdust
If only because dust
Is what we come to
And the strange thing:
Your life could end up changing
While your dancing
Through!
