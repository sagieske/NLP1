Intro verse:
I've got feelings for a friend
But I don't, I don't know how to tell him
And how I want to feel his love
But I'm scared
Oh so scared to tell you
(oooh)

Chorus
So baby can you love me?
'Cause I need to feel your love
So baby can you love me (love me)
So baby can you love me?
'Cause I need to feel your love
So baby can you love me (love me)

Verse I
I don't want nobody else
I just want you for myself
Everybody knows I got feelings for you
(ooh)
We've been cool since we've been kids
But I can't go on being friends
You're always on my mind
Ooh baby I think I'm falling for you
It's true

Chorus

Verse ii
People say we look good together
You say we'll be friends forever
I hold my feelings in everybody knows it but you
It's true (yeah)
Come on baby won't you look at me
I'm not your sista I'm your lover to be
(I know it sounds funny)
I think I'm in love with you
It's true

Chorus (x4)
