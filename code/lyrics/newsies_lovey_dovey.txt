ANNOUNCER:(Speaking)
And now gents, the moment you've all been waiting for. The sensational songbird. The Swedish Meadowlark, Miss Medda Larkson.
MEDDA:
My lovey dovey baby
I boo-hoo-hoo for you
I used to be your tootsie-wootsie
Then you said 'tooldle-dedoo'
I miss the hanky-panky
Each nighty-night til three
Come back my lovey dovey baby
And coochie-coo with me
