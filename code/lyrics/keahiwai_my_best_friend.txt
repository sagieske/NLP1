Song:

Sometimes we've got angels watching over us
Every minute of the day
And sometimes they send down a special friend
Who will walk with you through the rain
And when I feel the world is against me
You're the one I call to help me spread my wings.
So in return my dear friend
It's for you this song I sing
Just call on me whenever you need a shoulder to cry on
I will never leave you lonely
Until the end, oh I promise you you'll always be my best friend
I know I can do all the things I want
With the love and support you bring
And I know that I'll never have to be afraid
You encourage me to live my dreams
And though I know that life is full of change
My feelings will always be the same
You'll always hold a place in my heart even if we're apart
Just call on me whenever you need a shoulder to cry on
I will never leave you lonely
Until the end, oh I promise you you'll always be my best friend
You're my best friend
Your'e my best friend
You're my best friend
