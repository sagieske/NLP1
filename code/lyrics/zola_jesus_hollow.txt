Song:

[Verse:]
Under the tissue
You never knew it all
And no love is versions
Your eyes and falls
Here comes with all the saying
You wish you would be weighing
It knocks on your all
You're never gonna see right
If you grow old

[Pre-Chorus:]
Seconds roll up
Before you can grow up
And when it comes ease down, it's hollow
Minutes go by
Before you close those eyes
And everyone breaks down twice

[Chorus:]
It's gonna go, it's gonna be hollow
Just gotta let it go, let it go
It's gonna go, it's gonna be hollow
Just gotta let it go, let it go

[Verse 2:]
It's a syndrome I never knew it was right
It's the final drum to the end of the pay
The phone packs is square, the fog hits the air
It's never the same, it's never the same
Oh, it's never the same, oh

[Chorus: X2]
It's gonna go, it's gonna be hollow
Just gotta let it go, let it go
It's gonna go, it's gonna be hollow
Just gotta let it go, let it go
