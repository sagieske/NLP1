Song:

God only knows how far you've come
It must be light years from here
Some distant star you call the sun
Does someone miss you back there?

Another world is calling you
Another world is coming through

You look like me, you talk like me
I could believe you're human
But late at night, I catch your eye
And I know what you're thinking

Another world is calling you
Another world is coming through
Calling you to come home

You can't escape from gravity
For you, this earth's a prison
What I would call human in me
For you would be perversion

Another world is calling you
