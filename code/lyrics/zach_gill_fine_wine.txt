Song:

Maybe we didn't write the book. Maybe we left out that page.
Or maybe we're like fine wine, getting better with age.

Well I think it's time that you arrived inside your heart and inside your mind,
Cause you're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.

You're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.
You're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.

Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.

And I know you've got regrets, and I know you feel undone.
But when I look at your life, it looks to me like your life has been made out of love.
And I think it's time that you arrived inside your heart and inside your mind,
Cause you're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.

You're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.
You're beautiful and I see it, and I see you starting to believe it.

Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
Believing it's true.
