Song:

I'm feelin' down
How you wanted long
Now you dream's shattered
And you lost all hope
Oh yeah
All you need is music
It's your destiny
It sets you free
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whooooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whoooa
If you raise your hands
You can stamp your feet
Get down, turn around
You can do it all for Ray Noll
When you feel the music
Just move your feet
To the healthy beat
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whooooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whoooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whooooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whoooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whooooa
Whooooa
All you need is rock 'n roll
Whoooa
