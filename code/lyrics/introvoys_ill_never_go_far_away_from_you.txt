Song:

You always ask me those words I say
And telling me what it means to me

REFRAIN
Every single day, you always act this way
For how many times I've told you
I love you for this is all I know

Come to me and hold me and you will see
The love I give for you still hold the key

Every single day, you always act this way
For how many times I've told you
I love you for this is all I know

CHORUS
I'll never go far away from you
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

Come to me and hold me and you will see
The love I give for you still hold the key

Every single day, you always act this way
For how many times I've told you
I love you for this is all I know

I'll never go far away from you
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

Instrumental

I'll never go far away from you
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

I'll never go far away from you
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

I'll never go (never go) far away from you
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

(I'll never go far away from you)
Even this sky will tell you that I need you so
For this is all I know (I know)
I'll never go far away from you

(I'll never go, never go away)
(I'll never go away, never go)
