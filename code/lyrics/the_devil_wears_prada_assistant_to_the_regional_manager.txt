Song:

These writings are to those who have weeped.
These writings are to those who haven't looked deeply enough into the correct resolution.

Wrong again but stronger now, we can face this.
Fight life with life.
Fight life with life.

All glory to the one in existence. Bring upon your name, your grace, your everything.

Hold hands and stare into the circle.
What are we looking at?

Rumors and rumors and rumors.
Rumors and rumors and rumors.

Assembly: disintegration.

Rumors and rumors and rumors.

Perish.

Tombstones serve as mirrors and the graves are infinite.
Take a look through the lens and through your eyes.
End the partitioning.

Wrong again but stronger now, we can face this.
Fight life with life.
Fight life with life.

Enemies, we'll go for your throat.
