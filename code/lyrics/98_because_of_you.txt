Song:

It's all... It's all... It's all...
You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind
When you're not around
It's all... It's all...
It's all because of you

You're my sunshine
Oh yeah...

Baby I really know by now
Since we met that day
You showed me the way
I felt it then you gave me love
I can't describe
How much I feel for you

I said baby I should have known by now
Should have been right there
Whenever you needed love
And if only you were here
I'd tell you, yes I'd tell you
Oh yeah...

Chorus:
You're my sunshine after the rain
You're the cure against my fear and my pain
'Cause I'm losing my mind
When you're not around
It's all... It's all...
It's all because of you

Honestly, could it be you and me
Like it was before
Neither less or more
'Cause when I close my eyes
At night I realize that no one else
Could ever take your place

I still can feel and it's so unreal
When you're touching me Kisses endlessly
It's just a place in the sun
Where our love's begun
I miss you... Yes I miss you

Chorus

If I knew how to tell you
What's on my mind
Make you understand
Then I'd always be there
Right by your side

Chorus
