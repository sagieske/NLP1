Song:

Heavy Metal in the night
Deadly soldiers came to eat you alive
Final battle for the wild
Mental warfare of the scorpion tribe
Blood invasion - Out to fight
In a circle - We're the servants of light

Stay - Better start to pray
Killing me today
Feel the war inside yourself
And burn them all away

Leather hides my face
Blood is on my trace
Until the end of days

Behind the leathermask
Behind the leathermask

Savage union - Strong and wild
Wolves of darkness
We're the murderous five
Fire warning in the night
Cities burning
Killed by serpents of might

Stay - Better start to pray
Killing me today
Feel the war inside yourself
And burn them all away

Leather for the night
Prophecies of might
Dying side by side

Here comes the leather...
Here comes the leathermask
