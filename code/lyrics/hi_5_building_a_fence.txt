Song:

You want the cows over here
You want the sheep staying near
Don't want the horses munching on the yard
Shooing off the goats is much too hard
You need the pigs staying in their pens
You need a place for the hens
Only one thing that makes any sense
You need to build a big long fence
Building a fence
Building a fence
That's the only thing that makes any sense
Building a fence
Building a fence
That's the only thing that makes any sense
