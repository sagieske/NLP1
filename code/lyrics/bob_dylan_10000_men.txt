Song:

10. 000 men on a hill
10. 000 men on a hill
Some of them going down some of them gonna get killed.

10. 000 men dressed in Oxford blue
10. 000 men dressed in Oxford blue
Drummin in the morning in the evening they'll be coming for you.

10. 000 men on the move
10. 000 men on the move
None of them doing nothing that your mama wouldn't disapprove.

10. 000 men diggin' for silver and gold
10. 000 men diggin' for silver and gold
All clean shaven all coming from the cold.

Hey who could you lover be?
Hey who could you lover be?
Let me eat off his head and you can really see.

10. 000 women all dressed in white
10. 000 women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me goodnight.

10. 000 men looking so lean and frail
10. 000 men looking so lean and frail
Each one of them got seven wives each of them just out of jail.

10. 000 women all sleep in my room
10. 000 women all sleep in my room
Spilling my buttermilk sweeping it up with a broom.

Mmm baby thank you for my tea
Hey baby thank you for my tea
It's really so sweet of you to be so nice to me.
