Song:

God only knows how he must have felt
Out on the mountain where Abraham knelt
Though deep in his heart I'm sure it hurt to obey
Still he offered his son as if to say
Chorus
I'm Willing to live
Willing to die
Willing to make any sacrifice
I'm willing to go
Willing to stay
Lord, theres no price too high for me to pay
Any struggle that might come my way
I'm willing to go through
Just as long as my heart
As long as my heart knows its you.
How many times have you called for me
When my heart was willing but I was so weak
What I would give if I could only believe
That when I'm tested by fire Ill always be
Repeat chorus
