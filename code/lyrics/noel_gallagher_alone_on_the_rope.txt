Song:

I won't let your smile
Get lost in the fall
I won't let your dreams
Run away in the dark

Still recall the way you were
And that look in your eyes
Still recall the way you were
And that look in your eyes

Can't hear the sound
A thought ringing in my ear
I still feel the pain
I carried with me for years

Still recall the way you were
And that look in your eyes
Still recall the way you were
And that look in your eyes

You could leave when the walls fall down
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You're alone on the rope
And if you can't find no hope
Don't look down
Don't look down

You could leave when the wall falls down
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You're alone on the rope
And if you can't find no hope
Don't look down
Don't look down
