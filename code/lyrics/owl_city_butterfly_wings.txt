Song:

If I was a raindrop
Would you be my thunderstorm
It's cold, so surround me
With rain clouds to keep me warm
I feel like I'm falling
So Darling, don't let me go
The thought is appalling
But should I slip away into the stormy sea
Will you remember me

Asleep in our warm cocoons
We dream of lovely things
We're both gonna wake up soon
So we hope that tomorrow brings us our butterfly wings

If I was a grain of sand
Would you be Miami Beach
So dusty with starlight
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me
I'll try not to wake you
Or make a sound while you're dozing off
But in the night should the high tides
Sweep me away from you
Tell me again my dear, will you be waiting here

Whenever we leave the ground
And take to the sky
I'll smile as I'm gazing down
Cause I've always wondered why we won't need feathers to fly
