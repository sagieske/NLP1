Song:

The sun should be halfway to china by now
The big lazy moon, well it's barely off of the ground
I'm on top of the world but my world is upside down
And all I have is You

Come closer, closer than ever
So close to me
Come closer, closer than ever
When I have You, I have all I need

They all expect me to have some great words to say
I'm searching for answers but I'm finding none today
There is no reason, you know, there is no rhyme
All I have is You

All I need is all I have
All I have is all I need
All I need is all I have
All I have is all I need is
All I have is all I need is You
