Song:

Ooo Whatcha gonna do now
Whatcha gonna do when they rhythm comes kicken you
Tryin to make me bleed in to
My resent so definite evident

Breath life a disease gonna get you
Off of me
Thoughts of you rotting me
Animosity grows into me
Boy you lost when you made me the enemy

Blood in my eyes Blood in my eyes

I don't like to think
I don't like to think about you
No
Whatcha gonna do
Who your gonna do it to
Cause it's makin me feel
Yeah it's makin me feel (my real)
Somethin I killed off

Given off enough a lick about you
To another like me punk
Gonna get yourself knocked down

Blood in my eyes Blood in my eyes

Nightmares running through my mind

Walked the path it warped my brain
Never left me quiet insane
All the memories of my pain
Looking down as I remain
So Empty
Inside Me
So Empty

Hey You
Look into my face
Can't you see my grip
Yeah feelin just about to kick it
My innocence feeding your arrogance
I guess you gave no thoughts to your madness
Who you trying to fool now
Who you trying to get to limit the insanity anew now
Animosity
Grows into me
Waiting for anything
I'm making you the enemy

Walked the path it warped my brain
Never left me quiet insane
All the memories of my pain
Looking down as I remain
So Empty
Inside Me
So Empty

Rage in my veins
I can not remain
Thinkin how you let me down
Oh end my pain
I can not remain
Why don't you just let me drown

Ooo Whatcha gonna do now
Whatcha gonna do when they rhythm comes kicken you
Now your makin me bleed in to
Nightmares runnin through my mind
Breath like a disease gonna get you off of me
Thoughts of you rotting me
Boy you lost when you made me the enemy

Ooo like I never new
Just trusted you
Every single time I think of you
Rape my mind to make me blind
Thought that I'd forget it boy
I'll hit you with he blind side

No stoppin it
Watch me droppin it
Off of me
Another nightmare rocking it
Animosity grows into me
Boy you lost now I made you the enemy

Walked the path it warped my brain
Never left me quite insane
All the memories of my pain
Looking down as I remain
So Empty
Inside Me
So Empty
