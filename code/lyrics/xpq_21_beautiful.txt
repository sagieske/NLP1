Song:

It's too late, in L. A. It's too late
Look at you, look at you
Is that the face you wanted?

You don't see, you don't rock
And feed the machine
Wasted precious years

You feel good
You feel free
Live your lifestyle
You have no troubles
You have no regrets

Lost in victories of your illusions of your broken dreams
Don't leave your path

But you don't have to change your mind, 'cause you're

Beautiful
You're beautiful
No matter what you say and what you do
Beautiful
Created for a plastic world

And I see your plastic
You foxy lady
Where are you, where are you
Your mind is playing tricks

Buy your magazines
And learn your lifestyle
Lost in victories of your dreams,
Wake up...
