Song:

[Chorus:]
It's All About You
I'm So Glad That I Have Found
The One Who Turned My Life Around
Made My World A Better Place To Live

It's All About You
I'm So Glad You Came This Way
Made My Darkness Turn To Day
Now It's For You I Will Live

So Many Days, In So Many Ways
I Took For Granted All Tha You Planted
In My Life For Me To Enjoy

Since I Was A Little Boy
Now My Eyes Are Open
So I Can See All You've Done For Me
You Made My Life Complete
So Much Joy To Me You Bring
So Forever I'll Lift My Voice And Sing

[Chorus:]

[Repeat Above Verse]

For You
All I Do Is For You

Even In My Darkest Hour
You Are There To Give Me Power
I'm So Glad I Found Peace I You
