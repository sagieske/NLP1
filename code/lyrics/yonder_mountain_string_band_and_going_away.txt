Song:

I'll tell you it's sad but true
I'm saying goodbye to you
Leaves me nowhere at all
No place to fall, nothin' but blue

Tell me and tell me now
As sweet as you can somehow
That you'll miss me each day
And that goin' away is only your style

'Cause I'll wake up at night and feel
The face in the dream was real
But I'm nowhere at all
No place to fall, nothin' but blue

I'll tell you it's sad but it's true
I'm already missin' you
And you ain't even gone
I'm already stoned with nothin' to do

I'm thinkin' I've had enough
The fool in me's feelin' rough
You left me days without end
Got crazy again
Kept smokin' the stuff
