Song:

They tell you a good girl is quiet
And that you should never ask why
'Cause it only makes it harder to fit in
You should be happy, excited
Even if you're just invited
'Cause the winners need
Someone to clap for them
It's so hard, just waiting
In a line that never moves
It's time you started making
Your own rules

[Chorus:]
You gotta scream until
There's nothing left
With your last breath, so
Here I am, here I am
Make'em listen
'Cause there is no way you'll be ignored
Not anymore, say
Here I am, here I am
Here I am, here I am

You only get one life to work it
So who care's if it's not perfect
Say, "it's close enough to perfect for me"
Why should you hide from the thunder
And the lightning that you're under
'Cause there ain't nobody else
You want to be
If how your living isn't working
There's one thing that'll help
You got to finally just stop searching
To find yourself

[Chorus:]

The world better make some room
Yeah, move over, over.
Cause you're coming through
Cause you're coming through

[Chorus:]
