Song:

Light will come to those who wait
From the shadows souls awake
For these are the days when the nations will bow at the coming king

All our kingdoms fall with the mountains
And our empires crash into the sea
For these are the days when the nations will rise for the coming king

All gods children we will sing hallelujah

Hope will come to those who wait
As the heart of heaven breaks
For these are the days when the least of us all see the coming king
For these are the days when injustice will fall at the coming king

There will come a day when this will all fall away
And we'll be singing hallelujah
