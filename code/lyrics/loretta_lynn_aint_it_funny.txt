Song:

The sun comes up and brings the dawn turn to day
The kids run out to play the game like kids all play
To child the world is milk and honey a dime is a lot a can be money
Oh ain't it funny now ain't it funny
Running barefoot through the fields in the rain
Chasin' pretty butterflies in the lane
The world's a mess and they wonder why oh what a pretty blue blue sky
Gee ain't it funny now ain't it funny
The kids all say grown ups are strange and aren't they
They teach their kids not to do as I do but as I say
They cry for peace and then make wars and wonder what they're fighting for
Oh ain't it funny now ain't it funny
Oh gee ain't it funny now ain't it funny
