Song:

Now taste
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
So hold on to surrender

She shakes
Like I'm on a railway
Ch-ch-checking me out
Someone on a shoulder

Her lamp
Slippers in her bedroom
She must feel it's awkward
Whorehouse Arizona

Now go
Stand up to a giant
Said that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk toï¿½

Shake hands
My face
Standin on a treadmill
Tastin something awful
I hate when that happens

She waits
In and out of Texas
She must be plum crazy
I kinda think I like her
I kinda think I do
