Song:

Why don't you just go away?
I can't seem to get my head straight
There's so much I need to say
It could take all day, yeah

But what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Your bad mood just ties my hands
Turn my cartwheels into headstands
I've done everything I can
To get all I had, yeah

But what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons, why?

You don't help me now
So worn down, so torn up
Still in love, yeah

But what you got, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Woman, I don't need it
I can't listen to all your reasons
Wake up, I don't feel it
I can't listen to all your reasons

Why, do I? Tell me why
Oh, tell me why
Oh baby, tell me why?
