Song:

Yesterday you said you love me today you say it's over now
Why did you go away and leave me all the world is lonely now
Don't tell me that you love another and that you've broken every vow
For I don't want to live without you all the world is lonely now
[ piano ]
I tried so hard to make you happy with love your heart would not allow
It's hard to know you'll never love me all the world is lonely now
(All the world is lonely now)
