Song:

Yeah.
I taste it. I need it.
How many? And I won't be part of it
I'd rather sold myself; be part of the dream
Pissing away life. I'm just getting older
My life is over
I'm gonna do

A public puppet. Just pull my string.
You say, "Jump!" I say, "How high?"

I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.

One of you fuckheads could play my s**t
I don't know when my body's calling it quits

I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.

Trying to be afloat. Try to think of a?
I have to do something just to stay alive
Tired of feeling alone trying to reach a goal
There's some s**t I don't want no more

I live it. I breathe it.
It's my god and I get hungry without.
I taste it. I see it.
A public puppet is what I am.
