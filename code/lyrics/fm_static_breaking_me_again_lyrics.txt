Song:

I'm feelin' trapped inside this house, 
The words I want, they won't come out, 
Feel like a ghost inside these walls, 
It's like no one sees me at all

I want to say, what I want to say, 
And hope no fear gets in the way, 
But whether I succeed or not, 
Help me heal this broken heart

When everything seems crazy, 
And I don't know If I can take it, 
I know, I need a little more help than I've ever had, 
And a little more love than I've had yet
I feel shaken, 
And I don't know if I can make it, 
I know, I need a little more faith than if I believe, 
'Cause every step I take, you're breaking me again

I get so lost inside my head, 
I'm saying things I've never said, 
The prayers I want, they won't come out, 
A war between confidence and doubt

I want to say what I want to say, 
And hope no fear gets in the way, 
But whether I succeed or not, 
Help me heal this broken heart

When everything seems crazy, 
And I don't know If I can take it, 
I know, I need a little more help than I've ever had, 
And a little more love than I've had yet
I feel shaken, 
And I don't know if I can make it, 
I know, I need a little more faith than if I believe, 
'Cause every step I take, you're breaking me again

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Repeat]

When everything seems crazy, 
And I don't know If I can take it, 
I know, I need a little more help than I've ever had, 
And a little more love than I've had yet
When everything feels shaken, 
And I don't know if I can make it, 
I know, I need a little more faith than if I believe, 
'Cause every step I take, you're breaking me again

When everything seems crazy, 
And I don't know If I can take it, 
I know, I need a little more help than I've ever had, 
And a little more love than I've had yet
I feel shaken, 
And I don't know if I can make it, 
I know, I need a little more faith than if I believe, 
'Cause every step I take, you're breaking me again

'Cause every step I take, you're breaking me again
