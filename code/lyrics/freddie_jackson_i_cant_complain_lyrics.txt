Song:

Over and over, everyday
You're better than before
The love that you show me in your special way
Just makes me want you more

In love that knows no fear
You're my lover, my best friend
I'll never let you go, oh, no, no, no

Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

You make love so easy every night
With you I come alive
And how you'd believe in love this good
And you're the reason why

The love beyond compare
What we feel and what we share
I'll never let you go

Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Just to be with you from now on
I'll make any sacrifice
Whatever it takes, I'm willing to do
For you I'd make the prayers

And love that never ends
You're my lover and my best friend
I'll never let you go, oh no, no, no

Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Baby, baby, I just can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Baby, baby
Baby, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Baby, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, baby

Baby, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel
Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Baby, baby
Baby, I said, baby, I can't complain
About the way that you make me feel

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
