Song:

Big city close your eyes
Your pretty lights that shine like fireflies
Illuminate the starry sky
The gentle wind blows
Through it I send a hymn
A simple melody
To keep you close to me

Huh you hum (2x)

Sweet, sweet dreams
Sleep tight, good night

I*'m beating in your heart
A little drum
A little song
That's playing on repeat
Until we're in each other's arms again
But until then
I offer a lullaby
To cross the miles
And kiss you into sleep

Huh you hum (2x)

Sweet, sweet dreams
Sleep tight, good night

We'll be together when we close our eyes
We'll be together
We'll be together in our

Sweet, sweet dreams
Sleep tight, good night
Sweet, sweet dreams
Sleep tight, good night
