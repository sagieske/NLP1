[g] for years we both have lived on pride, [d7] dear
And we agree that love is [g] gone
Why, oh why do we keep [d7] tryin
A house without love is not a [g] home. [g7]

The [c] lovelight in your eyes has [g] faded
And Im contented just to [d7] roam
We [g] slaved to gain a worthless [d7] treasure
A house without love is not a [g] home.

No matter where our footsteps wander
I know well both be all alone
With the pride that came between us
A house without love is not a home.

The simple things have gone forever
We wanted wealth to call our own
And now weve reached the hour of parting
A house without love is not a home.
