Song:

Sitting here, all alone
Watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days
We threw them snow balls
I can't believe
I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you
And nobody else

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
Cuz I need you here
And I want for you to know

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You this christmas

And I never wanna do this alone
Baby I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays (yeah)
I just wanna if you feel the same way
Because I'm lonely baby
Want you to hold me baby

And I'm sorry
If I pushed you away
I just want you to know I miss you (miss you)
And I want you to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You this christmas

Wrapping gets without you babe
It's like mid december and there's no cold
I can't do this on my own
I've changed my ways
Keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay

And I don't care, if I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You
This christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I Want Is You this christmas
