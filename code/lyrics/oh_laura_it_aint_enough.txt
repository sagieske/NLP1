Song:

You come home in the evening with whiskey on your breath.
I dream about leaving, but I wake up with regrets.
The dinner that I made you is covered up in mold.
And you don't need to tell me that this is getting old.

It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you owe me.
It's just my luck to find someone like you.
It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you told me.
It ain't enough, it ain't enough.

Cutting to the chase now. I'll save us both some time.
Make it easier somehow to leave this all behind.
Now you said "Baby I'm not perfect, that's just the way it is."
Well anyone can see that, but I need more than this.

It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you owe me.
It's just my luck to find someone like you.
It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you told me.
It ain't enough, it ain't enough.

It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you owe me.
It's just my luck to find someone like you.
It ain't enough, it ain't half of what you told me.
It ain't enough, it ain't enough.

It ain't enough... 
It ain't enough...
