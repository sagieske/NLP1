Song:

Though I tried before to tell him
All the feelings I have for him in my heart
Every time that I come near him
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

Coz every little thing he does is magic
Everything he does just turns me on
Eventhough my love before is tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days
Since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me who ends up getting wet.

I resolve to call him up
A thousand times a day
And ask him if he'd marry me
In some old fashion way
But my silence fears to grip me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before my tounge has zip me
Must I always be alone

Coz every little thing he does is magic
Everything he does just turns me on
Eventhough my love before is tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days
Since we first met
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me who ends up getting wet.

Every little thing
Every little thigh he does
Every little thing he does is magic, magic, magic! [2x]
