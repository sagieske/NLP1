Song:

Yea, Ay, Ay, Ay, alright
Alright, Toomp, man
This what the f**k they been waitin' on, I guess (That's right)
Let's give it to 'em, baby (Ay, Grand Hustle, nigga)
Ay, man, they been waitin' on this s**t since what you know, huh? (Yeah, it's the king, b***h!)
Well, aight, my n***a
The wait is over n***a! (Hey, hey!)

One for the money, two for the show, dog
Three for the n****s hatin' on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words, I'ma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family before all
Without the braids, I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony, say it ain't so, homie!
Hey, shawty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got him right back on it (Oh)
Stepped back, brushed myself off
Picked business back up right where I left off
I can show my dope, that other guy just talk
Ay, where I live just as big as your projects, dog
Ay, ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, n***a let's just bet a
Hundred stacks on that, n***a I'm just better
Somebody better tell 'em, mane
They swag owe my swag everything
Very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I'd like to thank to thank you, cousin
Oh, and y'all oughta be havin' ya'll swag sendin' mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef?
What's the possibility? Stop, see, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated, don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say goodbye to the fame and the fortune, c'est la vie
What the game need wit' you, n***a? They got me
I ride through the city so clean, seat really low
Auto-mo-biel-lies so pretty, but I'm Illy, though
No comparison, ain't a n***a more thorough than
This gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn "Champagne," man
So deranged and belligerent, ranked up there with Benjamin
Who? Andre 3K, B. I. G., Jay-Z, ugk, Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and
Lupe, so f**k what you say
You welcome to ask who you may
Bet they say as of today
I'm back on top like a toupee
All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both high and sober too, I'm so high up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, n***a, who want proof?
Must agree that s**t I did, can't no one undo
I stay on my 1-2, n***a who want to
Turn a brunch into a brawl? Do what you gon' do
I'm why it's hot as a b***h in here
Still cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission, dear
Think that was somethin, ' listen here!
