(traditional)

Alberta, alberta,
Where you been so long?
Alberta, alberta,
Where you been so long?
Aint had no loving
Since youve been gone.

Alberta, alberta,
Whered you stay last night?
Alberta, alberta
Whered you stay last night?
Come home this morning,
Clothes don't fit you right

Alberta, alberta,
Girl, you're on my mind.
Alberta, alberta,
Girl, you're on my mind.
Aint had no loving
Such a great long time.

Alberta, alberta,
Where you been so long?
Alberta, alberta,
Where you been so long?
Aint had no loving
Since youve been gone.
