Bodie came from the hills
To see the world
Looking for different thrills
He found a girl
Showed him the city sights
Opened his eyes wide
No he finds
Bodie had changed his mind
Changed his mind
Came from the heart of town
She was no fool
Keeping him hanging around
She played it cool
Showed him the good life
And made herself his wife
Now he finds
Bodie had changed his mind
Changed his mind
I did not come
Just to lose my way
Things I've done there anyway
Bodie came from the hills
To see the world
Looking for different thrills
He found his girl
Showed him the good life
And made herself his wife
Now he finds
Bodie has changed his mind
Changed his mind
