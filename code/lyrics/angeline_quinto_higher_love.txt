Song:

I feel the rain has it falls
Shower me with higher love
I feel the rain has it falls
Shower me with higher love

I've been waiting for the one true love
Wishing, bringing to the heaven's above
I know, somewhere you raising at the stars
I'll see you rise at the moon shine's better me

And I feel the rain has it falls
We'll falling rain, rain, rain
Shower me with higher love
Love to the heaven's above
I'm like an angel, falling
Deeper into higher love

Oh... oh... oh...

I've been waiting for the love to come
I feel you closer getting into me now
Find me, take me, look me like the stars
Embrace the skies of these lifted me up above

I, it feels like heaven
Like you see your face in a ground
I, it feels like heaven
And it like a shooting star
I, it feels like heaven
And a love is coming down
I, it feels like heaven
One love and find a way

I feel the rain has it falls
We'll falling rain, rain, rain
Shower me with higher love
Love to the heaven's above
I'm like an angel, falling
Deeper into higher love

When I find you take me away

I feel the rain has it falls
We'll falling rain, rain, rain
Shower me with higher love
Love to the heaven's above
I'm like an angel, falling
Deeper into higher love

I feel the rain has it falls
We'll falling rain, rain, rain
Shower me with higher love
Love to the heaven's above
I'm like an angel, falling
Deeper into higher love
