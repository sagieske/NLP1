At the Dolphin the beer flowed like wine.
And people were drinking.
Over there, there were lives on the line,
But not at the Dolphin

Across the ocean the world was at war
And bullets were flying.
In the air there's plane headed for
The heart of the Dolphin.
It's after the Dolphin.

They were laughing and drinking and carrying on
And then in the blink of an eye they were gone, gone, gone.
So was the Dolphin, so was the Dolphin, gone was the Dolphin.

What will become of us all? Who know the story?
Will we witness the final fall of the hope and the glory?
Blinded by honor they fought eye to eye
Now men without faces rain fire from the sky.
When you kill from a distance is anyone to blame?
And the armies of warfare will never be the same again.
After the Dolphin, after the Dolphin, after the Dolphin.
