Song:

what's up today
can you hear me calling
it's time to play
every rock on my head
every leaf on me
is reminding trees
dreams really do come true*ya right*
c'mon let's go let's go and run around and round
what a beautiful feeling we've finally found
a peaceful valley
where everybody is having a good time now
kiimmie! kimmie! it's time to come home!
that's my mom, gotta go
see ya kp! hehe yep, bye!
c'mon lets go lets go and run around and round
what a beautiful feeling we've finally found
our peaceful valley
where everybody is having a good time now
ya!
