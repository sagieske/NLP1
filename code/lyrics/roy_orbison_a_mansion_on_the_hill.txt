Song:

Tonight down here in the valley
I'm lonesome and oh, how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin
I can see your mansion on the hill

Do you remember when we parted?
The story to me, you revealed
You said, you could live without love, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill

I've waited all through the years, love
To give you a heart, true and real
'Cos I know you are living in sorrow
In your loveless mansion on the hill

The light shines bright from your window
The trees stand so silent and still
I know you're alone with your pride, dear
In your loveless mansion on the hill
