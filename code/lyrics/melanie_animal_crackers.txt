Song:

Oh, eat your animal crackers
'Cause my mother told me so long ago,
"If you eat your animal crakers,
The children in Europe won't starve anymore".
Hahaha hahahaha hahaha.

Oh I love eating icecream,
Chocolate, vanilla and butter pecan,
But I best love animal crackers
'Cause I love helping my fellow man.
Yeah, I eat more crackers than anyone can
Hahaha haha.

Once I went on a diet
(that's the freudian part, is it, when I forget it)
Once I went on a diet
A carbohydrate diet ain't nice
'Cause you can't eat animal crackers.
So, I'm gonna stay a fatty for all of my life,
Hahaha hahaha.
But some people think that fatties are nice, yeah.

Did you ever hear of Alice's restaurant?
I eat at Alice's restaurant year after year.
She makes an animal cracker pizza, ha
And she gives animal crackers out free with the beer.
Oh, let's give Alice a great big cheer.
She knows the age...
Ah, animal crackers are in this year!
Ha ha hahaha.
Oh, lalalalala lala lala
