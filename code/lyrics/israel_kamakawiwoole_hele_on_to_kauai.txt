Song:

There's a place I recall
Not too big, in fact it's kinda small
The people there know they got it all
The simple life for me
Hele on to Kauai
Hanalei by the bay
Wailua river valley is where I used to play
The canyons of Waimea standing all aglow
The magic of the garden isle is calling me back home
When I was young, not too smart
I left my home, looking for a brand new start
To find a place that's better still
Now I know, I know I never will
Hele on to Kauai
Hanalei by the bay
Wailua river valley is where I used to play
The canyons of Waimea standing all aglow
The magic of the garden isle is calling me back home
Hele on to Kauai
Hanalei by the bay
Wailua river valley is where I used to play
The canyons of Waimea standing all aglow
The magic of the garden isle is calling me back home
It's calling me back home
