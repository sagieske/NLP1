Song:

Don't let no one get you down
By War
Ooooo... Ooooo... Ooooo...
Ooooo... Ooooo... Ooooo...
Don't let no one, noooo one get you down...
Cuz if they do, if they do
I'll be around...
I want you near, standing here by my side
So my dear wipe those tears from your eyes...
Ooooo... Ooooo... Ooooo
Ooooo... Ooooo... Ooooo
Don't let no one, noooo one get you down...
Cuz if they do, if they do
I'll be around...
I want to see, you round me
All the time
I want you to know that I am yours
And you are mines...
Let nobody get you down...(heeeeeey....)
Let nobody get you down...
Let nobody get you down...
Let nobody get you down...
Let nobody get you down...
Let nobody get you down... (you keep me happy all the time)
Let nobody get you down... (you keep me happy happy all the time)
Let nobody get you down... (you you you you you you you you)
