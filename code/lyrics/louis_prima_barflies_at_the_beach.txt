Song:

All right all you Swing Cats,
Lets try somethin' new
Drag your elbows off the Bar
and your can from the old bar stool
There's a place called the Ocean
Probably heard about it in school
They an't got no Martinez there
but man, its really cool

Guess what Barflie buddies
They got's women down there too
But that old rum struck Romeo
that dummy at got a clue
And just for viewin' pleasure
Head down by the pier
Think of all the dough you'll save
On whisky, Jin, and beer
Punk

Now the moral of this story
Is when life n' Jazz n' bar's
So club your ass down in the sand
and then look up at the stars
And if your feelin' homesick
Bring a show girl or two
toss them out a Volleyball
and Man, hey, enjoy the view

What's that, that's a shell
That's what your little sister is gonna come out of
When I date her
Ya see what I'm sayin punk

Oh those things swimming out there
Yea that's dolphins
Ya know, Flipper
That's what they make them Tuna Sandwich's out of
Makes them taste good
Sell them at the deli
You know what I'm talkin about
