Song:

You called me Lord
You know my name
I'm standing out
I'm not ashamed
No, no

I've searched and came up empty
This world has nothing for me
You are my one and only

I'm living my life for You
And I'm giving everything to You
Not holding back, from every part
I'm giving it all to You

You are the Lord of all I am
And, I'll never be the same again
I've searched and came up empty
This world has nothing for me
You are my one and only

I'm living my life for You
And I'm giving everything to You
Not holding back, from every part
I'm giving it all to You

I'm living my life for You
And I'm giving everything to You
Not holding back, from every part
I'm giving it all to You

I'm living my life for You
And I'm giving everything to You
Not holding back, from every part
I'm giving it all to You

I'm giving it all to You
Take all of me
I'm giving it all to You
Take all of me

I'm giving it all to You
Take all of me
I'm giving it all to You
Take all of me
