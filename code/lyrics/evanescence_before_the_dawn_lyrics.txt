Song:

Meet me after dark again and I'll hold you
I am nothing more than to see you there

[Chorus:]
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

If only night can hold you where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again

[Chorus:]
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

[Bridge:]
Somehow I know that we can't wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours

[Chorus:]
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

[Chanting]
