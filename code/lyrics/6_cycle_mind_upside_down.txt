Song:

I've been spending some time, thinking I'd be alright
Don't know if I could really make it tonight
Lie awake in the dark, come down then I start
Thinking about you is almost breaking my heart
I don't know where I went wrong, or what's going on
Baby, I feel like our love's lost tonight
Should I stay, should I go? Well, I really don't know
Lately I've been missing you so

[Refrain]
Baby, you don't understand our love lies lost
But you're still holding my hand
Oh and then you walk away
Just tonight, I want you to stay

[Chorus]
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down


Everytime I hurt you, well it's hurting me too
Don't know if I could really stay here tonight
Tired of thinking of you, I never think that you do
Tell me what am I supposed to do
Well, I just wanted to say that I need you today
Tell me it's all gonna work out alright
I don't know where I should I start
But with all of my heart
Baby let me be your lover tonight

[Refrain]
Baby, you don't understand our love lies lost
But you're still holding my hand
Oh and then you walk away
Just tonight, I want you to stay

[Chorus]
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down


Oh you know, you turn me upside down
You know, you turn me upside down

[Chorus]
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on, you turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
