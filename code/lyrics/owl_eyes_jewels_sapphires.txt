Song:

Open your eyes
Touch my hand
This is all I've wanted
This is my heaven
When you lay in clouds or sheets
I want to love you
I can't help but realise this is what I knew

And I...
I never wanted to run
And I...
There's something more than I get now
And I...
Tell you all the things I've been missing
Tell you all the truths
Tell you all the things I've been waiting for without you

Couldn't stay closed
Sun outside
All we feel is what we are, no reasons why

When you lay in clouds or sheets
I want to love you
I can't help but realise this is what I knew

And I...
I never wanted to run
And I...
There's something more than I get now
And I...
Tell you all the things I've been missing
Tell you all the truths
Tell you all the things I've been waiting for without you

There's something more than I get now
Get now (x30)

We dream we desire
Dream we desire
Give me this love

We dream we desire
Dream we desire
Jewels and Sapphires

I never wanted to run
And I...
There's something more than I get now
And I...
Tell you all the things I've been missing
Tell you all the truths
Tell you all the things I've been waiting for without you
