Song:

You don't even know me
But you hunt me the same
You don't even know me
But you hunt me the same
You don't even see me
But you seek me the same-

And you cheat the scales
When you push in
The stakes are fixed
So I can never win,

And if all fails you can pull on the line
It's a whales tail that I leave hehind
You don't take no heed but you want to get my
Still you pay no kind
Keep pulling in
Chain the tide
So that I can't swim
And if all else fails you can pull on the line

You don't even know me
But you own me the same
You don't even know me
But you own me the same
And when your net is empty
Its still me who you blame
When the deep blue sea
Grows dead and still
Take a bow
You had a hand in it.

And if all fails you can pull on the line
It's a whales tail that to leave hehind
You don't take no heed but you want to get my mind-
And if all else fails you can pull on the line.
