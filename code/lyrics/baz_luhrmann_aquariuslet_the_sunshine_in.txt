Song:

Let the sun shine,
let the sun shine in,
the sun shine in.

When the moon (moon, moon). Seventh house,
Jupiter, Jupiter. Mars.
Venus (Venus), Planets.
Love (love), Stars.

When the moon (when the moon), is in the seventh house (is in the seventh house).
And Jupiter, aligns with mars.
Then veeeeenus (Then veeeeenus ) will guide the planets (will guide the planets),
And love, will steal the stars,
Will steal the stars, will steal the stars, will steal the stars.

Let the sun shine,
Let the sun shine in,
The sun shine in.

(let the sun shine)

Let the sun shine,
Let the sun shine in,
The sun shine in.

When the moon (oh when the moon), is in the seventh house (is in the seventh house).
And Jupiter, aligns with mars (aligns with mars).
Then veeeeenus (oh then veeeeenus ) will guide the planets (oh guide the planets),
And love (oh an love, love, love, love),
Will steal the stars, (oh will steal the stars. Yeah!)

Let the sun shine,
Let the sun shine in,
The sun shine in.
(repeat 8 times)
