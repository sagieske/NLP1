Song:

If it hurts this much,
Then it must be love,
And it's a lottery,
I can't wait to draw your name.
Oh I'm trying to get to you,
But time isn't on my side,
If the truths the worst I could do,
Then I guess that I have lied.

Keeping me awake,
It's been like this now for days,
My heart is out at sea,
My head all over the place,
I'm losing sense of time,
And everything tastes the same,
I'll be home in a day,
I fear that's a month too late.

That night I slept,
On your side of the bed so,
It was ready when you got home,
We're like noughts and crosses in that
Opposites always attract.

You've taken me to the top,
And let me fall back south
You've had me at the top of the pile,
And then had me kissing the ground
We've heard and seen it all,
No ones talked us out,
The problems that have come
Haven't yet torn us down.

Am I keeping you awake, if I am then just say,
You can make your own decisions; you can make your own mistakes,
I'll live and let die all the promises you made,
But if you lie another time, it'll be a lie that's too late.

That night I slept,
On your side of the bed so,
It was ready when you got home,
We're like Noughts and crosses in that
Opposites always attract

You always have your way,
For now its to soon for you to say,
Will we be always always?
