Song:

Never needed anybody
Helpless, restless little soul
Always fighting against somebody
Living in denial all alone
But I know...

No one can live
Broken hearted
Not that I know of anyway
If only you could break this
Shell around me
'Till that I'm standing on my own
Living in denial all alone

No one of us can live forever
This life's like suicide with no gun
Heart full of love but soul is crying
Knowing this is what you've been hiding from
Soon you will know...

No one can live
Broken hearted
Not that I know of anyway
If only you could break this
Shell around me
'Till that I'm standing on my own
Living in denial all alone

The greatest thing you ever felt
Was when an enemy turned into a friend
You could not trust
New sunrise in a lonely heart
Sunrise always follows the dark
Now you know
I know you know

No one can live
Broken hearted
Not that I know of anyway
If only you could break this
Shell around me
'Till that I'm standing on my own
Living in denial all alone
