Song:

Straight as an arrow
Defect, defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject, reject
Twards anti-social
Dull dull, so dull
Standing on the stairs
Cold cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
May day may day
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them
Dimension 7 Past astro borders
Zeno lies waiting
Past gascous remains
Intrigue such intrigue
Gonna leave this region
There taking me with them
