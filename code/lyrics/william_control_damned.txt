Song:

Dance dance dance in the graveyard
Slow down pretend to save your
Loneliness is free
You're lonely cause of me
Peel back layers of hatred
Black eyes swollen and sacred
Dark skies fallen then taken
All because of me

I sing for the damned
The soulless hand in hand
When god has f****d a queen
What a sight what smell
What a f*****g scene

Dance dance dance in the moonlight
Kill joy pleasure for all time
His art shooting the sunshine
All because of me
If I find you alone and afraid
The threat of losing the life that you've made
It's grey always
All because of me
