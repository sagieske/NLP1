Song:

This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm gonna wake up
Someones gonna bring me round

Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields

Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

And this is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me round

This is a warning
4 minute warning
