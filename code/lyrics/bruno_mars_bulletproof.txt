Song:

Oooh oooh oh oh oooh 2x
Oh oh

You've been hurt before
Girl I know you
Your heart's been through the storm and more
I can tell you barely survived
But girl my love won't be the same
I'm not trying to run no game
Just want your tears to dry
Girl why do I have to pay for your past
I don't
Do you want to come at last
