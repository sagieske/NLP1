Song:

I can't give
When you give nothing in return
I can't live
When all my freedom's burned
Above me
In front of me no room for you
Beside me
Is all that I can do

Don't hold me
Don't tie me down
Don't change me
Leave what you've found
All alone

So quiet
Your insecurities are clear
You hide it
There's so much that you fear
Run naked
There's beauty in an open soul
Just break it
Your desire to control

Don't hold me
Don't tie me down
Don't change me
Leave what you've found
You won't break me
I won't turn around
You can't take me
And leave what you found
All alone

All alone
Don't try your ideals at me
All alone baby I'm not something that you can own
All alone I won't live in your world for me
All alone Look at me I'm better of
All alone on the run from reality
All alone the light's on but baby I won't be home
All alone your attitude is all pride to me
All alone keep it up and you're gonna be
All alone
