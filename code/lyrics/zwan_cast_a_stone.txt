Song:

Who says i cannot be betrayed
Let them stand and laugh
Who says i shouldn't be ashamed
Let them know my past
Who says i cannot be believed
Let them walk my trail
Who says i shouldn't be released
From the last abuse
It's just, just us
And us and rain
Spare thoughts and change
Should you feel the need to throw
The first stone through my window
Feel free to let it go
I'm home
Who says i cannot be betrayed
Let them stand and laugh
Who says i shouldn't be ashamed
Let them know my past
Who says i cannot be believed
Let them walk my trail
Who says i shouldn't be released
From the last abuse
It's just, just us
And us and rain
Spare thoughts and change
Should you feel the need to throw
The first stone through my window
Feel free to let it go
I'm home
Should you ever need to cry
And if you're barely getting high
You should know that i won't let you die
Who says i shouldn't feel ashamed
Who says i shouldn't feel ashamed
And should you feel the need to throw
The first stone through my window
Let it go
And should you ever need to cry
And if you're barely getting high
You should know that i won't let you die
You should never feel alone
You should never feel alone
When i'm around
You should never feel alone
You should never feel alone
You should never feel alone
When i'm around
