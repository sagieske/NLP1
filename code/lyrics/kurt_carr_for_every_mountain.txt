Song:

I've got so much to thank God for
So many wonderful blessings
And so many open doors
A brand new mercy
Along with each new day
That's why I praise You
And for this I give You praise

For waking me up this morning
That's why I praise You
For sending me on my way
That's why I praise You
For letting me see the sunshine
Of a brand new day
A brand new mercy
Along with each new day
That's why I praise You and for this
I give You praise

You're Jehovah Jhireh
That's why I praise You
You've been my Provider
That's why I praise You
So many times You've met my need
So many times You rescued me
That's why I praise You
I want to thank You for the blessing
You give to me each day
That's why I praise You
For this I give You praise

For every mountain You brought me over
For every trial you've seen me through
For every blessing
Hallelujah, for this I give You praise
