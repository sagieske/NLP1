Song:

It feels like whisky and butterfly's
Like midnight kisses in the morning light
Waking up with you, here by my side
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless

I'm tasting sandalwood on your skin, when it ends I only wanna start again
I see your name and it's a violin
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless

Tonight, tonight, tonight you are my music
Move my heart like a metronome
Tonight, tonight I wanna lose it
I'd be the only song, you'll ever know
(oh, oh) Play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven
(Oh, oh) play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven

It's like were caught up in a endless dream
The clocks don't tick when you hold on to me We're keeping the rhythm so perfectly
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless

Tonight, tonight, tonight you are my music
Hold my heart like a metronome
Tonight, tonight I wanna lose it
I'd be the only song, you'll ever know
(oh, oh) Play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven
(Oh, oh) play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven

(Eh, Uh, Oh, Oh, He, He, Yeah Yeah)

Cause Tonight, tonight, tonight you are my music
Hold my heart like a
Tonight, tonight I wanna lose it
I'd be the only song, you'll ever know
(oh, oh) Play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven
(Oh, oh) play you like a instrument, let me be your beethoven
