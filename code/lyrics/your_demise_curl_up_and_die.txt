Song:

After all I'd done for you
No matter how hard I tried
It wouldn't matter to me much right now
If you curled up and died
It's nearly a year on, and I'd wiped you from my mind
I'm so f*****g glad I turned you down, than kept you by my side

Still don't know what you put me through
Cos you're a f*****g callous b***h
Is it you're thick or just innocent?
Well your purity makes me itch

I know it was bullshit when you were f*****g around behind my back
Always leaving me in the lurch and you thought I'd have you back?
You think you're doing fine, well not last time I checked
You're leaving your friends behind, and looks like your life is next
You know it's bullshit, what you're about
I've no respect for your way of life
Cos you're a down and out
