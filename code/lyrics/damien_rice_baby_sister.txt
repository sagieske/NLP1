Song:

Don't wake up, baby sister
Keep dreaming
Did he fill your cup?
Baby sister, keep drinking

Or he'll hit you
He'll bleach your eyes
So be a good girl just for the night
And run! Run!

Don't get stuck,
Baby sister, leave this land
And read your books
Baby sister, wash your hands

Or he'll hit you
He'll bleach your eyes
So be a good girl just for the night
And run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run, baby sister, run!
Baby sister.
