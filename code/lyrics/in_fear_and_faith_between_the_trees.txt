Song:

Sounds of life bring in the new day.
Light shines upon those who rest.
Are there reasons worth waking for?
Is my time worth waiting for?

Whispers blow through the trees.
A thoughtful calm, bring peace.
The light now drifts away, 
Dark ascends in silence.
With no direction this day never ends.

A constant struggle to make sense.
Forever it seems but an instant struggle to make sense.
A fraction of time (Whispering)
A brush stroke in the picture (Whispering)
The light now drifts away.
Light shines upon those who rest.
