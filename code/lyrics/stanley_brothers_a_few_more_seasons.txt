Song:

Mother first was called to heaven
Left our home all alone
Dad took sick soon and joined her
They're reunited on god's throne

A few more tiring days still face us
A few more weary nights shall come
We'll all be on our way to heaven
When a few more seasons come

In springtime when the flowers blossom
Spreading their fragrance through the air
Walking through the little churchyard
Soon we'll all be resting there
