Song:

Come out, come out, wherever you are and meet the young lady,
Who fell from a star.
She fell from the sky, she fell very far and Kansas, she says,
Is the name of the star.
Kansas, she says, is the name of the star.
She brings you good news. Or haven't you heard?
When she fell out of Kansas
A miracle occurred.
It really was no miracle. What happened was just this.
The wind began to switch - the house to pitch and suddenly
The hinges started to unhitch.
Just then the Witch - to satisfy an itch went flying
On her broomstick, thumbing for a hitch.
And oh, what happened then was rich.
*The house began to pitch. The kitchen took a slitch.
It landed on the Wicked Witch
In the middle of a ditch,
Which was not a healthy situation for the Wicked Witch.
(* = repeated)
... Who began to twitch and was reduced to just a stitch
Of what was once the Wicked Witch.
