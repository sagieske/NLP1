Song:

Don't you feel so lonely when it's in the afternoon
and you gotta face it
all through the night
Don't it make you believe
that something's gonna have to happen soon
oh baby, all through the night

All through the night
oh baby, all through the night
All through the night
all through the night

Have you ever played with an all night band
and gone trough it, baby
all through the night
When the daytime descends in a night time of hell
everybody's gone to look for a bell to ring
all through the night
And they do it, all through the night
babe, all through the night
When the words were donw and the poetry comes
and the novel's written and the book is done
you said, oh Lord, lover, baby, give it to me
all through the night
And she says it

My best friend Sally, she got sick
and I'm feeling mighty I'll myself it happens all the time
and all through the night
I went to Saint Vincent's and I'm watching the ceiling
fall down on her body as she's lying round on the ground
said, oh babe, gotta celebrate all through the night
Feel so sad I cried all through the night
I said, oh Jesus, all through the night
If the sinners sin and the good man's gone
and a woman can't come and help him home
and what you're gonna do about it
when they go on all through the night
and they sing, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
all through the night
and he says, give it to me all through the night
It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry
give a little loving and some peace of mind
I said, hey babe, give it to me all through the night

And some people wait for things that never come
and some people dream of things they've never been done
they do it, oh baby, all through the night
The city's funny and the country's quiet
but I'd wanna know why they don't have a riot
why don't they do it, baby, all through the night
Ooohhh mama, ooohhh mama, tell me 'bout it
all through the night
I want to have it all through the night
If Christmas comes only once a year
why can't anybody she'd just one tear
for things that don't happen all through the night
Ooohhh mama, all through the night
oh baby, do it to me all through the night
Easy, easy, baby, why don't you give it to -
- me all through the night
