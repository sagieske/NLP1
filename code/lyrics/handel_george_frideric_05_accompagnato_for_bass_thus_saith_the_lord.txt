Song:

Thus saith the Lord, the Lord of Hosts: Yet once a little while and I will
Shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land. And I will
Shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come. (Haggai
2: 6-7)
The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the
Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, He shall come,
Saith the Lord of Hosts. (Malachi 3: 2)
