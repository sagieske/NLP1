Song:

When I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya,
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh...

I had a father who came from nothing
He took that and he made it something
He'd seen it all by his 21st, right
His mum and dad both left this earth, why
It was the drinking that killed his mother
He's watching the same thing kill his brother
And he doesn't say it much but he really loves us
And he doesn't want the same thing to kill his sons
When he sees me with a drink in my hand
I understand now why he thinks that it's bad
Cause he knows that it's so evil
But he knows we're our own people, so he let's us go

When I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...

See, I don't know if God's real
But if he is I can image how God feels
And there's things I'd discuss with him
I bet he wouldn't change much
But there's s**t he would have done different
When my grandpa passed away
I remember saying bye on his last few days
And I'm hoping there's a heaven
I want to meet again
And I never met anybody as positive as him
Not many were as sick as him

But he didn't let the illness kill his grin
And that's why I went ahead and inked my skin
Cause I remember the smile when I think of him

When I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...

I didn't know that my brother got bullied in school
If I could go back now, I wouldn't be fooled
He probably thought mum and dad don't f*****g care
But it wasn't even that, they were so unaware
Living in a family where money is favored
Makes us wanna say, I fu***n' hate it
Brother though we gotta feel blessed as f**k
Just remember they only want the best for us
We got a mum that's an angel, I'm thankful
To even have her in my life, I'm grateful
Family is anybody that close to you
See this song right here, it is overdue
For you...

When I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
Now I know, now I know, now I know oh oh ohh...
I was just a child, I didn't know much about ya, ooh... Ooh...
