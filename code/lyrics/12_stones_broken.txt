Song:

Bleeeaaargh!

Alone again, again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that you will call me home
The pain inside, my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in you

Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

I question why you chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall
And all in all faith is blind
But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take your life

Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from you again
All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothing's gonna change
Until I'm broken

This time, right now!

Cause I'm broken
I know I need you now
Cause deep inside I'm broken
You see the way I live
I know, I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away

Broken
Broken
Broken
Broken
Waaauuuugh!
