Song:

That's the bell, and I'm gonna be late
Like I really give a shit
Don't expect me to relate when you're
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Thirteen
?? going to so good
Gonna take them there too
No one else can understand when you're
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Thirteen
The school shrink says I gotta calm down
And learn to look the other way
He says I'm lost, but I'm gonna be found, he said
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Holier than a cow
Thirteen
That's the bell, I'm gonna be late
Remember when I was a baby
And I was happy just to breathe, I was
Holier than thou
Holier than thou
Holier than a cow
Thirteen
