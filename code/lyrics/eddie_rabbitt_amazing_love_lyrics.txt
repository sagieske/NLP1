Song:

I knock on your door, it opens, and there you are
The light of my life shining like a star
You smile and tell me with your eyes
That I belong here

I leave all the pain of the world outside
Fall in your arms and it feels so fine
With you holding on to me
Well, girl, I'm strong here

And nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love
I want you to know
That every night I thank all the stars above
My guiding light, your amazing love
Where would I be now if I hadn't found you?
Amazing love

I look in your eyes and I see a happy man
In love with a girl who understands
My heart you hold it in your hand
And girl, I need you

I wouldn't know what to do
I wouldn't know where to go without you

And nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love
I want you to know
That every night I thank all the stars above
My guiding light, your amazing love
Where would I be now if I hadn't found you?
Amazing love

Nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love
Where would I be now if I hadn't found you?
Amazing love

And nothing feels like your amazing love
It always heals, your amazing love
I want you to know
That every night I thank all the stars above
My guiding light, your amazing love
Where would I be now?
