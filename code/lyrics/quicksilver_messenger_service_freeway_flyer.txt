Song:

I'm a freeway flyer and I'm down on the floor,
I keep on gettin' high, wonderin' how high can one man go?
Well, I'm a dangerous stranger, I'm a psychedelic ranger,
Now there's no place that I can't go, no no no, baby, no no no.
I'm a freeway wrestler, I keep it to the floor,
I'm an old poor guitar hassler, and I can always get my way back home anywhere,
Well, I'm a six-string rangler, I'm a traffic strangler,
And now there's no place that I can't go, no no no, babe, no no no.
I'm a little girl pleaser, I always get my way,
I'm an old sweet thing teaser, I'm gonna die and go to Hell some day,
Well, I'm a meat grinder, sweet spot foot ___ roll in the ___ cash.
