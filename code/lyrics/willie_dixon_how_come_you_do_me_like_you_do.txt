Song:

How come you do me like you do, do, do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you

Do me right or else just let me be
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me
How come you do me like you do, do, do?
How come you do me like you do?
