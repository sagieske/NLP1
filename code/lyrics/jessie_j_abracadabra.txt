Song:

I don't wanna be the reason, we don't get down
So imma let you do the leading, and follow you now
See I just don't usually do this, but you bringing me out

All the doubts I had have gone away,
When your touching me I'm not afraid
Knowing the same, going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl (your girl)
Tell me, woo yeahh

I can be, all you want, what'doyah say
I just wanna be your girl, yeahhh

Cause you got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

Ya got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

I didn't even see ya coming, it was such a suprise
I wasn't expecting nothing, now I'm lit up inside
You're bringing out all the colors, no more black and white

You won the race and got the gold, so here I am we're good to go
Knowing the same, going away, here to stay
I just wanna be your girl (your girl)
Common tell me, that...

I can be, all you want, what'dya say?
I just wanna be your girl
Woahohohohohh, yeah

Cause you got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

Ya got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

Woahhh...
I don't wanna take my time, I don't wanna wait in line
I just want you by my side, common give me what I like

I don't wanna take my time, I don't wanna wait in line, nooo
I just want you by my side, common give me what I like

Cause you got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra

Ya got my heart on lock, it's so unreal you know
Don't want this to stop, your so damn keepable
Feel your magic touch, it's unbelievable
I gotta have ya, like abracadabra
