New Boyz
Don't say a word, just turn around and let me see
Girl you got something special, something special for me,
It's way too many suckas in the vip,
Girl I got my car, I want, t-tell me, do you want to kick it in the back seat,

Chorus:
I want to keep beside you, in the back seat
So I can be a back seat driver, back seat,
I want to keep beside you, in the back seat
So I can be a back seat driver.

You see them girls with them high heels they got this party poppin'
This ain't no country club we 'bout to get this party rockin'
You a got girl that's with the beanies get on top let me see you go,
You're... Here we outta here, you jump in my vehicle
... She just try to fit confortly... Right up in... ,
I'm damn girl, damn girl, you're f*cking with the man girl,
Damn girl, damn girl, you're f*cking with the men girl,

Bridge:
Don't say a word, just turn around and let me see,
Girl you got something special, something special for me,
It's way too many suckas in the vip,
Girl I got my car, I want, tell me, do you want to kick it in the back seat,

Chorus:
I want to keep inside you, in the back seat
I can be a back seat driver, in the back seat,
I want to keep inside you, end up in the back seat
I can be a back seat driver.

Yeah, hey girl, what's up, the ladies dancing get you up, girl,
I notice you're been catching your friends is freaky starstruck,
You got more of that you say you're shy swag
Until you get it low quit playin' with your fine a**
I say don't try me baby, I'll make you hot trick,
Missing like fish... Dancing...
Oh you are a good girl, it's cool, I play pretend to
I heard you had a baby, you want a new boy in you?

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]

I've met a group of girls in the escalate, I met a group of girls in the escalate
M-m-m-met a group of girls in the escalate, they came with you and left with me
I met a group of girls in the escalate, I met a group of girls in the escalate,
M-m-m-met a group of girls in the escalate, they came with you and left with me me me me me me

[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
