Song:

She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
Shes always worried about things like that
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining
(chorus)
She says baby
Its 3am I must be lonely
When she says baby
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
Says the rains gonna wash away I believe it

Shes got a little bit of something, God it's better than nothing
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
She swears the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to
And she only sleep when it's raining
And she screams and her is straining
(chorus)
She believes that life is made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
But outside it's stopped raining
(chorus)
