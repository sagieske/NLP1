Song:

Deep in the night,
Coming the violence
Sweet with the danger

Our laws colide
Not allowing
Another contender

When the wine
Drinks itself
You'll burn to a cinder

We're fighting time
Awaiting the answers

I'll never let them stake you down
(Take you down)
I'll fight to find a way

Is there a way
To turn the mind
Of a barbaric stranger

Eternal days
Awaiting for you to
Awake my avenger

A primal faith
Now condemms us
To burn to a cinder

Are we to late
Boarding on empty

I'll never let them stake you down
(Take you down)
I'll fight to find a
Way up there it must be hard
I'll never let them break you now
(Forsake you now)
Keep holding on and

[Chorus:]
Give me answers to my prayers
We'll never we'll face the glare
You're the light I see to
Raise the flame and blaze the fire,
Give me answers to my prays
We'll carry all the weight to bear
Give me sight to see and
Now I'm gone, you'll stay to keep the flame

I'll never let them stake you down,
I'll fight to find a
Way up there it must be hard
I never let them break you now,
Keep holding on and

[Chorus:]

Why can't I bleed with you?
Forever I will be thrown to the wolves
Living on all our dreams
