Song:

My life is a weathered down shipwreck
Splitting at the seams, held together by memories and 
Dreams
Every face I have seen, a stitch on my mind
On a shadow of a dream

And my heart is it's cargo, a worn out old thing
Been dragged around this rock more times than you’d 
Believe
To the east I call home
But to the west, she is calling
From the north, to the south
Forever I’m drifting away
With more hope than fear
Put your head to my chest and you will hear

The sound of it beating
Is the sound of love leaving
The sound of it beating
Is the sound of the emptiness flooding in

Flooding in
It’s the sound of the emptiness flooding in

And my life, it aches
And my heart, it breaks
And I just can’t shake the feeling all I am is sinking
While one thousand eyes stare back at me
But the ones that I’d die for are the ones I can’t see

Flooding in

It’s the sound of the emptiness
