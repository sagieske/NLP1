Song:

From one generation to another
We declare the famous name Jesus
Celebrate His resurrection power
Gave His life so we can live in freedom

In every nation He is alive
In every language it's the same hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive

Alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive

From one generation to another
We declare the famous name Jesus
Celebrate His resurrection power
Gave His life so we can live in freedom

In every nation He is alive
In every language it's the same hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive

Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Jesus is alive

Alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive all over the world
Alive, alive, alive

He conquered death so I can live
He paid my debts now I'm free
He conquered death so I can live
He paid my debts now I'm free

He conquered death so I can live
He paid my debts and now I'm free

In every nation He is alive
In every language it's the same hallelujah

Blessed be our risen Savior
Jesus is alive, alive, alive all over the world
