Song:

Orphans

It's the hard-knock life for us!
It's the hard-knock life for us!

Annie

'Steada treated,

Orphans

We get tricked!

Annie

'Steada kisses,

Orphans

We get kicked!

All

It's the hard-knock life!
Go' no folks to speak of, so,
It's the hard-knock row we hoe!

Annie

Cotton blankets,

Orphans

'Steada of wool!

Annie

Empty Bellies,

Orphans
'Steada of full!

All

It's the hard-knock life!

Annie

Don't if feel like the wind is always howlin?

Kate and tessie

Don't it seem like there's never any light!

Duffy and july

Once a day, don't you wanna throw the towel in?

Molly and pepper

It's easier than puttin' up a fight.

Annie

No one's there when your dreams at night get creepy!
No one cares if you grow... Of if you shrink!
No one dries when your eyes get wet an' weepy!

All

From all the cryin' you would think this place's a sink!
Ohhhh!
Empty belly life!
Rotten smelly life!
Full of sorrow life!
No tomorrow life!

Molly

Santa Claus we never see

Annie

Santa Claus, what's that?
Who's he?

All

No one cares for you a smidge
When you're in an orphanage!

Molly

(Making a whistling sound and imitating Miss. Hannigan)
You'll stay up till this dump shines like the top of the Chrysler Building.

Orphans

Yank the whiskers from her chin

Molly

You pig dropings

Orphans

Jab her with a safety Pin

Molly

Rotten orphans

Orphans

Make her drink a mickey finn

Molly

Nobdy love's you

I love you, Miss Hannigan

Molly

(Whistle)
Get to work!
(Whistle)
Strip them beds!
(Whistle)
I said get to work!

All
It's the hard-knock life for us
It's the hard-knock life for us
No one cares for you a smidge
When your in an orphanage
It's the hard-knock life
It's the hard-knock life
It's the hard-knock life!
