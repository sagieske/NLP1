Song:

[Verse:]
She'll let it slide
All the things that I
Have running through my mind
Will all be gone in time
Remember son
All the things you've done
And all the things you've lost
And all the things you've won

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're just trying to find some color in this
Black and white world

[Chorus:]
Tell me everything (will be alright)
Walk this way with me (into the light)
If you can let it slide
Baby just for the night
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes

[Verse 2:]
Should have taken time
Things will be just fine
To bite the hand that feeds
'Cause nothing's ever mine
And just wait your turn
And always try to learn
To love the ones that don't show love in return

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're just trying to find some color in this
Black and white world

[Chorus:]
Tell me everything (will be alright)
Walk this way with me (into the light)
If you can let it slide
Baby just for the night
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes

[Bridge:]
When you're walking backwards
Don't be afraid to close your eyes
'Cause the truth is, darling
That everything will be alright (alright)

[Chorus:]
Tell me everything (tell me anything)
Walk this way with me (just tell me everything)
If you can let it slide
Baby just for the night
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes

[Chorus:]
Tell me everything (will be alright)
Walk this way with me (into the light)
If you can let it slide
Baby just for the night
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes

Oh yeah, everyone feel cheated sometimes
Yeah, we all feel f****d up sometimes
