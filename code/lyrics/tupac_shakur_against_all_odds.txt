Song:

One love, one love, one thug
One nation, twenty-one gun salute

I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest s**t I ever spoke

Twenty-one gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little n***a named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout he left the hospital took five like me
You living fantasies, n***a I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk a**, now we out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why n***a blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, n***a close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war s**t deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these b***h n****s beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that s**t you said to Vibe about me bein a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you b***h n****s from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
N****s lookin like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryin to player hate on my s**t, you eat a fat d**k
Let it be known this is how you made me
Lovin how I got you n****s crazy

Against all odds
Hopin my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest s**t I ever spoke, against all odds
Hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote

I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewelery, fast cars and he's known for flashing (What's his name???)
Listen while I take you back (n***a say his name!) and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin for the feds, same crime, different trials
N***a, picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you b***h n****s is listenin, The World Is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, n****s stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game n***a
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a b***h n***a, "WHY YOU LIE?!?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots too Tutt, now you stuck
F**k the rap game, n***a this M-O-B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds

I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest s**t I ever spoke
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote
Against all odds

Puffy gettin robbed like a b***h, to hide the fact
He did some s**t he shouldn't have did, so we ride em for that
And that n***a that was down for me, restin dead
Switch sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the s**t that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin the dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly, It Was Written
(ey yo Nas) Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life, so what's the answer Nas?
N****s that don't rhyme right, you've seen too many movies
Load em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, goodbye
Let the real live n****s hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me n***a

Against all odds
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest s**t I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest s**t I ever spoke
[repeat]

Against all odds
[Twenty-one gun salute]
One love to my true thug n****s (Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
Twenty-one gun salute to my n****s that die in the line of duty
Representin to the fullest bein soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, twenty-one gun salute
I salute you my n****s, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you b***h made n****s, I'm comin for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the f**k you is, n***a
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers think that I forgot
Hell no I ain't forgot n***a
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money behind me
Aight, I got my money right here, now I want war
