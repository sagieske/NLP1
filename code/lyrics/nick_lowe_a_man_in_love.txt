Song:

Like a man in love I’m walkin’ around
Tryin’ to figure out why you put me down
I've traveled over mountains, valleys too
Tryin’ to find a way to get to you

Everyone says you’re just a flirt
But I know you love to see me hurt
There’s no more glow in the moon above
To shine down on a man in love

Well, if you get lonesome and your blue
Call me up and I’ll come to you
I won’t come runnin’, I’ll be flyin’
I’ll be laughin’ and I won’t be cryin’

Everyone says you’re just a flirt
But I know you love to see me hurt
There’s not enough glow in the moon above
To shine down on a man in love

Everyone says you’re just a flirt
But I know you love to see me hurt
There’s not enough glow in the moon above
To shine down on a man in love

To shine down on a man in love
To shine down on a man in love
I said there's no more glow
To shine down on a man in love
