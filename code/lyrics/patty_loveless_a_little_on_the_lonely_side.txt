Song:

You ask me how I'm doin' since you left
I can't lie, sometimes I'm beside myself
And the way I feel is to hard to hide
A little on the lonely side

Do you really want to know
What I've been through
Let me just say I'm still wrapped up in you
And the broken heart keeps me alive
A little on the lonely side

I'm a little on the lonely side
Where only the strong survive
And I'm barely gettin' by
A little on the lonely side

Some days I spend all my nights on memories
Goin' through what's left of what used to be
And the nights get longer all the time
A little on the lonely side

I'm a little on the lonely side
Where only the strong survive
And I'm barely gettin' by
A little on the lonely side

I'm a little on the lonely side
Where only the strong survive
And I'm barely gettin' by
A little on the lonely side
