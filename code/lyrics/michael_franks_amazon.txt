Song:

Inside my dream
I hear the jungle parrots scream
Just me and you
Alone in our dugout canoe
We kiss
The snakes hiss
We drift on
Amazon
Each day we fight
To stay alive
Make love each night
Drunk with desire
Asleep beside the jungle fire
We are
Like jaguar
And python
Amazon
In the morning we eat roast banana
In the evening we drink mat tea
And the waterfall water's sweet
In the green equatorial heat
Like the river we journey to the sea
Like the river we journey
Like the river we journey to the
Like the river we journey to the sea
