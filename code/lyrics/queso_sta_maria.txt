Song:

Dwelling in your own cell
A prisoner of your own
We are all but perfect
Be conscious in improving
Life is more difficult with you
But what can I do?
Lets just be thankful what life has to offer
I can tell what's in your mind
Better speak

Before you cry and whine about things
Make sure your not making a fool out of yourself

Can you handle the truth?
We can't stay like this
You almost had me there
Santa maria
I'm just taking what is rightfully mine
I'm just wondering,
How come you became so selfish?
I can't tell what's in your mind
So better speak
Before you cry and whine about things
Make sure your not making a fool out of yourself

Can you handle the truth?
We can't stay like this
You almost had me there
