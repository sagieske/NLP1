Song:

I'm feeling sexy and free
Like glitters raining on me
Your like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm bout to explode 
I can taste the tention like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause your taking me there 
Don't you know you spin me out of control

We can do this all night
Damn this love is skin tight 
Pull me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up the rhythm
Baby, come on! 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losing my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathing like I'm running cause your taking me there
Don't you know you spin me out of control
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

We can do this all night
Damn this love is skin tight 
Baby come on
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Pull me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up the rhythm
Baby, come on! 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Ooh ooh ooh 
Rock my world into the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
