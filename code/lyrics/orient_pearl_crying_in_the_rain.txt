Song:

You tell me I'm sorry
That's all you can say
You left with no reason
Inspite of the pain
Now I know I've lost you
Forever

The hurt of rejection is hurting inside
And now that I'm broken
I've got nothing to hide
And now I'm just waiting
For the sun to shine

[Chorus:]
Oooohhhh
(As/cause) I cry in the rain
(And you're the reason)
Then I cry in the rain
(And it's your fault)
I stand but I fall
Can't get up so I crawl
Cause I cry in the rain

You took me for granted for all that I am
Made me feel like I'm nothing
How much more can I stand
And now I'm still waiting
For the sun to shine

(Repeat chorus 3x)

Yeah
Yes I cry in the rain
Oh as I cry in the rain
Yes I cry in the rain
Don't love me don't love me
Cry ahahaha
You tell me I'm sorry
That's all you can say
