Song:

I'll believe you when I see you cry
No one needs to tell me reasons why
And I'm scared of losing, losing all we have

When there's all eyes on you
All eyes on you
Let it be my eyes on you

Stop this feeling
Make it go away
I had to change things
Soon as yesterday
As I watch you fading, fading out on me

Now there's all eyes on you
All eyes on you
All eyes on you
All eyes on you
Let it be my eyes on you

If I tell you I'll be there
Won't you give me one more chance to change
If you listen to what I say
I know you are the only one for me

I'll believe you when I see you cry
No one needs to tell me reasons why

When there's all eyes on you

All eyes on you
All eyes on you
All eyes on you
Let it be my eyes on you
(Repeats)
