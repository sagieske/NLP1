Ariana Grande:
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Mac Miller:
Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off of a flower like
Do she love me, do she love me not?
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot

Ariana Grande:
You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at 100
Never get it off, I can't stay away

Pre-chorus:
If you want I got it, I got it everyday
You can go on playing it for me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper

Chorus:
So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel when you're next to me
I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

Verse 2:
Oh, so crazy you get my heart jumping, 
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it's ain't a question, (question)
Boy I know just what you like

Pre-chorus:
So If you need I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
Say, I ain't going nowhere cause you're a keeper

Chorus:
So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel when you're next to me
I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

Mac Miller:
Uh, I make it feel so fine, I make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely, 
So you're sleeping in mine
You come and watch a movie with me, 
"American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that groovy, 
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you, 
I'm not gon' get bored of
But baby you're an adventurous so please let me come and explore you

Chorus:
So don't you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care this is it babe
I don't want another way to feel when you're next to me
I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love the way)
I love the way
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you uh, uh uh yeah
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it
The way I love you
