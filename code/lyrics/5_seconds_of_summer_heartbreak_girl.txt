Song:

[Calum:]

You call me up
It's like a broken record, 
You say that your heart hurts
That you'll never get over him getting over you, 

And you end up crying
And I end up lying, 
'Cause I'm just a sucker for anything that you do

[Luke:]

And when the phone call finally ends, 
You say thanks for being a friend
And we're going in circles again and again

[Chorus:]

I dedicate this song to you, 
The one who never sees the truth
That I could take away your hurt, 
Heartbreak Girl
Hold you tight, straight through the daylight, 
I'm right here, when you gonna realise?
That I'm your cure, 
Heartbreak girl

[Calum:]

I bite my tongue, 
But I want to scream out
You could be with me now, 
But I end up telling you what you want to hear

But you're not ready, 
And it's so frustrating
He treats you so bad and I'm so good to you, it's not fair

[Luke:]

And when the phone call finally ends, 
You say I'll call you tomorrow at 10
And I'm stuck in the friendzone again and again

[Chorus]

[Calum:]

I know someday it's gonna happen, 
And you'll finally forget the day you met him
Sometimes I'm so close to your confession, 
I've gotta get it through your head, 
That you belong with me instead

[Chorus X2]
