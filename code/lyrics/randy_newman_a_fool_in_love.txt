Song:

Look at the light coming over me
Show me a man whos gentle and kind
And i'll show you a loser
Now, show me a man who takes what he wants
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
Ohhhhhhhhh how exciting
So the poet sings

When you're a fool in love
And nothing goes the way you plan
And no one cares and no one understands
That you're a fool and you're in love
Never another spring for you,
Never a robin to sing for you,
You're out there on your own
When you're a fool in love

When you're a fool in love
Seems like the skies are always grey
You turn around there's someone in your way
And it's you, and you're in love
Sometimes you think that your luck has changed
And a rainbow explodes 'cross the sky,
But when you're a fool in love
You'll be a fool 'til the day you die
