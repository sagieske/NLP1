Song:

Send me on home boys the cattle retire
Wind up the mountain is blowin' in my ears
Been 7 weeks now I home once again
Warm meal some whiskey let the wild games begin

Seven card stud is the deal I require
With outlaws and beggars and lawmens and liars
Whiskey will flow until the damn runs dry
Make 'em grow crazy with that fire in their eyes

[Chorus:]
My fortune was made but I've lost it twice
My timing was off every time I tried
When all circumstances have worn me thin
I take my last chance and I'm home again
If the timing were right I'd stay with you tonight...

The ladies are dancing and spinnin' round

Smoke rings and big dreams will lay you right down
Soon I'll be leaving this magic behind
To the dust of my cattle with too much sunshine

Send me on home boys the cattle retire
Wind up the mountain is blowin' in my ears
Been 7 weeks now I home once again
Warm meal some whiskey let the wild games begin

[Chorus:]
