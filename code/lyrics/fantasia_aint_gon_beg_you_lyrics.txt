Song:

I mean I'm not gon' beg you, oh, oh
I see you just, you just ain't actin' right
Huh, that's okay

Everytime I need someone to be there
When I had me one of them crazy days
(I ain't gon' beg you)
Everytime I want someone to treat me like
They always said they were gon' treat me like
(I ain't gon' beg you)

Because I let you slide before
But I see you ain't gon' learn
Since you like to play with fire, then I'ma let us burn
(Boy you)
Ain't nothin'
(Gon' miss)
My lovin'
And last time was the last time, so I'm through with you

No I ain't gon' beg you no more
I'm sick and tired of waitin', don't know what I'm waitin' for
'Cause you know, you don't treat me like you should
When you know I'm the coldest thing about this hood

No, I ain't gon' beg you no more
And if you not down with this, then baby, there's a door
I'm usually not the type to just lay it down and quit
But a lotta men would get with it
So I ain't gon' beg you no more

Every time I wanna be wined and dined
Taken out on a Friday night, just spend a little time
(I ain't gon' beg you)
And everytime I need some huggin' and some lovin'
But it's late and I don't get nothin'
(I ain't gon' beg you)

'Cause I let you slide before
(Let you slide before)
But I see you ain't gon' learn
(See you ain't gon' learn)
Since you like to play with fire, then I'ma let us burn
Boy you
(Ain't nothin')
Gon' miss
(My lovin')
(And last time was the last time, so I'm through with you)

No, I ain't gon' beg you no more
I'm sick and tired of waitin', don't know what I'm waitin' for
'Cause you know, you don't treat me like you should
When you know I'm the coldest thing about this hood

No, I ain't gon' beg you no more
And if you not down with this, then baby, there's a door
I'm usually not the type to just lay it down and quit
But a lotta men would get with it
So I ain't gon' beg you no more

Said, I'm through with being patient
I ain't here for you just to come and
Take it when you wanna take it
You took it all for granted
Oh, all that good love and all that freaky stuff, is all gon'
If that's how you is, then let me tell you this
Take your lame old tired excuses somewhere else

'Cause you're weak and I don't wanna hear it
(You're weak and I don't wanna hear it)
Stay away I don't wanna get near it
'Cause boy, I'm movin' on without you

No, I ain't gon' beg you no more
I'm sick and tired of waitin', don't know what I'm waitin' for
'Cause you know, you don't treat me like you should
When you know I'm the coldest thing about this hood

No, I ain't gon' beg you no more
And if you not down with this, then baby, there's a door
I'm usually not the type to just lay it down and quit
But a lotta men would get with it
So I ain't gon' beg you no more

Ain't gon' beg you to love me
Ain't gon' beg you to hold me
Ain't gon' beg you to pick me up and take me out
I ain't gon' beg you to ice me
Ain't gon' beg you to want me
Ain't gon' beg you to do things a real man about

Ain't gon' beg you to love me
Ain't gon' beg you to hold me
Ain't gon' beg you to pick me up and take me out
I ain't gon' beg you to ice me
Ain't gon' beg you to wipe me
Ain't gon' beg you to do things a real man about
