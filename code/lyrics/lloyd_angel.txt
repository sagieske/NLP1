Song:

Heaven put an angel at my side
With wings like shelter in the night
Just hold me close for a little bit longer
Stay with me til the morning flight

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
'Cause they always fly away

Fly on angel go be free
Won't you come back home and dance(f**k) with me
Just hold me close for a little bit longer
Until heaven calls you away from me

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel

Give me wings to fly away
Like Icarus I'm having a bad day
See your shadow on the sun
As your flying far away

Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
Maybe I'm a fool to fall for angel
'Cause they always fly away
