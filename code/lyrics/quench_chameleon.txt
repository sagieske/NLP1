Song:

Look into these eyes of mine and tell me what you see
A broken man who's tortured by the things that should not be?
You said you left the past behind, no more compromise
You she'd your skin, got cleansed within, but now the rumours rise

Your colours shine so bright when we're together
But now I realise the real lies you can't disguise

You are my Chameleon – you twist and turn again
You are my Chameleon – you twist and turn again

This deceitful heart of mine, this love made me so blind
My wisdom tried to tell me not to hide the warning signs
Hold on to this faith of mine, in time I'll be alright
Refiners fire from funeral pyre; my flame is burning bright

Your colours shine so bright when we're together
When will you turn and face the past disgrace you can't misplace?

I know I'm dead to you
But I know I'm still alive
Cast out the ghost of you
No bitter root will choke my life
I know I'm dead to you (Do you know I pray for you?)
But I now feel so alive (Do you know I pray for you?)
I wish the best for you (Do you know I pray for you?)
Forgiveness brought me back to life
