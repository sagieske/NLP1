Song:

Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes
Imagination
Silently the senses
Abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls it's splendor
Grasp it, sense it
Tremulous and tender
Turn your face away
From the garish light of day.
Turn your thoughts away
From cold, unfeeling light,
And listen to the music of the night.

Close your eyes
And surrender to your darkest dreams.
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before.
Close your eyes,
Let your your spirit start to soar.
And you'll live as you've never lived before.

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you
Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind
Start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be.
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
