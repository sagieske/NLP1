Amber
Tracy Turnblad, this is for you.

They came from way far out
In outer space
And with her help
They may destroy the human race

Amber & guys
She's got cooties!

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
They've found a place to nest

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
If I were her I'd be depressed
Long tailed, sharp nailed
Fuzzy legs, laying eggs

In science class
She's like a walking show-and-tell
Her pet skunk ran away
'Cause it couldn't take the smell

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
Nobody want to sit by her

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
She don't need a coat
'Cause she's got fur!
Circle, circle,

All
Dot, dot, dot

Amber
Glad I got my cootie shot!
"Come on boys, let's stamp 'em out!"

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
She's just as friendly as can be

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
She shows them cootie hospitality

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
She's like a living "twilight zone"

Guys
She's got cooties

Girls
... Cooties

Amber
Quick, get rod serling on the phone!

Amber
Black, white, red, green

Amber & ensemble
Every color in between

Amber
Dresses like a circus clown

Amber & ensemble
Somebody oughta hose her down

Amber
Grew up in a cootie zoo
I bet her two-ton mama's got 'em too!

"And that's for you!"
