Song:

I can be replaced
By any pretty face
I'm a temporary thing
My fifteen minutes, they're ticking away

But I'm living for something more
Yeah I'm living for something

Beyond the walls of this world
Beyond the walls of this world
Well I know the sky is not the limit
My soul wants to fly and You can free it
Come on and let it soar
Beyond the walls of this world

Well there's a hunger I have inside
That bread alone can't satisfy
Let Your heart be my eyes
And my vain ambitions die

'Cause I'm living for something more
Yeah I'm living for something

Yeah I'm living for something more
Something more than this
Yeah I'm living for something
Something

Who said the sky was the limit
My soul will fly and You will free it
Beyond the walls
