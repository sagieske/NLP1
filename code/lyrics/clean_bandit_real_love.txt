Song:

Oooh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel
Oooh, you've got the feeling that I know is real, real real
It's in the way you look,
It's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk,
It's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real,
Real love
This is real, real, real,
Real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love

Oooh, before you I was searching for a rarity
Oooh, you showed me things I never thought that I would see
It's in the way you look,
It's in the way you love
And I can see that this is real
It's in the way you talk,
It's in the way you touch
And I can see
This is real, real, real,
Real love
This is real, real, real,
Real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love

Time won't waste and we'll just learn
To take it slow and wait out turn
Held my breath, 'cause I believe
That you'll find me

Real, real, real,
Real love
This is real, real, real,
Real love
You give me that love, real love
You give me that love, real love
You give me that love, real love

This is real, real, real,
Real love
This is real, real, real,
Real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love
You give me that feelin' you give me that feelin'
You give me that, you give real love
