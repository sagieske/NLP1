[Hook: Pharrell] x2
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
I got racks, racks, racks, 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do
You a bad ass bitch, a bad ass bitch
That don't get lost in the fat ass, bitch
I got racks, racks, racks 'til the ATM jam
Tell me what you wanna do

[Verse 1: Azealia Banks]
Thank u darly
Buy the barry
I can admit I likes to party
I spent a grip
I swipes the cardy
When I heist, I'mma drips my pricey garmy
I'm the swami
Hyphy hip-cat
I'm "freaky-fit-that"
I could rrrrrr-ip-pap (rap)
Ice on her wrist like high-sophis-chat
When I dyke with a bitch, that's spicy! Get that! 

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Azealia Banks]
Ayo P, do that freaky jam on the beat
Mix it with that butter shit
... 

[Bridge: Pharrell]
They shootin' in the parking lot
Everybody get low
They shootin' in the parking lot
It ain't where you wanna go
Now standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya
Standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya

[Hook]
