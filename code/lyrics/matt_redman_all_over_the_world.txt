Song:

Verse 1:
Even As the World began
The stars they sang and all the angels
Shouted for joy
Shouted for joy
And looking back through history
Your people they have always had
A song they must sing
A song they must sing

Prechorus:
We Are The People of God
We'll Sing Your Song
Here on the earth

Chorus:
All over the world Your song will resound
All over the world Your praises ring out
We're living to see You're name and renown
All over the world

Verse 2:
Young and old, near and far
There's a place for ev'ry heart to
Join in your song
Join in your song
And ev'ry nation tribe and tongue
Come together join as one
Give glory to God
Glory to God

Bridge:
Great is Your name
And great will be your song (repeat)
We lift up our hands and pray
We lift up our hands and pray
For holy is Your name

Other:
Your name, Your renown, are the desire of our souls
Your fame, Your glory, Your song,
For you alone are God, You alone.
