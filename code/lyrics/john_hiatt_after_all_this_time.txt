Song:

After all this time
I'm glad your loving me
'cause after all this time
So many disagree
To turn off the lights
Or pull down the shade
Don't be afraid
After all this time

And after all this time
I'm glad that you can see
After all this time
And I'm the man I want to be
Strong as your love
Free as the wind
Each day we begin
After all this time

After all this time
You love someone
And love's becoming you
After all this time
Face the sun
Everyday is new

After all this time
I'm glad I'm loving you
After all this time
We are the only two
Here in this world
A love that time forgot
But darlin' we will not
After all this time
(repeat)
