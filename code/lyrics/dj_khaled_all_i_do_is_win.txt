All I Do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind I can never get enough
And everytime I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Ludacris]
Ludacris goin in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up put em in the sky for the homies that didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that conjure
The hood call it Ludayac
And I'm on this foolish track so I spit my foolish flows
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix now I'm on the original version
Aint never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got 20 bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the souths champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is...

All I Do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind I can never get enough
And everytime I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Rick Ross]
Swerving in my Lolo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n*ggas call me Loco
That's for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that for-for
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life
Dirty money b*tch you better get your mud right
We come together holding hands and holla thug life
We are strapped in all black
It's like thug life
(All we do is win)
You riding the what
We riding the night
You riding with me cause you wasn't riding right
Ross...

All I Do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind I can never get enough
And everytime I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make em stay there

[Snoop Dogg]
Heat in the Kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope getting sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of them
Bust till I burst on em
Floss em up, toss em up, hardaway, boss em up
Pardon me I bossing the pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't wanna mess with us
We like the you in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B*tch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win

All I Do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind I can never get enough
And everytime I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make em stay there
