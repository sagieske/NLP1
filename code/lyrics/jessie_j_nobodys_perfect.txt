Song:

When I'm nervous, I have this thing yeah, I talk too much,
Sometimes I just can't shut the hell up.
It's like I need to tell someone, anyone who'll listen
And that's where I seem to fuck up. 

Yeah, I forget about the consequences,
For a minute there I lose my senses
And in the heat of the moment,
My mouth's starts going, the words start flowing, ohh

But I never meant to hurt you,
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love, like I wanna be loved,
This is a lesson learnt!

I hate that I let you down and I feel so bad about it!
I guess karma comes back around,
Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah.
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken,
So don't tell me you can't forgive me cause nobody's perfect, 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Nobody's perfect, no!

If I could turn back the hands of time,
I swear I never would've cross that line.
I should have kept it between us
But Jessie went and told the whole world how she's feeling ohh

So I sit and I realize
With these tears falling from my eyes,
I gotta change if I wanna keep you forever,
I'm promise that I'm gonna try!

But I never meant to hurt you,
I know it's time that I learnt to
Treat the people I love, like I wanna be loved,
This is a lesson learnt!

I hate that I let you down and I feel so bad about it!
I guess karma comes back around,
Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah.
And I hate that I made you think that the trust we had is broken,
So don't tell me you can't forgive me cause nobody's perfect, 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Nobody's perfect, no!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

I'm not a saint, no, not at all,
But what I did it, that wasn't cool,
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you!
Hey, no!

I'm not a saint (I'm not a saint!), No, not at all (no, not at all!),
But what I did (but what I did!), That wasn't cool (that wasn't cool!)
But I swear that I'll never do that again to you!
Hey!

And I hate that I let you down (let you down), 
And I feel so bad about it (feel so bad!)
I guess karma comes back around (karma comes back around)
Cause now I'm the one that's hurting, yeah!
And I hate that I made you think that (I hate that I made you think)
That the trust we had is broken (b-b-b-broken!)
So don't tell me you can't forgive me
Cause nobody's perfect.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

Nobody's perfect.
