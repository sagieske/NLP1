Song:

Background: Just ask the lonely

Levi Stubbs:
When you feel that need
To make it all alone,
Remember no one is thinking of,
Going alone

Just ask the lonely...
They know the hurt and pain,
Of losing a love, you can never regain

Background: Just ask the lonely
Levi: Just ask the lonely

Levi: The young and foolish laugh at love
Four Tops: Woo-hoo
Levi: So they run away...
Four Tops: Woo-hoo hoo hoo
Levi: Confident and sure that fate
Four Tops: Woo-hoo
Levi: Will bring another love their way

Background: Aaah
Levi: But ask the lonely....
Background: Aaah
How vainly a heart can yearn,
Background: Aaah
Levi: For losing a love that will never return

Background: Just ask the lonely
Levi: Just ask the lonely....
They'll tell you

Background: Ooooh, Woo-hoo hoo-hoo
Ooooooh

Background: Aaah
Levi: They'll tell you a story of sadness,
Background: Aaah
A story too hard to believe...
Background: Aaah
Levi: They'll tell you the loneliest one is me

Background: Just ask the lonely
Levi: Just ask the lonely

Levi: Ask me...
I'm the loneliest one you'll see

Background: Just ask the lonely
