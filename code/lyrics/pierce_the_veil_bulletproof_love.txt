Song:

I breathe you in with smoke
In the backyard lights
(Backyard lights)
We used to laugh until we choked
Into the wasted nights
(Wasted nights)
It was the best time of my life
But now I sleep alone
(Sleep alone)
So don't, don't, don't wake me up
'Cause my thrill is gone
(Say I'm wrong)
In the sunset turning red behind the smoke
Forever and alone
Yeah

You've gone and sewn me to this bed
The taste of you and me
(You and me)
Will never leave my lips again,
Under the blinding rain
(Blinding rain)
I wanna hold your hand so tight
I'm gonna break my wrist
(Break my wrist)
And when the vultures sing tonight
I'm gonna join right in

I'll sing along
'Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And now there's nothing to do but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair, no
Don't you try to blame this on me
My love for you was bulletproof
But you're the one who shot me
And goddamn it, I can barely say your name
So I'll try to write it
And fill the pen with blood from the sink

But, don't just say it, you should sing my name
Pretend that it's a song 'cause forever it's yours
And we can sing this on the way home

I'll sing along
'Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on
No, I'm barely hanging on
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone
And there's nothing to do
But tear my voice apart
Nothing to do and scream at the drunken moon
