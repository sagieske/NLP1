Song:

Away in a manger no crib for a bed
The little lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay
Little lord Jesus asleep in the hay

The cattle are a-lowing the baby he awakes
But the little lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love you ohhh Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh

Be near me Lord Jesus I asked you to stay
Close by me forever and love me I pray
Bless all of the children in your tender care
And keep us all together to live with you there
