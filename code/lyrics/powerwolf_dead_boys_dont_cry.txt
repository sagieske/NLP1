Song:

As proud as we're dead, the werewolves are back
Countdown the strike and prepare for attack
Pray when we take your life on this side
And you know soon you'll be dying
Cold are your veins, and when you deny
Dark is the night and alone you will die
Break all the chains and wait for the time
When you return with the night

Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die
You'll see them light the grave goodbye
Dead boys don't cry

When we come near don't hide in your bed
One night in hell and you wake up undead
Dead when the day, alive in the night
Gone with the morning horizon
Don't you dare say, the damned you adore
When you decide you can't take any more
Phantoms we are, and lonesome we ride
Into the dark of the night

Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die
You'll see them light the grave goodbye

Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys
Don't cry
Dead boys don't cry
