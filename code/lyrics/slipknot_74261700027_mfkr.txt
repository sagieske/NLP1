Song:

74261700027! 2x

Aaaargh!

Maze.. Psychopathic daze.. I create this waste and I think I'm going to sick or dead

Even if you run and go home
Even if you're one for sorrow

Go! Go! Go way and die to fast!

Hands on my face overbearing I think it's sick
Hands on my face overbearing I think..

Lost.. Running my own way and now I Know I'm f*****g gone, I'm f*****g Dying!

The whole thing I think is s**t
The whole thing I thinks is sick! 2x2

74261700027
There's something inside me
7261700027
There's something in you despise 2x2

Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat I don't wannabe the danger to myself! Hands on my face overbearing, I've lost myself, spirit, life and soul,
But I can'tdie 2x2

7261700027
There's something inside me
7261700027
There's something in your despise
Despise...

74261700027! 2x2
