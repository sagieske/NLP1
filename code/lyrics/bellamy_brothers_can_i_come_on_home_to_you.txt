Song:

Well I could apologize but it might be too late for that.
This time you could define it as more than just a lover's spat.
So I'll drink and think about what you told me I could do.
But after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?

I knew that other woman was as poison as they come.
But she flashed that s*** smile at me,
And like a man I acted dumb.
Though she offered me her body, I swear,
I could not go through.
So after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?

Is there something I can say,
Are there any feelings left inside?
Could we just rewind the time,
Before we say goodbye?

I guess there is no explanation that you ain't already heard.
So I'll be headin' down to Hades' to heed your every word.
And I'll walk barefoot on the brimstone,
Just to prove I can be true.
But after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?
Hey, then after I go to hell, can I come on home to you?
