Song:

Please don't make me wait too late tomorrow comes
And I will not be late
Late to day when it becomes tomorrow I will
Leave to go a-way

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Songs that lingered on my lips excite me now
And linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door I'll leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye

Far away my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to her side
When a song of lonely love invites me on
I must go to her side

Goodbye... Goodbye...
Goodbye, Goodbye, my love, Goodbye
