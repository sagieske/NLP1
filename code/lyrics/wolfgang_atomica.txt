Song:

Take my first steps into the morning
The sun no longer keeps me in place
A new day is dawning
A smile brakes out on my face
Awake so wide awake
I feel it in my fingers
And how it bleeds right through my veins
A new world I've discovered
The darkenss torn from my bones
Awake so wide awake
My little children you're all that I see
The life that's within you
So deeply I need
You feel me upon you
My eternal power
As all hope escapes you
With every hour
Live on live on eternally
Live on lie on inside of me
Now that I have you
Know that I love
What I can give you
You now also want too
Desire haunts you like a blazing fire
Burning inside you higher and higher
Live on live eternally
Live on live on inside of me
