Song:

I'm not scared, but this is happening
I'm not afraid, but this is real, this is real
It all comes at once
From every single direction
This time I'm not
I'm not sleeping at all
How could this be real
I've failed you, I've failed you

Chorus
I was lying when I said
I was looking north
I was too scared to show what I am
Bear with me bear with me
This is all I have left
This might be more
Than a simple conversation
Conversation!

It's been dancing around in my head
For quite some time
Just the thought
Of cleaning up myself

[Chorus:]

I'm not sleeping
I'm not sleeping at all
I stare at the wall
Watching my time float away
It's all been a blur
And nothing will change
I stare at the wall
Watching my time float away
It's all been a blur
And nothing will change

I was lying! 6X

This is defeat
