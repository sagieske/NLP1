Song:

Left abandoned and abused
Maybe iґm so confused
Take my chance and do my best
Better then the whole rest
Never change itґs just too late
We canґt be friends well think again now
I will realize my plan doing what I can

Never gonna chance never gonna chance
Fix me right and then
Weґll see whatґs coming on now
Take a little bit of this and that
Take a little bit of supersonic banners... Make me so sad
Supermega tony vega like a beggar like on an easy chair
I like it when youґre so aware
Supersonic games supersonic games
Whoґs to blame whoґs to b... B... B... B... Blame:

Big boy doubledecker makinґmy heart go quicker
Itґs a bad game-dreadful like migraine

To the ladies...
I feel iґm sleepinґthrough the cracks
Two times ryhminґon this track
Laughinґ ґbout the thing we did
Another day so uninspired

Never gonna chance never gonna chance
Fix me right and then
Weґll see whatґs coming on now
Take a little bit of this and that
Take a little bit of supersonic banners... Make me so sad
Supermega tony vega like a beggar like on an easy chair
I like it when youґre so aware
Supersonic games supersonic games
Whoґs to blame whoґs to b... B... B... B... Blame:

Big boy doubledecker makinґmy heart go quicker
Itґs a bad game-dreadful like migraine
