Song:

You're scared
It shows
Been there
You're not prepared to be
In love
With me
So soon cause you've been through enough to have
Something hold you back

We don't need to go that far
Let's hold on to where we are
If it's real we'll make it through
Cause all I need is you

They say
Don't waste
Your time
They're obviously blind

So let's
Forget
The words the thoughts they put into your head
Don't give up just yet

We don't need to go that far
Let's hold on to where we are
If it's real we'll make it through
Cause all I need is you

We don't need the world right now
We got time to work it out
Hold on tight, I'll hold on too
Cause all I need is --

Baby, maybe we should start somewhere
Baby, let me in your heart
Before we fall apart

We don't need to go too far
Let's hold on to who we are
If it's real we'll make it through
Cause all I need is you

We don't need the world right now
We got time to work it out
Hold on tight, I'll hold on too
Cause all I need is you
All I need is you
All I need is you
