Song:

No I’m never gonna leave you darling
No I’m never gonna go regardless
Everything inside of me, is leaving in your heartbeat
Even when all the lights are fading
Even then, if your hope was shaking
I’m here holding on

Chorus:
I will always be yours for ever and and more
For the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink till I’m drunk
And all that I’ve done, is it ever enough

I’m hanging on a line here baby
I need more than ifs and maybes
We’ll come down from the highest heights
Still searching for the reason why
And now I know what it’s like,
Reaching from the other side
After all that I’ve done

Chorus:
I will always be yours for ever and and more
For the push and the pull
I still drown in your love
And drink till I’m drunk
And all that I’ve done, is it ever enough

For all that it’s worth, is it worth it?
Cause more than it’s hard to desert it
For all that it’s worth, is it worth it?
How do we know without searching?

I will write you this song to get back what’s ours?
Would that be enough?

Chorus:
I will always be yours for ever and and more
For the push and the Wull
I still drown in your love
And drink till I’m drunk
And all that I’ve done, is it ever enough

For all that it’s worth, is it worth it?
Is it ever enough?
How could we know without searching?
Is it ever enough?
