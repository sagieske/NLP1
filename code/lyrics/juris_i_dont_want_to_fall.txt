Song:

I know that I'm no longer considered young
But with this feeling it's like teenage just began
I've gone through tough times
And I can say that I have grown
So I should be able to control what's going on

But no, this was not my intention
Oh no, just erase this connection cause I

I don't want to fall for you
I'm scared that you just might fall for me too
I don't want to feel for you
I'm scared that you just might feel for me too
Feel for me too¦ ooooh

You try too hard to hide the spark in your eyes
And I ignore it even if it excites me deep inside
Cause I'm strong and I know it's wrong
And to each other we simply don't belong
So I should be able to control what's going on

But no, this was not my intention, oh no
Oh no, lets just erase this connection cause I¦

I don't want to fall for you
I'm scared that you just might fall for me too
I don't want to feel for you
I'm scared that you just might feel for me too
I don't want to fall, fall for you
I'm scared that you just might fall for me too
And I don't want to feel for you
I'm scared that you just might feel for me too
Feel for me too¦ ooooh

Oooooh, this is dangerous
Lets not be adventurous
This could change our lives for the better
But what if for the worse?

I don't want to fall for you
