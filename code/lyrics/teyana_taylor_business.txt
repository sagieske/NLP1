Song:

[Verse:]
Every since the first time I laid eyes on you
I saw the truth
No questions, just proof
And they talk but ain't heard a thing they said bout you
Ever since the first time we made love 
Everybody want details, I don't say nothing 
I won't say nothing if you don't say nothing
Cause this is between us

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah, we gone fight but I'mma love you till it's alright
Ain't gone find these answers on sight
Boy, you don't need nobody's advice
Give me a shoulder to cry on and I'll be alright
I'll be the one you rely on

[Chorus:]
This love ain't none of yo friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, all ours, nobody else
None of yo friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
Boy, it's ours
None of yo friends business
Ain't none of my friends business
It's ours, boy it's ours
