Song:

In these moments of loss and torment
When the vast skies donâ€™t seem to call to you
When the weight of this world bears down
And the stars have fallen like tears

I am with you always
From the darkness of night 'til the morning
I am with you always
From life until death takes me

Monuments built in remembrance of me
But monuments fade and fall in decay
The memories are all that remains
As far as east is from the west, remember

I am with you always
From the darkness of night until the morning
I am with you always
From life until death takes me

When hope seems lost, down and lonely
I am here with you always

I am with you always
From the darkness of night
I am with you always
From the darkness of night until the morning
I am with you always
From life until death takes me

I am with you always
From life until death takes me
