Song:

You say you love me and what you'd do for me but you're uncertain, how will I react
You look real nervous, so scared that I'll turn and never look back
I didn't swear I would stay did I? I never thought you would doubt me that way
But if you need an answer in all honesty

You say you want me each day you love me deeper
Well baby and me you
You long to hold me, I make you're life much sweeter
That's how I feel for you too

I move real slowly, I guess it's just my way that doesn't mean I don't feel deep inside
When you're not with me I want to be there just holding you tight, so tight
It's not like I feel unsure my heart is focused like never before
And if you need an answer in all honesty

You say you want me each day you love me deeper
Well baby and me you
You long to hold me, I make you're life much sweeter
That's how I feel for you too

I believe didn't you didn't you tell it only me forever
There's no doubt that's how I feel for you too

You say you want me each day you love me deeper
Well baby and me you
You long to hold me, I make you're life much sweeter
That's how I feel for you too
