Song:

All I Want
(Hess/Lesperance)

Opened the door
To an ever changing time
Losing control
With no warning
No warning

So now you've come
To finally realize
This won't be done by morning
By morning

It's the end of the love
You're giving it up
The heartache won't let
You walk away
And the day's gonna come
You throw down your guns
You're saving it up
For another day
All I want is everything
I'll never get enough
What I want could never bring
All that I dream of
That day will come
When we are one

It's hard to ignore
What we've done to our lives
I'm keeping score
Now you own me
You own me
