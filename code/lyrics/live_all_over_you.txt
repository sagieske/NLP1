Song:

Our love is like water, pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other than me alone for me all day
Our love is like water, pinned down and abused
All over you, all over me, the sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea, the sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down

Our love is like water, pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other than me alone for me all day
Our love is like angels, pinned down and abused
All over you, all over me, the sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea, the sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down, pay me now, pay me now, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
All over you, all over me, all over you, all over me
Pay me now, lay me down, down, pay me now, pay me now, lay me down, lay me down, lay

Our love is like water, pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other than me alone
All over you, all over me, the sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea, the sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down, down, pay me now, pay me now, lay me down, lay me down, lay
