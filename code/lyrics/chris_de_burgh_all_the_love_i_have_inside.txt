Song:

When I wake up in the morning she is there,
With her sleepy smile and a long night of windy hair,
And when I hold her close beside me,
Well it feels so good,
That I'd like to stay here all day long,
If there's a way that I could;

And when we go downstairs and start off onto the day,
Just one more cup of coffee, and I'm on my way,
We may not have perfection,
But we're halfway there,
And I know it's sentimental,
But I just wanted to say,

That all the love I have inside me is for you,
All the love I have inside me is for you,
All the love I have inside me is for you;

And when I've had a heavy day and I'm going home,
She gives me time if she sees I want to be alone,
Ah but when the evening's over,
And we go to bed,
Here comes the same old feeling,
It's like a song in my head,

Well all the love I have inside me is for you,
All the love I have inside me is for you,
All the love I have inside me is for you;
Here's my love song to you, you...
