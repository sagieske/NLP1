Song:

I learn to walk
I learn to walk
I jump the lines
And count the clocks
I chase the trucks
I chase the trucks
If I can't make the next light first my heart will stop
My heart stops
And I'll do it to survive
Not fast enough oh

[Pre-chorus:]
Everything's gonna be alright
Tears will stop, we will dry the night
You got strong hands - spinning mind
But I…

[Chorus:]
Doubt my legs, doubt my legs
They're on the edge
But I don't want to fight the fear again
I keep hanging on, on to the wind
And hope I'll never blow away
Doubt my legs, doubt my legs
Onto the ice
I didn't ever mean to break your high
So I keep standing on
Onto the flakes
And hope I'll never let it melt away

I kill the sound
I kill the sound
If I can hear a single pin drop, be alarmed
I'll be alarmed
My skin is tingling like electric firearms
I'm undermined
I think you understand the pressure that I fight oh

[Pre-chorus:]
Everything's gonna be alright
Tears will stop, we will dry the night
You got strong hands - spinning mind
But I…

[Chorus:]
Doubt my legs, doubt my legs
They're on the edge
But I don't want to fight the fear again
I keep hanging on, on to the wind
And hope I'll never blow away
Doubt my legs, doubt my legs
Onto the ice
I didn't ever mean to break your high
So I keep standing on
Onto the flakes
And hope I'll never let it melt away

Again, again, again
