Song:

I wanted to find
Where I was going
Everything I tried
It took me to nowhere
Iwas so tired of just living my life
Waiting for a sign

Tou came to my side
Gave me direction
Strong on the inside
I shine for you lord
Now it's my life
Now I've made up my mind
To be all you want for me

All I do
Is live my life for you
I know it's true
I'll never let you go
All I do
I'd do anything for you
Everything is in your hands, so I get up
Get up and praise to you

And I know where
I'm going ( 2 x )
