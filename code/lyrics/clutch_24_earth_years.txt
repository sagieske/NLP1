Song:

I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old.
And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century.
I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words,
"Take a look what the cat dragged in; a red woodpecker and two of my kin."
Back in 1980, we played the ad&D.
That game was harder than the Elfstones of Shanara.
My character was baffling, a druid, wizard, halfling.
On top of that he was master of psionic powers.
Bring on the hordes, we have the sword
That smote the Goblin of Gygaxnor.
Pray that the sisters name us as victors
Of the twenty sided die.
I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old.
And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century.
I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words,
"Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin."
Long ago in Middle Earth
A man could measure all his worth
By his blade and by his staff,
And by the runes on his epitaph.
Go mount your horse and ride up north
To seek the Baron of the Frozen Berg.
Ask for assistance in the resistance
Of the twenty sided die.
I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old.
And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century.
I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words,
"Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin."
Saw Mazes and Monsters, Tom Hanks completely bonkers.
He spoke what he doth speaketh in Elizabethan.
Sad lad, he really couldn't handle starting from scratch on the very first level
But he died the death of a warrior.
A legend grows yearly by way of a local song.
The bishop and castle move in defense of pawns.
I'm rolling, I'm tumbling a twenty sided die.
A legend grows yearly by way of local song.
I don't know, but I've been told I'm about twenty-four Earth years old.
And come my next birthday it'll be a quarter century.
I don't know, but I have heard a gnome from the old world say these words,
"Take a look what the cat dragged in; a dead woodpecker and two of my kin."
