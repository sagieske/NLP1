Song:

Almost there, we're almost there
How wonderful, wonderful our love will be
For you, for me

We're almost there where we will share
A warm caress, tenderness, a dream come true
For me, for you

Love has waited such a long time
Now we're a kiss apart
Darling, this is the right time
To let the kisses start

For you're almost mine and soon we'll find
Our paradise, paradise so rare
Close your eyes and we're almost there

You're almost mine and soon we'll find
Our paradise, paradise so rare
Close your eyes, close your eyes
Close your eyes and we're almost there
Almo-o-ost there
A-a-almost there
