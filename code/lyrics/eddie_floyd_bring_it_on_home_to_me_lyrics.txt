Song:

If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind
Please bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah

I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself
Please bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah

I'd give you jewelry and money too
That ain't all, that ain't all I'd do for you
If you'd bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah

You know I'll always be your slave
Till I'm buried, buried in my grave
Please bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah

I try to treat you right
But you stay out, stay out late at night
Please bring it to me
Bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Yeah yeah yeah
