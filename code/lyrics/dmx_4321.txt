[Redman] Hahh [Method] hah
[Method] Yeah [Redman] yeahhh
[Ll Cool J] Make it butter
[Redman] I'm gonna Bankhead bounce!
[Ll Cool J] No doubt
[Redman] Aiyyo watch yo mouth!

[Redman] Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven
Blaze the hot
[Ll Cool J] trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
My mon Meth-Tical come and get some

[Method Man]
Playin my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin
On mc's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but f**k ugly, tap your jaw
From my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie, runnin who?
Fuckin punk, get a speed bump comin through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a n***a, s**t it on a n***a
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe
S**t I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
S**t I'm drivin in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick a** till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the p****
Tell you f**k you my attitude is anemic

[Canibus]
I'm the illest n***a alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attatched to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin ni***z to death and beatin dead ni***z to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, "Yo, how many rhymes you got?" I think I'll go on
For more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
N***a, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to s**t on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any n***a that want it

[Dmx]
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?
Don't be a stupid n***a, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink n***a, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

[Redman] Aiyyo, one [Meth] two [Red] three [Meth] four
[Red] five [Meth] six [Red] seven
Blaze the hot trizack
[Method] Shine like heaven
Seven [Red] six [Meth] five [Red] four
[Meth] three [Red] two [Meth] one
[Redman] Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!

[Ll Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little a** should be somewher cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this s**t for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis ("LL Cool J is hard")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin up a ball, playin with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challengin Roy to a fight
Snappin, you ameteur mc's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uhh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad n***a you wanna socalize
And I'm daring every mc in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy a** was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
Ll Cool J n***a, greatest of all time
