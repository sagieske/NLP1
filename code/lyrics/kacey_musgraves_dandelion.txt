Song:

Picked you out and picked you up
Hopin' that my luck would change
Let the summer fill my lungs
Superstition fill my brain

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and a waste of time, I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me crying
Dandelion

Send you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinkin' it could change my world

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and a waste of time, I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me crying
Dandelion

Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more

Oh, dandelion, woah
Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowin' kisses out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and a waste of time, I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me crying
Dandelion
Dandelion
