Song:

It's been here since you've been gone
It's been hanging round too long
A thing called sadness not much of a friend
When you walked out it walked in.

In every chair where I sit down
It follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend
When you walked out it walked in.

What in the world am I gonna do
This old friend can't take the place of you
It only brings back mem'ries of you
And all the things that we used to do.

In every chair where I sit down
It follows me all over town
A thing called sadness not much of a friend
When you walked out it walked in...
