Song:

Torment in your brain
You won't feel much pain
Numbness setting in
But you won't give in
Evil all around
Menace you have found
Destroyed, brain death
No remorse, nothing left

[Chorus:]
Hatred for mankind
Seize your frozen mind
Uncontrolled despair
Killing without care

Crawling through your mind
Terror you will find
Anguish, ripping flesh
Torture, Satan's blessed
Trying to get free
Ray of hope you will see
No chance, death is chosen
Decayed brain, your mind is frozen

[Chorus:]
