Song:

The sun looks down on another day
And I stumble on, and I stumble on through it
So bright, so I look away to another day

And these words that don't come easy now
I'll sing inside my dreams...
And the rain falls down on another day
And it covers me, it covers me over
So cold and I wanna stay
But I walk away

CHORUS
And this land that You have called me to
By faith I'll gladly go
Through this wilderness of trials
To the Promise Land
I'll known on another day

The sky fell down only yesterday
And it buried me, it buried me under
So dark that I lost my way and I went astray
But my wandering would soon take root
In everything You say

And the moon shines down on another day
Lord, you beckon me
You beckon me closer
So far buy I'll find my way to a brighter day

CHORUS

BRIDGE
I've wandered down a thousand roads
And now I'm back where I began
I've been gone so long
But I'll stand in your light again

And the Lord looks down on another day
And the waters part, the waters part so wide
So soft, I can hear Him say,
"Don't you walk away, there's another day"
