Song:

Above the fold of covers ten thousand volts hit
Where her arm fell accidentally
But she didn't move it despite the singing skin
You didn't move yours either, did you though?

Never knew anyone in love, never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were

What other people call passion is one frame of your film
One frame seen accidentally
How could a love like this one remain among us?
It was a love that had to, had to leave

Never knew anyone in love, never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were

Don't be surprised if there's a book about it
Based roughly on a film about it
Something on your tv about it
And then, now a song about it, alright

Never knew anyone in love, never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were

Never knew anyone in love, never knew anyone in love
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were
Never knew anyone in love the way that you were

Never knew anyone, never knew anyone
Never knew anyone, never knew anyone
Never knew anyone in love
