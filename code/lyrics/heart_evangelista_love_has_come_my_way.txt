Song:

Love Has Come My Way
By Heart Evangelista

The sun is down it's a gloomy day
My hair is ugly and it looks like hay
I feel so lousy, I could fade away
But its ok
Because Love has come my way

My pretty dress won't fit to
My dismay
And all I wanna do is sing and play
I'm super lazy, need some brewed
Caffee. But It's ok
Because love has come my way

Chorus:
Love, love has come my way
Everything is gonna be ok
And it will always be a happy day
Because love has come my way

All my fears and troubles fly away
When I think this love is here to stay
And you may say this is just an cliche,
Sure it's ok
Because love has come my way

(Repeat Chorus)

I just know we'll never go astray
I'm sure until the day our hair turns gray
Life will be as pretty as a bouquet
That's the love true love that came
My way

Coda:
Love, love has come my way
Everything is gonna be ok
And it will always be a happy day
Because love has come my way

(Repeat 4x til fade)
