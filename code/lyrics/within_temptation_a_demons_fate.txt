Song:

Ohhohoho

You'll burn this time
Seeing the violence it's speeding my mind
No one is saving you
How can you find a Heaven in this Hell
Leave it behind your silence,
It screams our goodbye
Cannot believe it's an eye for an eye
Let us go to waste

[Chorus:]
Angels have faith
I don't want to be a part of his sin
I don't want to get lost in his world
I'm not playing his game

When the shadows remain
In the light of day
On the wings of darkness he'll retaliate
He'll be fallen from grace
Until the end of all his days
From the ashes and hate
It's a cruel Demon's Fate
On the wings of darkness he's returned to stay
There will be no escape
Cause he's fallen far from grace

Ohhohoho

What have you done
Is this what you wanted
What have you become
Your soul's now forsaken
You're walking alone
From Heaven to Hell

Now that you know
Your way in this madness
Your powers have grown
Your chains have been broken
You suffered so long
You will never change

[Chorus:]

Ohhohoho

[Chorus:]
