Song:

Alanis Morissette & Ryan Adams

Ryan :
I was born in 1974
On a calm meticulous street
Someplace in the sun
Oh the air was sweet
And enough lights sprang sparks
Through the window of the room
Not as raw to a ridiculous tune
Slightly out of key in the mother hour

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
I'm busy breaking bones

Alanis :
I was born in 1974
In a breached feet-first way
My twin opened the door
My very first dose of chivalry
I was dawned princess potential potent
With gold star and matching impression
Big between two doors
Small and loved and proud and unthreatened

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
So leave me alone
I'm busy breaking bones

Ryan :
I bet you were strong
When you should have been weak
Like a dam that wanted to break
I wish I were the stones
Your river learned to roam
In whispering gaze

Alanis :
You were told in a kind North Carolinian way
To slow down, back up, or be hated
Thank god you did not
And thank god you did
An angel either way

Ryan & Alanis :
So leave us alone
So leave us alone
So leave us alone
We're busy being grown
