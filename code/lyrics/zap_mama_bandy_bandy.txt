Song:

Like bandy bandy
Wave ya body like bandy bandy yeah
Ooh
Like bandy bandy
Wave ya body like bandy bandy yeah

When the day gets too long
When its so right now feel so wrong
Listen to what I say
See if you don't agree
Theres something I learned long ago
Down where the blu waters flow
Something people do to et their spirits free

In the morning time
In the afternoon
In the cool evening breeze

Like bandy bandy wave ya body
Like bandy bandy yeah
Ooh
Like bandy bandy wave ya body like bandy bandy yeah
Ooh

Any time of the day
Wave
Any place
Wave
If you feelin down
Wave-move ya body like a bendy snake

If you feel the day
Wave
Anyplace that you happen to be
Wave
If you feelin low
Wave
Just do what you need

Int he morning time
In the afternoon
In the cool evening breeze

(2x)like bandy bandy
Wave ya body
Like bandy bandy yeah
Ooh

(2x)Take the time
Fill the day
Fill the light
Fill the day
Fill the night take a breath
Fill yourself full of light
Shine(shine)
Until you feel your soul away
