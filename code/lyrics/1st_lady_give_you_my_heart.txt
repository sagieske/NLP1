Song:

Everytime I look above
I see your pretty face
And everytime I dream about
I think a special place
And where we can be together
And reminisce
About the moe days
That we always miss
Remember all the days
That when we were in school
And you know this baby girl
I want at the foo
Baby girl you're the only one that I hold
The only one I heard
When the stats gets cold
So just think about the future
And how we be so harmful
All the time
Day and night
I try to stay truthful
I won't ever give you up
To any other man
I'll always stick with you
As long as I can
So just open up your heart
And got me within
If our love is cherished
We'd always win
Cuz' you know we'll give em
Both of our hearts
Just for you and me
To have a clean start

Chorus:

Gonna stick with you
Through thick and thin
Never gonna give you up
And I'll always stay true
Until the days
When we are gonna win
I love you girl
From the very start
Gonna give you my heart
Until the days get dark
I'll make you better
Cuz' you know I'm down
For whatever...

I told you once before
That I'll never leave you
And I promise you
That I'll wait for you
Until that special day
When I can feel your touch the kind
That I been longing for so much
Baby your the only one I want
And no matter the distance
Cuz' before I met you
Didn't know love existence
And how it can make me feel
But I'm glad
That I'm feelin' it with you
And that's the reason why
So you know
No one makes me feel
The way you do
Please believe me
When I tell you
That my love is true
And then I will never
Ever replace you
I want you to give me ur kiss
To be the one I live,
With the one I marry too
Who makes my dreams come true
To this close
On and on
Cuz' when it comes to us
There's no end to it

Chorus:

Gonna stick with you
Through thick and thin
Never gonna give you up
And I'll always stay true
Until the days
When we are gonna win
I love you girl
From the very start
Gonna give you my heart
Until the days get dark
I'll make you better
Cuz' you know I'm down
For whatever...

Baby, I'll be soldier
I'll be your everything
Ain't no other man
That they can bring the joy
Like I bring
Cuz' you know
No one else sit down for you
A man that's how to be true to baby boo
Cuz' I'll always feel special
Whenever I'm with yah
How I'll never make a move
Unless I try to kiss yah
Ain't no other man
Will take my spot
We'll both make our words
Until the very very top
You knew baby girl
That you can truly love
We'll both make love
And we'll share ourself above
We'll both promise
Will be true until eternity
Cuz' you know I promise
Is what makes my beat
Special and experience
With a special someone
Share true patient with that
One and only someone
True love is promised
They will never break apart
They used to be single
Now they both matched hearts

Chorus:

Gonna stick with you
Through thick and thin
Never gonna give you up
And I'll always stay true
Until the days
When we are gonna win
I love you girl
From the very start
Gonna give you my heart
Until the days get dark
I'll make you better
Cuz' you know I'm down
For whatever...

Gonna stick with you
Through thick and thin
Never gonna give you up
And I'll always stay true
Until the days
When we are gonna win
I love you girl
From the very start
Gonna give you my heart
Until the days get dark
I'll make you better
Cuz' you know I'm down
For whatever...
