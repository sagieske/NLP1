Song:

Summer of '69
Straight from the heart
It's only love
Can't stop this things we started
Do I have to say the words?
This time
Run to you
Heaven
Cuts like a knife
(Everything I do) I do it for you
Somebody
Kids wanna rock
Heat of the night
Please forgive me

Summer of '69

I got my first real six string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far

But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya - I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you - ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Back in the summer of '69

Man we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no...

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life

Back in the summer of '69

Straight from the heart

I could start dreamin' but it'd never end
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You said it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I'll see you on the street some other time
And all our words would just fall outta line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

It's only love

When the feelin' is ended
There ain't no use pretendin'
Don't ya worry - It's only love

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over - It's only love
And that's all - yeah

When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy - but it's only love

And your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember - that it's only love

You can live without the aggravation
Ya gotta wanna win - ya gotta wanna win
You keep lookin' back in desperation
Over and over and over again

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over - It's only love

And if your life ain't worth livin'
And you're ready to give in
Just remember - that it's only love
Ya - that's all

Ya it ain't easy baby
But it's only love - and that's all

Can't stop this thing we started

You might stop a hurricane
Might even stop the drivin' rain
You might have a dozen other guys
But if you wanna stop me baby - don't even try
I'm goin' one way - your way
It's such a strong way - let's make it our way

Can't stop this thing we started
Ya gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we plotted
This thing called love we got it
No place for the broken hearted
Can't stop this thing we started - no way
I'm goin' your way!

You might stop the world spinnin' 'round
Might even walk on holy ground
I ain't superman and I can't fly
But if you wanna stop me baby - don't even try
I'm goin' one way - your way
It's such a strong way - let's make it our way

Can't stop this thing we started
Ya gotta know it's right
Can't stop this course we plotted
This thing called love we got it
No place for the broken hearted
Can't stop this thing we started - no way
I'm goin' your way!

Oh - why take it slow
I gotta know
Nothin' can stop - this thing that we got

Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from the mire
Whisper words of desire
Rescue me - darlin' rescue me

With your arms open wide
Want you here by my side
Come to me - darlin' rescue me
When this world's closin' in
There's no need to pretend
Set me free - darlin' rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standin' in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you - how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

Rescue me from despair
Tell me you will be there
Help me please - darlin' rescue me

Every dream that we share
Every cross that we bear
Can't you see - darlin' rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
So I'm standin' in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words?
Do I have to tell the truth?
Do I have to shout it out?
Do I have to say a prayer?
Must I prove to you - how good we are together?
Do I have to say the words?

This time

I think about her all the time
She's my fantasy
An image burnin' in my mind
Callin' out to me

While my imagination's runnin' wild
Yeah - things are getting clearer

This time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
And day - I'm gonna make her mine

I've thought of every word I'd say
Give or take a few
But she turns and slowly walks away
What am I supposed to do

Hey - turn up your radio
Oh - there's somethin' I want you to know

This time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
And day - I'm gonna make her mine

Well it's hard to take cause she's miles away
And I've waited a long time
But the feelin's right and darlin' one of these nights
Yeah - I'm gonna let you know

This time everything is all right
No way she's gonna get away
This time everything is easy
And day - I'm gonna make her mine

Run to you

She says her love for me could never die
But that'd change if she ever found out about you and I

Oh - but her love is cold
It wouldn't hurt her if she didn't know, cause...

When it gets too much
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

She's got a heart of gold she'd never let me down
But you're the one that always turns me on
You keep me comin' 'round

I know her love is true
But it's so damn easy makin' love to you

I got my mind made up
I need to feel your touch

I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Cause when the feelin's right I'm gonna stay all night

I'm gonna run to you
Ya - I'm gonna run to you
Oh when the feelin's right I'm gonna run all night
I'm gonna run to you

Heaven

Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We bin down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh - once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Ya - nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

N' baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

I've bin waitin' for so long
For something to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you

Cuts like A knife

Drivin' home this evenin'
Coulda sworn we had it all worked out
You had this boy believin' way beyond a shadow of a doubt

Then I heard it on the street
I heard ya might of found somebody new
Well who is he baby - who is he and tell me what he means to you

I took it for granted - but how was I to know
That you'd be lettin' go
Now it cuts like a knife - but it feels so right
It cuts like a knife - but it feels so right

There's times I've bin mistaken
There's times I've thought I've bin misunderstood
So wait a minute darlin' - can't you see we did the best we could

This wouldn't be the first time - that things have gone astray
Now you've thrown it all away

Now it cuts like a knife - but it feels so right
It cuts like a knife - but it feels so right

(Everything I do) I do it for you

Look into my eyes - you will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart - search your soul
And when you find me there you'll search no more

Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Look into my heart - you will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am - take my life
I would give it all - I would sacrifice

Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

There's no love - like your love
And no other - could give more love
There's nowhere - unless you're there
All the time - all the way

Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - ya I'd die for you

Ya know it's true
Everything I do - I do it for you

Somebody

I bin lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain

Now who can you turn to
When it's all black 'n' white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
Doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for

I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
And your eyes were like diamonds
And they cut right through - Oh they cut right through

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
We all need somebody

Another night another lesson learned
It's the distance that keeps us sane
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again - all again

I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody

I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody

Kids wanna rock

Turned on the radio
Sounded like a disco
Musta turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find no rock n' roll

This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock

London to la
Talk about the New Wave
For a couple of bucks ya get a weird haircut
And waste your life away

Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock

Get me my dj
I got somethin' he's gotta play
Wanna hear it I can't wait
So turn it up - turn it up...

Kick down the barricades
Listen what the kids say
From time to time people change their minds
But the music is here to stay

I've seen it all from the bottom to the top
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock

Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock
Everywhere I go - the kids wanna rock

Heat of the night

I was caught in the crossfire of a silent scream
Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the cover up high - and pray for the mornin' light
Cause you're livin' alone - in the heat of the night

Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight (Ya that's right)
Better leave it alone - in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
There'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where ya gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night

Please forgive me

Still feels like our first night together
Feels like the first kiss
It's gettin' better baby
No one can better this
Still holdin' on, you're still the one
First time our eyes met - same feelin' I get
Only feels much stronger - wanna love ya longer
You still turn the fire on...
So if you're feelin' lonely don't - you're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good - so if I love ya a little more than I should

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me - this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need ya like I do
Please believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you

Still feels like our best times are together
Feels like the first touch - still gettin' closer baby
Can't get close enough
Still holdin' on - still number one
I remember the smell of your skin - I remember everything
I remember all your moves - I remember you yeah
I remember the nights - ya know I still do
So if you're feelin' lonely don't - you're the only one I ever want
I only wanna make it good - so if I love ya a little more than I should

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need ya like I do
Oh believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you

One thing I'm sure of - is the way we make love
And one thing I depend on - is for us to stay strong
With every word and every breath I'm prayin'
That's why I'm sayin'

Please forgive me - I know not what I do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Don't deny me this pain I'm going through
Please forgive me - if I need ya like I do
Babe believe me - every word I say is true
Please forgive me - if I can't stop lovin' you
Never leave me - I don't know what I'd do
Please forgive me - I can't stop lovin' you
Can't stop lovin' you
