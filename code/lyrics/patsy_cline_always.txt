Written by irving berlin
(as recorded by patsy cline, february 5, 1963)

I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
And, not for just a year, but, always
