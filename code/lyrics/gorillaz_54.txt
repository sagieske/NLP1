Song:

Budge up for me
Budge up, make no sound
It good for me
It good for the underground

Magic on me
Really got me down
Invade the city
It make my heart beat no sound

Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Beat no sound
Beat no sound
Beat no sound (ooh ooh ooh ooh)

And let me tell myself
Tell on
She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on
Dad on
Dad on!

Budge up for me
Budge up, let me through
We pledge it money
People seem to walk through you

Magic's funny
Magic get me through
All good for me
When people seem to always walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you
Walk through you (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Walk through you
Walk through you

And let me tell myself
Tell on
She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on
Dad on
Dad on

She made me kill myself
Come on
Come on

She turned my dad on
Come on
She turned my dad on
Come on
She turned my dad on
She turned my dad on
Dad on
Dad on
