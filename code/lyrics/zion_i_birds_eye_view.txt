Song:

[Zion whispers] I got a bird's eye view
[Girl in the background] Hip hop, is so many things you can say about it, know what I mean?
Like, on the real, hip hop is like, just, beautiful
Hip hop is life

[Verse:]
From the first time I saw you, infatuation
Pulled to the side to provide conversation
Wild reputation but you were so cool
Any old fool knew that you was a jewel
Ghetto to ghetto, your influence settled
More hardcore than r&b but not metal
Blacker than a kennel, you made me feel mellow
Introduction to my life, I said "hello"
Meet me in a minute 'cause I gotta finish school
Some of my homies, they never finished puffin' woo's
Stayin' up late, always studying the tapes

The world watched you fall in love, I guess fate had a,
Grip on my mind state, I wanna rhyme, wait
I fell in line, getting signed at the wrong gates
And so my heart braced at first for real
But I would still be lovin' you 'cause deep is what I feel

I got a bird's eye view (hip hop... The realness)
I be wit'chu, I be there wit'chu
I be wit'chu, I be there wit'chu
[X2]

[Verse 2:]
She's the one I always count on, one that wouldn't leave me
One that's in the city always written in graffiti
One that keeps me company, when I'm all alone
She's my heart, my mind, my spirit and my bones
She's the only one I know that would go across the globe
Meet me in a foreign land, treat me like I'm home
Everything I own, give to her, she deserves it
Treats me like a king, every syllable is perfect
Searched through the earth for a reason just to be here
And since I met her every moment's like a leap year
Baby you can sleep here, you can stay with me
Anywhere you go, know I'm probably gon' be
Full of energy, and you never acting tired
You're everything I need, when I prayed, God supplied
You my chunky fire, blessings you provide
Always in my life 'til the day that I die

I got a bird's eye view (hip hop... The realness)
I be wit'chu, I be there wit'chu
I be wit'chu, I be there wit'chu
[X2]

(Hip hop, hip hop, hip hop... Is life)
