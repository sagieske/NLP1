Song:

Burn the rich kids trash their toys
Time for girls to act like little boys

I'm in the mood to celebrate
I'm feeling like it's time to tear
The walls down seal my fate

Children this is armageddon,
The revelation's come
We're the armageddon terrorists
And it's such a lot of fun
Welcome into armageddon
Leave your hope outside the door
We are armageddon's babies,
The juggernaut

Put on mummy's favourite dress
Help her lover simply phosphoresce
Shock the teeth out of those automatic fools
It's a joy to be so cruel

I'm in the mood to devastate
I'm feeling like the time has come
To open up the gate

Children this is armageddon,
The revelation's come
We're the armageddon terrorists
And it's such a lot of fun
Welcome into armageddon
Leave your hope outside the door
We are armageddon's babies,
A dream is born

This ain't Nirvana, this is Hades
The man at the door preaches access for all
