Verse 1:
On the 8th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A pair of Chloe shades & a diamond belly ring
On the 7th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A nice back rub and he massaged my feet
On the 6th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A crop jacket with dirty denim jeans
On the 5th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A poem that he wrote for me

Bridge:
The feelin' that I feel is so good
He makes me feel so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If he only knew what he does to me
My man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so s***
I'm so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love
How I love him for his generousity
My man, my man, my baby

Chorus:
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(it feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (it feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(wooooooooaaaaaaahhhh)
Yes it feels like x-mas
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(it feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(it feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(the spirit of x-mas)
Yes it feels like Christmas

Verse 2:
On the 4th day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A candlelit dinner just me & my honey
On the 3rd day of Christmas my baby gave to me
A gift certificate to get my favorite cd's
On the 2nd day of Christmas my baby gave to me
The keys to a clk Mercedes
On the 1st day of Christmas my baby gave to me
Quality T-I-M-E

Bridge:
The the feelin' that I feel is so good
He makes me feel so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If he only knew what he does to me
My man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so s***
I'm so in lo-lo-lo-lo-love
How I love him for his generousity
My man, my man, my baby

Doesn't it feel like Christmas(it feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (it feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas(wooooooooaaaaaaahhhh)

Doesn't it feel like Christmas(the spirit of x-mas)
Yes it feels like Christmas
