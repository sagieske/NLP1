Song:

We were coastin' on the coast when you opened my eyes
Made me notice where the ocean is holding the sky, right
I was blinded, your smile shining behind those green eyes
The horizon so enticing please say you'll be mine

Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself because nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when
The world is speedin'
I am still sleepin'
In my blue dream and
I know the meaning
For all the seasons
You are the reason
My love

My mind is open
So wide since you came inside
I feel so alive
Without you life just passes by
Passes by, passes by

Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself because nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when
The world is sleeping
I am still thinking
Of my blue dream
It's, bliss...

Don't wake me up cause I'm in love with all that you are
You make me see the truth in things, I think that you are
The remedy for everything it seems that you are
The truth itself because nothing else can take me so far

My afternoon dream when
The world is sleeping
I am still thinking
Of my blue dream
It's, bliss...
