Song:

I can feel you breathing
With your hair on my skin
As we lie in the deep of our bed

I pull those sheets
When it's cold on your feet
Cause you'll fall back to sleep every time.

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
Oh the best it could be
You and I

Our hands they might age
And our bodies will change
But we'll still be the same as we are

We'll still sing our song
When our hair ain't so blonde
And our children have songs
You and I

Grow old with me
Let us share what we see
Oh the best it could be
You and I (ooohhh)

The hairs they stand up
My feet start to thump
And the feeling of dreaming will rise

Youll be the one
Make me hard, make me come
Make me feel like I'm feeling alive

Yeah, grow old with me
Let us share what we see
Oh the best it could be
You and I.
