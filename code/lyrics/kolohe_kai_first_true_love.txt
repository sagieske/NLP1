Song:

I got it I got it the note you gave me when you left
Mmhhmm mmmmhhhmmm
Still got it still got it lying exactly where you left it
My heart broke in two, 
There was no super glue to mend it
Yeah, I was stuck on you
Didn't know how to end it.
Yeah yeah yeah

CHORUS:
You are my fifth, fourth or third seconds not the word
You are my first my first true love
Sad to say to this very day
Your still the one I'm thinking of
Cause your my first true love

It's over it's over
I still don't even know I'm worked over
And lately oh lately
I've had those questions on my mind
Mmmhhhmmmm oh
There was no such cure I endure you letter
Mmmmm the only thing that helps
Is my friends saying I can do better
Yeah yeah yeah

CHORUS:

You are my fifth, fourth or third seconds not the word
You are my first my first true love
Sad to say to this very day
Your still the one I'm thinking of
Cause your my first true love

Fifth fourth or third seconds not the word
You are my first my first true love
Sad to say from this very day
Your still the one I'm thinking of
Cause your my first true love

I need to surf
Cause it's killing me
No one to hurt
Love is leavin' me
I'd rather sing than be cryin'
Over you

I need to surf
Cause it's killing me
No one to hurt
Love is leavin' me
I'd rather sing than be cryin'
Over you

I never felt this blue

You are my fifth, fourth or third seconds not the word
You are my first my first true love
Sad to say to this very day
Your still the one I'm thinking of
Cause your my first true love
