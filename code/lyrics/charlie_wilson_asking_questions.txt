Song:

I aint askin questions
Im only here to do one thing, one thing yea
I aint askin questions oo weeee
Im only here to make you feel good make you feel good
When someone like you needs someone like me,
You know where to find me
At the club where we used to go to
When someone like you needs someone like me
At twelve in the mornin?
It can only mean one thing
You wanna be
Held in the right way
You wanna be
Touched in the right place
You wanna be
Known by your first name very first name
Girl it's cool with me
Cus
I aint askin questions
I aint askin questions
Im only here to do one thing one thing yea
I aint asking questions
Im only here to make you feel good make you feel good
I aint askin questions ooooo
Im only here to do one thing doooo one thing baby
I aint asking questions ooo weee
Im only here to make you feel good


When someone like you
Wants someone like me
There aint too much talking
Cause you want all the sex you came for

When someone like you baby
Spends the whole night with me
The fun doesn?t end with
A few kisses at the door before you go
You wanna be
Held in the right way
You wanna be
Touched in the right place
You wanna be
Known by your first name
Girl that?s cool with me
Because
I aint asking questions

Im only here to do one thing one thing baby
I aint asking questions oo wee
Im only here to make you feel good here make you feel good
