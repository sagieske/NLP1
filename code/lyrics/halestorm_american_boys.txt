Song:

Friday night boys and the pbr
Chasing Jack, getting wrecked
In small town bars
You're a big city roller
In N-Y-C
You're a sharp dressed man
Just like zz

Harley ridin' biker in a leather jacket
I like riding b***h
Or sitting on the back
Pretty boys at the university
Watching them walk
In their Levi jeans

I can't help but fall
God bless em all

American boys
Gotta love em, gotta need em
Gotta want em
They're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay em, wanna lay em
Wanna play em
They're my favourite toys
American, American boys

Metal head boys
In the back of a Camaro
Banging to Metallica
On the radio
From an all-star stud
To a punk like you
We've got so many flavors
That I just can't choose

They rock the world
Of this American girl

American boys
Gotta love em, gotta need em
Gotta want em
They're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay em, wanna lay em
Wanna play em
They're my favourite toys
American, American boys

[Solo]

I've been every where
And nothing compares
(American boys)
Ain't nothing like em
Rock me like em, yeah
(American boys)

Now make a move
Do what you do

American boys
Gotta love em, gotta need em
Gotta want em
They're my drug of choice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
American boys
Wanna slay em, wanna lay em
Wanna play em
They're my favourite toys
American boys
