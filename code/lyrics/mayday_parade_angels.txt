Song:

Three years of something,
I call love,
Every phone calls and photographs,
Were never enough,
To save the heart that's been broken,
So close to screaming,
This can't be happening,

I must be dreaming,
What's the worse that could happen,
I never knew,
When all I ever wanted was to get away from you,
But now the possibles, impossible,
And I can't refuse,
Grab all your drinks and raise all your glasses,

Lets toast, To the lucky ones,
To the girl, That just broke my heart.
I can't breathe,
After all that you've told me,
You took my heart and made me melt again

I could never imagine the end of this way,
After all we went through,
Now fighting through the pain,
It's like this heart that's been broken,
And so close to screaming,
Was ripped from my chest and I can't stop the bleeding,

Now we all fall for the bad ones,
Who just break us cause we're so young,
Dumb and vaunrable,
Young and vaunrable,

Here's a toast to the lucky ones,
To the girl that just broke my heart,
I can't breathe,
After all that you told me,
You took my heart and made me melt, again,

You ripped out all these pages,
Our book was overrated,
This brings up all these questions to me,
What just happened?
I'll say,

I put your picture in a frame,
That stands at the side of my bed,
So whenever I get sad,
I can stare at you're face,
Your overplayed and I won't forget,

When all I remember is talking,
Is cheap and you're lies were expensive,
And God only knows when I'll come to my senses,
Now I can't breathe at all,
Here's a toast to the lucky ones,
To the girl that just broke my heart.

You ripped out all these pages, (I can't breathe)
Our book was overrated, (after all that you told me)
This brings up all these questions
(You took my heart and made me melt again)

You ripped out all these pages, (I can't breathe)
Our book was overrated, (after all that you told me)
This brings up all these questions
(You took my heart and made me melt again)
Tell me what just happened?
