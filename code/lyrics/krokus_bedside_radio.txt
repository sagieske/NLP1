Song:

The show is over you got to go home again
Late in the night you're dreamin' of the guitar man
The radio station plays his latest song
It says your way of life is kinda wrong

Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio

You wake up early in the morning to the radio news
But in your blood is still this dose of blues, yeah
The sound of the band has turned you upside down
Instead of going to the office you're leavin' town

Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio

Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio

Turn it on
Turn it on
Turn it on
