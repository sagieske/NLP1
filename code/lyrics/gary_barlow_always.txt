Song:

From 'open road' album.
I have been living
I have been fooled
I have been many things but I've always been in love with you
I have been travelling
Eating life's food
Though I've been far away
I have still remained in love with you

I've been given a chance to share my music with the world
Soon my song will be over
'till I sing the song of love
For me and you
I've been sharing with the world my songs of love

Well baby I have been learning
I have been used
I have been sheltering within this plenty world of love I share with you

I've been given the answer
I've been given words of love
I've been given the reason
And the reason I've been sharing with the world
I've been sharing with the world my songs of love
That's why I'll always be in love
I will always be in love
I will always be in love with you
Always be in love
I will always be in love
I will always be in love with you
