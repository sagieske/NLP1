Song:

Alone you wake-up
Tasty feeling
Here is waiting...
What belongs it might be erased
Today is still briefing out
I will be waiting
And if you change what you are
God, I can't

Oooh, you captured it all good
You make me weak
And ooooh, you captured it awful
You make me...

I belong to you and all my sins
And maybe that's the reason
I belong to you and all our sins
And I don't regret it
One step 'til the end of the world
... You're faster than a bullet
One step to the edge of the world and...
You're faster than a bullet

Tell me is it real or is it fake?
Even what you were, I can't mistake
... And I know there is
All the... I walked with you
And what we said
All the lies you're telling them
I'm a lonely sin as you and me
It could be what it may
2 steps to the edge of the world
And it makes it better
I will listen
One step closer to the edge of the world
And I won't admit it
One step closer to the edge of the world
And I won't admit it
Faster than a bullet
One step closer to the edge of the world
And I won't admit it
Faster than a bullet
One step closer to the edge of the world
And I won't admit it
Faster than a bullet
One step closer to the edge of the world
And I won't admit it
But we did it
Faster than a bullet
