Song:

I've been up for days,
Trying to find a way to write this confession down.
Seems every line I writes a mess,
At least this I'll admit.
For what I've done I am not proud
But there's no need to pretend
No need for innocence
I've got to be honest now.

My verdict has come in,
It says I'm guilty for my sins this time.
I thought I could escape,
But then I finally felt the weight,
Of my crimes.
It's passion, it's not love,
Infatuation never ends up right.
At least I won't be alone tonight.

Cause I don't want to be alone tonight.

The prosecution rests,
With convincing evidence.
Well it seems I've been deceived.
So now I stand alone and wait for the first stone,
To be cast upon me.

My verdict has come in,
It says I'm guilty for my sins this time.
I thought I could escape,
But then I finally felt the weight of my crimes.
It's is passion, it's not love,
Infatuation never ends up right.
At least I won't be alone tonight.

At least I won't be alone tonight.
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight.
