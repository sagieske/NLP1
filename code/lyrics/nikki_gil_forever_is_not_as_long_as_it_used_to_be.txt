Song:

How can you say the feeling's gone
How can you tell me that we're no longer one

How can you say you've been untrue
Can you imagine the pain that I'm going through

You used to tell me your heart would be mine
Till the end of the world, till the end of all time

You said that we'd always be together
You said that you'd never stop loving me
You said a lifetime was what you were after
I guess forever is not as long as it used to be

How will I tell you that I'm still yours
How will I stop you from walking out my door

How can you say you're not coming back
Can you imagine how much i'll miss your love

Oh, where did I go wrong
All your emotions were so strong
I thought that they would last
I never thought your love for me
Would fade so fast

You said that we'd always be together
You said that you'd never set me free
You said we'd always care for each other
I guess forever is not as long as it used to be

You said that we'd always be together
You said that you'd never stop loving me
You said a lifetime was what you were after
I guess forever is not as long as it used to be
The feeling is not as strong as it used to be
Forever is not as long as it used to be
