Song:

My baby's got this set of jet black eyes
I swear that's girl's a devil in disguise
I've been let down, burned out
So let me tell you what I'm talking about
I've been chastised, deprived
She's got my skull filled with sentimental lies

[Chorus:]
She's no good for me
So I'm gonna let her free
I'm gonna let you fly
Bye, bye, so long, my sweet baby
Me, my love
Blame it on me
Me, my love
Say it was me now
Me, my love
Step back, don't jack me up now
Please, my love
Blame it on me

My girl she's got this jet-black hair
When she walks, head stops, rotate and stare
I've been let down locked out
So let me tell you what's she's all about
There's black lies, fake cries
She's got this bag filled with sentimental lies

[Chorus:]

Hey I know I'm wrong
So I'll go home
Make me believe
Me, my love
Blame it on me
Me, my love
Say it was me now
Me, my love
Step back, don't jack me up now
Please my love
