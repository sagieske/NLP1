Song:

Once before the world began
God was sitting in the sky
He began to get some mud together
O I wonder why

First he made a man
And then he made a woman
Mr. Adam and miss Eve
They began to be quite good friends
As I can well believe

O remember that morning
Remember that time
Take a warning
When you see the sign

Eve was sitting in the garden
When in came a serpent
Miss Eve take this apple
Give it to your man
Give it to your man
I don't want it
O Adam give it a try
O give it a try

Friends if you're travelling
Never go taking an apple from a snake
If you do I'll tell you true
You make a big mistake
