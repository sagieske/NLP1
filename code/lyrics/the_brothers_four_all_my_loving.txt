Song:

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling, I'll be true

- Instrumental ---

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, All my loving
I will send to you

All my loving
Darling, I'll be true...
