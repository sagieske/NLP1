Song:

I'm sifting through memories
Looking for answers in the past
A dose of reality
I hate the taste
But I know it's for the best

Connecting dotted lines
Taking steps to find
A way to fix myself
I try to redefine
All the things that hold me back
Out of this mess

I think I slept right through the good part
But somehow I'm still tired
I know it's time to make a new start
I can't seem to find a way
To walk out of my head
I'm afraid of what I'd miss
I think I slept right through the good part
So here's to dreaming out loud

It's like I've seen everything
But I can't remember when
Took more pictures than memories
I wonder if I was ever there at all

Connecting dotted lines
Taking steps to find
A way to fix myself
I try to redefine
All the things that hold me back
Out of this mess

I think I slept right through the good part
But somehow I'm still tired
I know it's time to make a new start
I can't seem to find a way
To walk out of my head
I'm afraid of what I'd miss
I think I slept right through the good part
So here's to dreaming out loud

Here's to dreaming out loud
Oh, I'm just dreaming

I think I slept right through the good part
But somehow I'm still tired
I know it's time to make a new start
I can't seem to find a way
To walk out of my head
I'm afraid of what I'd miss
I think I slept right through the good part
So here's to dreaming out loud

Here's to dreaming out loud
Here's toâ€¦
Here's to dreaming out loud
