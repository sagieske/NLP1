Song:

Now's the time
To rearrange your life
Live for something
Outside of your own mind
We all dream
The same dream everynight
To burn the world that you call civilized
Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
I'll never understand
The who, what, why or when
Of you tonight...
We face the stares of judgement
And almost everyday
The shaking heads of disapproval say,
"pray for you to give me something then find out that there was nothing left"
Recite the words inside (your heart)
Realize that this is nothing
Without your voice
I'm not giving up
And i'll blame the worst on you
I know what's wrong
Alive and well
I live to be alive
I live to always strive
For something more
Alive and well
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
And I don't need to explain
Myself to you
