Song:

Did I hear you say, whatever?
Turn and walk away, forever?
Was it my mistake, or did we just get too close?
Until we meet again I think you better learn to...

Live, for the sake of livin'.
Love, til' your heart is breakin'.
Give your all and don't hold back.
Tell the truth and don't forget to,
Laugh til' your body's acken.
Cry til' your hands are shakin'.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
Don't live, a whatever life.

Bet ya think it's cool, to never,
Care about the things, that matter.
Was it just a dream, or did we feel something real?
You'll be all alone, until you finally start to...

Live, for the sake of livin'.
Love, til' your heart is breakin'.
Give your all and don't hold back.
Tell the truth and don't forget to,
Laugh til' your body's acken.
Cry til' your hands are shakin'.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
Don't live, a whatever life.

I'm all done, waiting.
I'm movin' on.
I'm ready to be strong,
And....

Live, for the sake of livin'.
Love, til' your heart is breakin'.
Give your all and don't hold back.
Tell the truth and don't forget to,
Laugh til' your body's acken.
Cry til' your hands are shakin'.
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
Don't live, a whatever life.

Live, for the sake of livin'.
Love, til' your heart is breakin'. (a whatever life)
Give your all and don't hold back.
Tell the truth and don't forget to,
Laugh til' your body's acken.
Cry til' your hands are shakin'. (a whatever li-e-ife)
Wherever you go, whatever you do,
Don't live, a whatever life.

Live, for the sake of livin'.
Love, til' your heart is breakin'. (a whatever life)
Give your all and don't hold back.
