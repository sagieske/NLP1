Song:

I Don't Know How To Love Him
What to do how to move him
I've been changed yes really changed
In these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else

I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man he's just a man
And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more

Should I bring him down should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love let my feelings out
I never thought I'd come to this -- what's it all about

Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so

I never thought I'd come to this -- what's it all about
Yet if he said he loved me
I'd be lost I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him so
