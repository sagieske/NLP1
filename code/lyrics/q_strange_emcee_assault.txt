Send* corrections to the typist [Verse

]:Assaulting
emcee's with my lyrical artillery You
sicken me the epitome of lyrical wizardry Ability
for spitten' these rhymes without no sympathy Verbally
assaulting emcee's they should imprison me Given
me electrocution, cookin' me like Quickasee? The?
should call you emcee social studies cuz you history Mystery
why punk a kids** wanna mess wit me Infecting
me with deafening music it is upsetting me (I
got) punch lines like people at the prom waitin' for juice You
got whack rhymes use the mic cord as a noose I'm
sorta confused cuz, I thought I saw on the news That
there's an epidemic spreading and they caught it from you It's
whack rapper disease and it affects punk emcees You
beating me is like black folks on ski's You'll
never see it kid not, even in your dreams I
need skills like Carson Daily needs screamin' teens [Chorus

repeat: 2X] Step
up if you wanna get hurt Comin'
wit the grime and the grit and the dirt Step
up if you wanna get hurt Emcee
Assault [Verse

2 ]:I
talk trash so cats wanna battle me now Well
ain't cute no more just, like Little Bow Wow A
fowl mouth assaulting, emcee's stompin'em out Talkin'
more garbage than Oscar the grouch I'm
knockin'em out like, fish you be floppin' around Paramedics
are jetting you to the hospital now Choppin'em
down like, a lumberjack wit an ax All
that's left is puddles of blood with kangols and backpacks Whipen'em
out like, some boogies on a snot rag Thugs
be boys nerd, emcee's and even art fags Not
sad I'm, happy like Gilmore I'm
I'll raw funky, fresh, deaf, and still more I'm
real poor only, chips I'm stackin' is my Pringles Punch
bachelors so I can say I have hit singles I
mix-mingle try, to lead fellow musicians But
I'm driven by the competition then I start to dissin' I'm
trippin' like, jack trippa I'm surrounded by broads You
think you get raw (Come?and knock on my door) I'm
not on a tour if, you wanna see me perform Ya
gotta come to my crib sit wit my kid on the floor [Chorus

]:[Verse

3 ]:I'm
dirty like an aids infested hypodermic needle Gritty
like the sand in the speedo of a fag gweedo Grimy
like a slimy reptiley creature Even
if I lost my speech I, would still beat'cha Stumbling
and, mumbling make ya words clearer Ya
strugglin' worse than Big Pun's Pallbearers My
rhymes are more grimy than ya grandma's a In**
the heat for three weeks without havin' a bath And
havin' attacks of, uncontrollable gas Wit
a mess in her Depends and grandpas nut blast Step
to me I, got them rhymes straight out the gutter It's
embaracin' like goin' to the mall wit cha mother And
ya handicapped father and ya retarded brotha Why
bother battlin' me go find anotha Rhymes
to steal tagged on the wall of a men's room stall You
a victim of Emcee Assault [Chorus!
