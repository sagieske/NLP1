Song:

Everybody needs inspiration, 
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the nights so long

Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy... 

Yea when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I... 
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I... 
I look at you

When I look At You I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars Hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I Know I'm Not Alone.

Yea when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I... 
I look at you

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I... 
I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like Kaleidoscope colors that
Prove Me, All I need every
Breath that I breathe don't you know
You're beautiful... 

Yea Yea Yea

When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I... 
I look at you
I look at you

Yea Yea Oh OH OH

And you appear Just like a dream
To me.
