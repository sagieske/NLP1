Song:

Baby I got love for thee
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby, baby, baby

(Baby I) ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby

Baby I'm so down for you
No matter what you do, (real talk), I'll be around
Oh baby
See baby I been feelin' you
Before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh baby

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what (I'm feeling)
And I say baby baby, baby

(Baby I) ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby

Straight up, you got me,
All in, how could I not be,
I sure hope you know
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than the word love can say it
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep sayingâ€¦ Baby I

Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby
Baby
Baby, baby

(Baby I) ooh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby I) ooh baby, baby I
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it
Words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
