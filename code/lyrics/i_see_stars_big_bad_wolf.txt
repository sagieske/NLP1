Song:

Stop and save your voice girl
You're the only one that has control, so choose

I don't know what to say to you
The answer's out there,
I'm just putting this out there
That it's your turn here pretending you care

I understand the way you move and the things you do
If you could just tell the truth maybe I could be with you

Stop and save your voice girl
You're the only one that has control, so choose
We are the movies, snap fingers and we're on a floating carpet
Scoot through the scenes, we are invisible for now

I'm the big bad wolf
See the pigs, they run in horror
Don't build your house out of grass
Or I'll blow you away

Stop and save your voice girl
You're the only one that has control, so choose

I'm not gonna let you get to my head
Can you please stop listening?
I have just stopped listening

I understand the way you move and the things you do
If you could just tell the truth maybe I could be with you

Only in the movies can you see the creatures in front of us
There's no stopping them, there's no stopping them

Stop and save your voice girl
You're the only one that has control, so choose
We are the movies, snap fingers and we're on a floating carpet
Scoot through the scenes, we are invisible for now

Cut the tall trees
What have hath God to wraught?
You complicate my notion
I've seen the future
And it's not too bright
