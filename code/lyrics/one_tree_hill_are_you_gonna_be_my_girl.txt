Song:

So 1, 2, 3, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
And I really wanna make you mine.

I say you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine.

Oh, 4, 5, 6 c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
When you look like that, do ya honey.

Big black boots, 
Long brown hair, 
She's so sweet
With her get back stare.

Well I could see, 
You home with me, 
But you were with another man, yea! 
I know we, 
Ain't got much to say, 
Before I let you get away, yea! 
I said, are you gonna be my girl?

Well, so 1, 2, 3, take my hand and come with me
Because you look so fine
And I really wanna make you mine.

I say you look so fine
That I really wanna make you mine.

Oh, 4, 5, 6 c'mon and get your kicks
Now you don't need that money
With a face like that, do ya.

Big black boots, 
Long brown hair, 
She's so sweet
With her get back stare.

Well I could see, 
You home with me, 
But you were with another man, yea! 
I know we, 
Ain't got much to say, 
Before I let you get away, yea! 
I said, are you gonna be my girl?

Oh yea. Oh yea. C'mon! 
I could see, 
You home with me, 
But you were with another man, yea! 
I know we, 
Ain't got much to say, 
Before I let you get away, yea! 
Uh, be my girl.
Be my girl.
Are you gonna be my girl! Yea
