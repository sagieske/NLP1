Song:

This place reminds me of,
A time that's way too old.
These thoughts have gathered up the memories unfold.
But for now I don't see what's so wrong with pretending
It's true I thought you knew.

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime.
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her it's all she's got it's all she's got.
It's all she's got, it's all she's got.

These days keep getting worse I'm wasting all my time.
I thought I'd come in first, instead I fell behind.
I don't know, I don't know if I can keep this up to long.
It seems most every time my motives are all wrong
But for now I don't see what's so wrong with pretending
It's true I thought you knew.

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime.
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her it's all she's got it's all she's got.

It's times like this, but time's run out
It's times like this, but time's run out
It's times like this, but time's run out
It's times like this, I want to,

Believe her, it's all she's got to pass the time
Believe her, it's over now she's passed her prime.
Believe her, it's all she's got to keep things right
Believe her it's all she's got it's all she's got.
