Song:

I turned on the tv war news
Just to look and wonder why
Thunder crashed and red flash-flowers
Bloomed a nightmare in the sky
So I went down to the cafe
Just to string myself along
On the way I found some riches --
Played the jukebox, got this song
While I sat there a ragged man came --
Bummed a coffee, talked awhile
Told me stories full of wonder --
Left me laughing like a well-loved child
