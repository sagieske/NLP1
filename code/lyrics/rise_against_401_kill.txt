Song:

As I watch your life go up in flames
You'll swear up and down you'd like to change
But when the sun sinks slowly into the sky
Now you're right where you started again
With nothing to say
Without an argument or case

And when it's said and done
And done and said
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes
Inside your eyes!

When will you stop and realize the worth and value of your life?
As you suffocate yourself within this mindless 9-5
Wake up!
There's more!
And your life is nobody's but yours
And now it's said and done
And done and said
And now what's another day?

I can feel these changes right before my eyes
I see a dying fire inside your eyes

You're running circles around my slow pace
You've reached the finish line
Only to realize there was no race
I'm sick of being stepped on for the things I choose
I give and take and now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could
And now I've taken all I could (I've taken, I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could (I've taken, I've taken)
And now I've taken all I could
