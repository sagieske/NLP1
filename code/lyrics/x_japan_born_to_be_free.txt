Song:

Touch the stream an ember ray
Seize the light and don't let the falcon find you
Close your eyes and see the sight
Where the sun be free to shine

Chorus:
Born to be free (free forever)
Born to be free (now and forever)
Nobody can steal (steal the freedom)
Our life away(they will not sever)
Born to be free (free forever)
I want to be free (we won't surrender)
We'll be forever free to love

Cut the leash fulfilling death
Try to hide and try not to die!
Into the shadow the butterfly
Where your heart will fill to fly

Chorus:
Born to be free (free forever)
Born to be free (now and forever)
Nobody can steal (steal the freedom)
Our life away(they will not sever)
Born to be free (free forever)
I want to be free (we won't surrender)

We'll be forever free to love

"Just believe in love
Breathe in life
You'll seize the world of difference
You'll cross the line... It's endless
As if destiny has it's own mind
It's love covers mine with blindness
It's hatred cuts through the skin of shallowness
But I wont run
I will rule"

Born to be free
Born to be free
Nobody can steal
Our life away
Born to be free
Born to be free
We'll be forever
We're free to love

Chorus:
Born to be free (free forever)
Born to be free (now and forever)
Nobody can steal (steal the freedom)
Our life away(they will not sever)
Born to be free (free forever)
I want to be free (we won't surrender)
We'll be forever free to love
