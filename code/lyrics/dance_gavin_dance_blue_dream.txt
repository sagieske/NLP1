Song:

Let's start it over as I comb back and forth
Through the causes of my mistakes
Well you said it over and over
Don't come back don't come around my kids
Well I'm already in, in your home

Give in, give in, give it all, slow it down (x4)

You'll go far on the back of a potato
Making French fries in the snow
Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow
You'll be red, You'll be gold
Then you'll steal (x3)

Then you're right in sah dah getti fah da getti tah the betti tah righ (x2)

Smooth out the street, move your feet
Let it out, let it out, let it out
Place the blame on my head
Let it out, let it out, give it all

Give in, give in, give it all, slow it down (x4)

You'll go far on the back of a potato
Making French fries in the snow
Then you'll steal, then you'll borrow
You'll be red, You'll be gold
Then you'll steal (x3)

Then you're right in sah dah getti fah da getti tah the betti tah righ (x2)

Stop, let it go under now
Doo doo doo doo doo
Don't move baby stay put

I don't know what I'd do if I ever lost you too. Hey! (x6)

Hey I'm bumping bleedo blee blee doe
