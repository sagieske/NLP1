Song:

We were born to fight!

Here I stand, my breath is baited waiting for the clouds to burst. I plead and scream, "Come what may!"

Dear God, lift me up from this ground of pain
The heat has reached a degree that's bringing me to faint
My faith and sweat have remained to contend the grave
Despite the sting, we're waiting until you bring our fate

We're singing!
[Chorus:]
We are the children of fire!
We are the lions!
We stayed when all else deserted!
Cuz we were born to fight and fight and fight!

I see you, tattered and bruised
You're the only ones who remained true
I hear your call through the thick of it all
You've waited so long for the rescue
Our time has come!

I'm sweating red, I'm sweating red, I'm sweating red
I'm red, I'm sweating red, I'm sweating red, red, red
I'm sweating red, I'm sweating red, I'm red
I'm sweating red, I'm sweating red red red

It turns from blue
The sky comes unglued
And falls to the earth as my answer
It's so far from rain, the lot will feel pain
As it singes their skin but for you it will soothe

What descends feels like heaven on my skin
Finally I am free to never breath again
My body lifts from the ground I was rooted in
And I pass the spark as it races to the rest of them

[Chorus: X2]

Ignite ignite ignite world
Ignite ignite ignite the world
Ignite ignite ignite the world
Ignite the world and let it burn!
