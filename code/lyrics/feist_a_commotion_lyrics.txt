Song:

He flicker to light, 
He turned broke what was right
He got the roots by the hair
When it was no longer there

He blocked out the sun
He climbed up the stairs
Through the cross
I went marching my back
A commotion, a commotion
A commotion, a commotion

If it rips you all apart
Then glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
And glad you're still at your heart

Stop through the rooms
Until she's all back
If it puts out the shells
It turns half way to hell
Then he held me down tight
Took all my fight
Broke down the windows
You came flying down the 
A commotion, a commotion
A commotion, a commotion

If it rips you all apart
Then glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
And glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
Then glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
And glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
Then glad you're still at your heart
If it rips you all apart
And glad you're still at your heart.
