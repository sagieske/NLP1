Song:

Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now youre talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
Imma do it acapella (x2)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said get a rich boyfriend
You dont gotta love em, girl, you can pretend
You better totes believed her, yeah, every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread
Mama always said nice guys finish last
Beat em at his own game, honey, take the cash

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, and what a lucky girl you will be
But no, he didnt do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic aint right, time to walk

[Chorus]
Used to be your baby, used to be lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now youre talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
Imma do it acapella, yeah

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Imma do it acapella, yeah

[Verse 2]
Out on our first date, he took me gourmet
We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy
Daddy always said let the gentleman pay
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet
I saw his bad intention, he didnt wanna talk
He put the saucy on it (Oops! ) time to check my wallet
Daddy always said money cant buy class
You dont wanna get stuck taking out trash

[Pre-Chorus - variation]
Ooh, yeah I guess it wasnt meant to be
Because he didnt do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic aint right, time to walk

[Chorus]
Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now youre talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
Imma do it acapella, yeah

[Middle 8]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Imma do it acapella
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me do it in falsett-uh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Never mind, bring the beat back

[Chorus]
Used to be your baby, used to be you lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now youre talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it solo
Imma do it acapella, yeah

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Imma do it acapella, yeah
