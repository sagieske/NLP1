Song:

Alone, twenty millions years from my place.
A slide, on the starlight.
Watch out, a new planet right on my trail!
The space, oh oh it's mine!
Oh oh!

I'm lost, in an infinite night trip.
The sun, could make me blind.
I wish, I could bring a girl to my ship.
And fly, her hand in mine!
Oh oh!

Alone, twenty million years from my place
(Is the dream over?)
The space, oh oh it's mine!
