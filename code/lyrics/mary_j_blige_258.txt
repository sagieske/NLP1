Song:

I can love you with my eyes closed
I see your heart through a blind fold
I ain't never ever met another better
So my baby ain't no way that I'ma let go
From the north to the south pole
From the east to the west coast
Wherever you go, all over the globe
Ain't no way on the planet you can go that I won't

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around,
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8, 25/8

You ain't gotta worry about me, no
Ain't no question at my loyalty
You been there for me, even when nobody
Cared enough to check and see if I was breathing
See don't nobody really know me, know me
You and me, we got history
So I give you a part
For loving me boy, put your hand in my hand
I'll lead the way out

From sun up to sun down
I'll always be around,
Every minute of every hour
Still it ain't enough time

Cause I got days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8,

Ain't nobody give me love, give me love
Like I need
See I love the way you make me smile
When things ain't going right
You know how to hold me tight
Can make pain go away, yeah

Every day baby, every night baby
On the week day, on any day
On every day, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out
Every day baby, every night baby
On the week day, on any day
On every day, I'm alive baby
I'ma love you, help me sing it out

Days and days and days of love, for you boy
And I don't wanna have to rush
But 24/7 ain't enough
Cause I got so much love for you boy
I need another hour and a day
So I can love you 25/8...
