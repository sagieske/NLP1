Song:

I dream of you draped in wires
And leaning on the breaks
As I leave you with restless liars and dealers on the take.
And I can read you like a gun
You watched this meeting hall sweat and shake!
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you all on.
I'll take you on.
Oh, I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
And strike you with desire of fault lines
No clutch, No storm.
I can bind you with no ties and leash, and watch you fall.
You see I've got this soul it's all fired up
This soul it's all fired up
This soul, I got this soul
It's all fired up
this soul, it's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
I teach you of death's desires
Reflecting in lakes,
As I lead you in fearful file to a precipitous fate.
And I welcome you,
I welcome your sweethearts that bleed and break.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you all on.
I'll take you on when your will is gone.
I'll take you on.
I'll take you on.
I will strike you with desire of fault lines
No clutch, No storm.
I can bind you with no ties and lease time and watch you fall.
See, I've got this soul it's all fired up
This soul, I got this soul
It's all fired up
this soul, it's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
all fired up
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
