Song:

I look at you and you look at me
trying not to want what can't be
you're with my friend
And she holds your hand
Wasn't that supposed to be be me

Chorus

Oh baby I can't get you outta my mind
I don't know why you came into my life
I can't get you outta my mind honest I try
You're there all the time

She never said and I never asked
how was I to know you weren't free
she spoke of you but I never knew
That the other woman was me

Oh baby I can't get you outta my mind
I don't know why you came into my life
I can't get you outta my mind
honest I try you're there all the time

Each time I see her now I think of you
I don't what I'm gonna do
I look into the eyes of someone new
and there reflected is my love for you

Chorus
