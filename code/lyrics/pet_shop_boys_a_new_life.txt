(Lowe/Springs/Tennant)
-------------
At night it hits me cold
There's so much more to life than I'll ever know
I look around and I realise
It's time to make a move, though you won't sympathise

Stars collect overhead
They look down on the channel and our lives grown dead
Cars pass on through the night
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another heart in a different scene

Make a firm decision, it's time to go
That's for you to find out and for me to know
No more hard times or petty crimes
Forget that life I have left behind

The night goes by
Leaving you behind me, as I fly
Then rise, the day and night sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another heart in a different scene

A new life, it's so hard to find
A new love, it's so hard to find

The night goes by
Leaving you behind me, as I fly
There lies the day in that sky
How do you get to heaven if you never try?

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another heart in a different scene

New life, new love
Where's the heart I was dreaming of?
I need a new hope, new dream
Another heart in a different scene
