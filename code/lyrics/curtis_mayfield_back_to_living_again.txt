Song:

Now it's always the right time
With somethin' positive in your mind
There's always someone to pull you down
You just get that work and hold your ground

If there's ever somethin' bad you don't wanna see
Just keep on walkin' and let it be
I don't wanna hear 'bout all that's bad, no, no
'Cause all that's bad just makes me sad

So every little once in a while
Show some love and make me smile
Cry sometimes with tears of joy, oh yeah
Sure would help now where they fall, say yeah

Summer, winter or just cold
Through the rain and through the snow
Let's get on back to livin' again, right on
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back

Wherever life takes me I don't know, hey
Just give me a truth and let me grow, ooh
I have these feelings in myself, hey
I am sure there must be someone else

Shootin' guns in prison life
Is that what you want, well, Jesus Christ?
It's best for you to get back on track
There ain't no need in lookin' back, don't look back

So you're tryin' hard, well, try again
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
Just remember by and by, just remember
It's best to keep a lateral high

So summer, winter or just cold
Through the rain and through the snow, yeah
Let's get on back to livin' again, right on
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back

If you're feelin' inferior, hey
Make yourself superior
If you practice, baby, all the time
No one can think what's on your mind

Tossin' and fightin' all the time
Do you really want some peace of mind? Yeah
Remember back as a little kid
There was so much fun in what we did

Summer, winter or just cold, here we go
Through the rain and through the snow
Let's get on back to livin' again
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back

Summer, winter or just cold
Through the rain and through the snow
Let's get on back to livin' again
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back

Let's get on back to livin' again, right on
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back

Let's get on back to livin' again, right on
Just get on back to livin' again
Get on back, get on back
Let's get on back to livin' again, right on

Go ahead Mayfield
