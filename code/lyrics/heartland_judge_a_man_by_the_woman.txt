Song:

Some judge a man by the way he shakes a hand
And if he looks a man in the eyes
By the way he treats his tools
The way he treats a fool
And the things that he can buy
His shoes, how they shine
All that I admit

I judge a man by the woman
And her smile, the light in her eyes
The way she holds him when they dance
She's the window to his soul
His best friend, don't you know
You judge the day by the sun
But you judge a man by the woman

You can spend all day watching work and play
Get to know his habits and his friends
Learn what makes him laugh, pry into his past
Find out what makes him cry and makes him sin
You might think you can right through
Oh, but the best thing you can do

Is judge a man by the woman
And her smile, the light in her eyes
The way she holds him when they dance
She's the window to his soul
His best friend, don't you know
You judge the day by the sun
But you judge a man by the woman

[Instrumental Interlude]

Judge a man by the woman
And her smile or the light in her eyes
The way she holds him when they dance
She's the window to his soul
His best friend, don't you know
You judge the day by the sun
But you judge a man by the woman
You judge a man by the woman
