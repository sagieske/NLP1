Song:

Don't get me started on the things that I've been hearing.
You have forgotten the face of your father and now you have been disgraced.

You say I got to wear a tie to church, 
And I can only get to Heaven through my works, 
I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

I bet you're gonna say this song is offensive, 
A little over the top and abrasive, 
If that is what it takes to wake you up, 
Sign me up.

I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy
Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

I, I hate you too, I love you too
I hate you too
I love you too! 
I hate you too

Here we go.

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy
Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy
