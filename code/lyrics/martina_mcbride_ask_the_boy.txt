Song:

Ask the boy 
The one who fell in love with me 
If he'll come back tonight 

'Cause he's the boy 
The one who always made me laugh 
Yeah where is he tonight 

And I'll ask the girl 
The one who wasn't complicated 
If she'll trade me places for a while 

Let's forget the rules and just let go 
And drink it all in 
Kiss under the stars we used to know 
If they're still shinin' 
I'm up for anything 
Just waitin' on you 
To ask the boy 

Ask the boy 
Who built his world around me 
If I still light up his eyes 

'Cause I can't forget 
He put his arms around me 
And we stayed like that all night 

Let's stay like that 
Let's stay like that 

Let's forget the rules and just let go 
And drink it all in 
Kiss under the stars we used to know 
If they're still shinin' 
I'm up for anything 
Just waitin' on you 
To ask the boy 

I'm waitin' 
Ask the boy 
I'm waitin' 
Ask the boy 

Let's stay like that 
Let's stay like that 

Let's forget the rules and just let go 
Drink it all in 
Kiss under the stars we used to know 
If they're still shinin' 
I'm up for anything 
Just waitin' on you 
To ask the boy 

I'm waitin' 
Ask the boy 
I'm waitin' 
Ask the boy 

Ask the boy 
The one who fell in love with me 
If he'll come back tonight
