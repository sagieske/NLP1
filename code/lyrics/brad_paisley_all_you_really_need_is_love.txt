Song:

(Brad Paisley/Chris Dubois/Frank Rogers)

So you say you wanna tie the knot
And you're askin' me if I think that the two of you have got
What it takes to make it work
Well one thing's for sure
All you really need is love

Let me say I'm happy for you both
And here's a little something that the two of you should know
If you want to do it right
Just take my advice
All you really need is love

And a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations
A minister, a white dress, and of course a congregation
And flowers and music and candles and cake
And a bunch of rice for folks to throw as you drive away

Now what's that expression on your face
You're lookin' kind of pale, is everything ok
Don't worry you'll be fine
If you just keep in mind
All you really need is love

And bridesmaids and groomsmen and a wedding coordinator
And food for the reception, you'll need someone to cater
Did I forget to mention it'll take a couple rings
And of course a P. A. System if you're wantin' me to sing

Now you look so happy you could cry
And that explains the tear drops I see wellin' in your eyes
Don't worry you'll be fine
If you just keep in mind
All you really need is love

I'm sure I'm tellin' you something you already knew
All you really need is love
