Song:

I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
And I like the way you needed me
Every time things got rocky

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you say
Do you say what you mean
I want our love to last forever

But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
And have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I like the way you'd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you'd say my name
In the middle of the night
While you were sleeping

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever
Well I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
And have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

Your would run around and lead me on forever
Oh while I wait at home still thinking we're together
I wanted our love to last forever

I was believing in you

I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
And have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

I'd rather hear the truth
And have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

But baby don't you break my heart slow...
