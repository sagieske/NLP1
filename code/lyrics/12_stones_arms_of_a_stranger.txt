Song:

I came home early to see you
Couldn't wait to hold you
I've been away for so long

But as I walked through the doorway
My heart was shattered
To find that your not alone

When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

The days just seem so much longer
Now that I'm without you
It never seems to get better

I'll try to hold it together
And I can't wait for
The day that you fade from my memory

When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

In the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger

When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake

Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

When will I break
In the arms of a stranger
It's your mistake
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
In the arms of a stranger

I came home early to see you
Couldn't wait to hold you
Your in the arms of a stranger
