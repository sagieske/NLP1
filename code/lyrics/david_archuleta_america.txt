Song:

Every where around the world
They're coming to America
Every time the flag's unfurled
They're coming to America
Got a dream and take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America

They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming, to America
They're coming to America

(Today)
My country tis of thee
(Today)
Sweet land of liberty
(Today)
Of thee I see
(Today)
Of thee I see, today

(Today)
We've been traveling far
(Today)
Without a voice
(Today)
But not without a star

Let, freedom, ring
