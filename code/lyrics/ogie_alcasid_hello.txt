Song:

Hi, hello, its nice to see you again,
I didn't quite expect this..
I don't know what to say,
Seems so strange to see you standing there
Thought you left forever now you reappear
Yes I know its been a long long time
And yes we left on a sad one note
That let two has said goodbye
But here we are my heart beats once again..
Is this a new beginning what can I say
Well hello.....

Seems so strange to see you standing there
Thought you left forever now you reappear
Yes I know its been a long long time
And yes we left on a sad one note
That let two has said goodbye
But here we are my heart beats once again..
Is this a new beginning what can I say
Well hello..

Yes I know its been a long long time
And yes we left on a sad one note
That let two has said goodbye
But here we are my heart beats once again..
Is this a new beginning what can I say
Well hello.....
