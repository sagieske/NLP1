Song:

Little beads of light were dancin' off the wall
Reflectin' off the spinning crystal ball
In a dance hall down in Texas, where time slowed to a crawl
Baby, it's just you holdin' on to me in the middle of it all

Oh girl, you're the center of my world
That place in my universe
To me you're every dream I dream
The air I breathe, my everything
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world

My whole life changed the moment I met you
And here we are like Heaven only knew
There could be ten thousand people fillin' up this room
But in my mind, far as I'm concerned, it's just me and you

Oh girl, you're the center of my world
That place in my universe
To me you're every dream I dream
The air I breathe, my everything
A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world

A ray of sunlight shinin' down
The point my life revolves around
It's like I live to love you girl
You're the center of my world

You're the center of my world
That place in my universe
