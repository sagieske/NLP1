Song:

You aint nuthin but a dog
You aint nuthin but a dog
You aint nuthin but a dog
You aint nuthin but a dog
(a dog a dog a dog is a dog)

Now I don't know what it is
But I've had this problem since I was a little kid
Girls were drawn to me
You might be asking yourself how big a problem could that be
Check this out and peep this here yall
Me and this f-l-y guy got pitfalls
Cause I got it rough
Cause one girl for me ain't never been enough
And it seems that women can't handle when
Your paintbrush is for more than one canvas
But I gotta keep on painting like picasso going to the break of dawn
Now the way I play
The things I say
Never been a lie cause I ain't that type of guy
And that's why I get totally appalled
When females say I ain't nuthin but a dog

But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog

Back in high school this girl named Tracy
Yoused to do her best to disgrace me
She tried to destroy fp
She told all her friends I was a d-o-g
But yo I swear it was a misunderstanding
But she seemed to think that I planned it
She had this friend evette
That wanted to double date cause she was liking Jeff
But I showed up all alone
Told her that Jeff was sick back at home
I said I tried to call you
But we can still double date
Me plus your 2
She didn't get what the joke was all about
She smacked the tapes right out of my mouth
And with a huff and a puff walked off
And then tracy said he ain't nuthin but a dog

But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog

Dammit I ain't no dog and that's one of the names I refuse to be called
Cause that label just ain't fair yo
Look I'm a prince I'm supposed to have a herum
Well of course I like you
But I like her and that other girl too
What do you mean I'm just like them other singers
Look I don't see no rings on this fingers
I ain't ready to settle down quite yet
I wanna carve my name on the night set
I want shoe boxes with hundreds of love notes
I want my phone to ring till it's broke
I want a dance and prance in italy
And girls in egypt thinking just of me
I wanna be in the mix that's all
But I guess to you I ain't nuthin but a dog

But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog

Look baby can I rap to you for a second
I just wanna talk to you
I wanna know why I gotta be a dog
Why d-o-g gotta refer to me
Look baby I'm 21 years old
You know I'm making a little bit of money
I'm just trying to see the world and have some fun
You know... okay yes I do have a lot of friends (dog)
Well associates I like to think of them as creative date associates you know
Evette is my associate Donna's my associate I'm just trying to enjoy myself
Why do you keep calling me a dog
Oh I'm a dog (dog)
I'm a dog right
Okay well um ruff ruff

You ain't nuthin but a dog

(I've never had a dog)
(I'm not a dog)
(I've never had a dog)
(I'm not a dog)
(I've never had a dog)
(I'm not a dog)

But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
You ain't nuthin but a dog
