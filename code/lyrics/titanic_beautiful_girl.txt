Song:

I knew you so long, I knew you so well
I couldn't believe you went through a hell
He said that he loves you, he meant that he owns you
The way that he treats you is not what you deserve.

Beautiful girl, go your own way
Beautiful girl, don't care what they say
Living your life is all you should see
Take care of yourself

You always have told me that you love him too
Inspite of the things he is doing to you
You now must decide if you keep on being quiet
Or reach out to be a girl who is free

Beautiful girl, go your own way
Beautiful girl, don't care what they say
Living your life is all you should see
Take care of yourself
Beautiful girl, go your own way
Beautiful girl, don't care what they say
Living your life is all you should see
Take care of yourself
Beautiful girl......
