Song:

Ughh! Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack... Ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack... Yeah!
It goes a-one, two three and
It's just another bombtrack
And suckas be thinkin that they can fake this
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk hos that
Think they run the game
But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall
And the businesses that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality
Enough
I call the bluff
For manifest destiny

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch em burn

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Yes ya gonna burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

It goes a-one, two, three
Another fuckin radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

With the thoughts from a militant, militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch em burn

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Yes ya gonna burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

Euurrrggghhhhh!
Uggh! Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...
Check it out...

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Yes ya gonna burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

Burn!
