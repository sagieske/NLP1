Song:

Who can stand next to Your majesty?
Next to Your holiness, who can stand?
What compares, faced with Your righteousness?
Faced with Your promises, what compares?
Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing

Chorus:
Holy are You, Lord
King of all glory, we have come to honor You
Holy are You, Lord
Heaven and earth ring, singing Hallelujah

Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing
Here we are, by Your grace we stand
Matchless King, we've come to sing

Chorus:
Holy are You, Lord
King of all glory, we have come to honor You
Holy are You, Lord
Heaven and earth ring, singing Hallelujah
