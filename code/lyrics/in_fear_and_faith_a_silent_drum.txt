Song:

I pretend the only reason I am here is to be the one that you endear
Grab a hold of what you fear, and erase it all

Oh mother, the world is wearing down and you're the only thing I need
The only reason I can even keep my head below the clouds
Without you it's pointless, alone I am helpless
The air interrupted by the gases that we sow
I can barely recognize your face, oh how it use to glow
I cannot stand this fucking world

All alone here we are, I can feel your heart
As it beats a silent drum
Now my bodies going numb
This isn't our end
As long as you're near me
I'm seeing clearly now
Let's live like it's just us
We can make the best of the world that they left us

Now I'm the one you trust
In the age of disgust I can help you conquer anything
We'll accomplish everything that comes in the midst of the end of days
This is our time to persevere through the greatest evil known to man:
The governing hand

Don't let me die, don't let it crush me inside
I only trust what these eyes can see
Son just open up your eyes and look past those glowing skies
Just recall those times that are keeping us alive

All alone here we are, I can feel your heart
As it beats a silent drum
Now my bodies going numb
This isn't our end
As long as I'm near you
Nothing can tear you down
Let's live like it's just you and I
I can build us a home from what's left of our lives

Smoke fills my lungs as I awaken in this hell we call home
But the more I reminisce of yesterday
I find we only need each other, not a sister nor a brother

All alone here we are, I can feel your heart
As it beats a silent drum
Now my bodies going numb
All alone here we are, I can feel your heart
As it beats a silent drum
Now my bodies going numb
This isn't our end
As long as I'm near you
Nothing can tear you down
Let's live like it's just you and I
I can build us a home from what's left of our lives
