Song:

Solve me and all my problems
You call me
Late nights in Harlem
The street speaks
Like it's a starlet ghost

And always
Your throwing glances my way
You look at me like you could save me
You could you know

And oh look how you shine
I know I could love you if we tried
So try, try, try, try

I've been saving up for this moment
Spent too long in my own head
Now I'm breaking through

And always
I find I'm ending up sideways
It's two steps forward
And one way to get to you

And oh look how you shine
I know I could love you if we tried
So try, try, try, try

We left the dust to settle
Anywhere it wants to fall
Making patterns on the window
Leaving marks upon the wall

We spent our time in silence
But there's something you should know
That I would hold you like the wind
And I would catch you like the snow
(The snow)

So try, try, try, try
Try, try, try, try
