Song:

Honey, when you doubt my love for you
Look into my eyes what I’m going through
Even if we change and fall out of
You hold my hand and it’s better than love

Save me from myself
You got my back when I need help
It’s no one else in the world
You will always be my girl
You will always be, you will always be
You will always be my girl

Sometimes dreams they don’t come true
I was scared that night when I met you
Well, I stayed patient and I was kind
Telling you to take your time

Turn my life around
You made it okay to let you down
There’s no one else in the world
You will always be my girl
You will always be, you will always be
You will always be my girl

So when I’m walking down the road and feeling bad
Can’t understand the things you do
Nothing turns out the way we planned
You’re still my baby and I’m still your man

Save me from myself
You got my back when I need help
It’s no one else in the world
You will always be my girl
You will always be, you will always be
You will always be my girl
