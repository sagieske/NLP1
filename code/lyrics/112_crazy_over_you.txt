Song:

I fell in love with you,
Twas' like a dream come true,
And my love for you will never end, oh no.
It was such a special night.
You lay right by my side,
And I told you things I'd never tell a soul.
And now that I have you baby babe.
I promise I'll never leave (never leave).
Cause' you're the only one that makes my life complete.
And I'm...
Crazy over you, I don't know what to do,
I'm crazy over you,
Yeah oohh...
And I'm crazy over you,
I don't know what to do,
I'm crazy over you...
Ohh girl...
A love that never ends.
You're more than just a friend,
And my heart n soul, I'll always give to you.
The only in my life.
Someday you'll be my wife,
And I'll be with you until the end of time.
And now that I have you baby babe.
I promise I'll never leave, (never leave)
Cause' you're the only one,
That makes my life complete.
And I'm...
I'm crazy over you,
I don't know what to do,
I'm crazy over you,
And I'm...
I'm crazy over you,
I don't know what to do,
I'm crazy over you.
It doesn't matter what you say or do.
For I love you,
And I know you love me too
Oh...
Love me, (ooh..)
Kiss me, (ooh..)
And hold me in your arms.
That's we know you're crazy for me,
And I'm crazy over you.
(I told you) And you know, you know, you know...
(I told you, I will never leave you) never leave...
Because you're the only one, to make my life complete
That's why I'm crazy.
I'm crazy over you,
I don't what to do,
I'm crazy over you...
(Until end)
