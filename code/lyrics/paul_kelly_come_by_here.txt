Song:

When you feel that you ain't got a friend
Come by here, come by here
I'll open up my heart and I'll let you in
Come by here, come by here

Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here

When you're low, gets too much to bear
Come by here, come by here
In me, you got some one who care
Come by here, come by here

Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here

I'll make you read it right, I'll make your burns light
I'll be with you honey, whether you're wrong or right
I will, I will, I will, oh yes, you will
Come by here

Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here

If your world seem dark and weary
Come by here, come by here
I can brighten it up now if you just let me
Come by here, come by here

Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here

Oh baby, I'll make your way a little bit brighter
I'll make your low just a little bit light
I'll be your friend, your closest kin
I'll be with you till the end

Come by here, come by here
I'll make your way a little bit brighter
I'll make your low just a little bit light

Come by here, come by here
Come by here, come by here
Come by here
