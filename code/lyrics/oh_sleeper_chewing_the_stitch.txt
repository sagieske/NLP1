Song:

Oh my God, I can feel something moving
The air is still growing thick but it's soothing
I've done nothing to merit forgiving
But if the chance should arise and you hear me

Make my voice be the proof that they need
That light beams even from the tongues unseen

I've never felt so alive
The wind is ushering a change and
I can't believe I'm alive
After your attempts to free the pain and

You are the new sign of proof
A calloused heart can still be raised so
Stand and believe, that it's true
You hold the voice to change the sea

All the tearing of my skin starts deserting
All the guilt and the shame of the games
I played deaf to my heart starts to fade

Now I will speak for every one of us
The rebel dogs who rejected love
Chew the stitches until you taste the blood
Or find so much more when you give it up

Give it up
Give it up

We are monsters on our own (we are monsters on our own)
Banded together we'll overcome (banded together we'll overcome)
We are monsters on our own (we are monsters on our own)
Banded together we'll overcome (banded together we'll overcome)

Now that I've found you

I've never felt so alive
The wind is ushering a change and
I can't believe I'm alive
After your attempts to free the pain and

You ought to know
Shine above
A calloused heart can still be reached so
Stand and believe, that it's true
You hold the voice to change the sea

Don't expect us to apologize,
Rebel dogs in the spotlight
We want no truce
No truce or compromise
