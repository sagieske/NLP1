Song:

You ask me, you ask me
How I got to know you
Just by speaking on the phone?

Isn't is crazy
How the thought of my touch
Wakes you up when you're alone?

Don't you believe everything you hear
Darling, focus on the prize
Don't you hear me whisper in your ear
"My darling, don't lose sight of my eyes"

It's not time to let go
This is not how it's supposed to end in my mind my baby
Maybe our intentions were wrong from the start
So answer me so we don't fall apart

(I called 46 times! )
And you answered on the 47th
(I called you 46 times! )
And you answered on the 47th

You tell me, you tell me
You've never fell so hard
For an obvious candidate

You said you hate your last love
And it's soon enough that you will will forget

Don't believe everything you hear
Darling, I've never lied before
Don't you hear me whisper in your ear
"Forget him your what I'm waiting for"

It's not time to let go
This is not how it's supposed to end in my mind my baby
Maybe our intentions were wrong from the start
So answer me so we don't fall apart

You've even said yourself
You're setting yourself up
You've even said yourself
That everyone would turn (that everyone can turn! )

And you've even told yourself
That the floodgates would break
So why are you taking so long to answer?

It's not time to let go
This is not how it's supposed to end in my mind my baby
Maybe our intentions were wrong from the start
So answer me so we don't fall apart
So answer me so we don't fall apart
So answer me so we don't fall apart

(I called 46 times! )
And you answered on the 47th
(I called you 46 times! )
And you answered on the 47th
