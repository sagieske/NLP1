Song:

Chip Taylor

There'll be no strings to bind you hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Then slowly turn away from me

Maby the suns light will be dim
But it wont matter anyhow
If mornings echo says we've sinned
Well it would what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the nght
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Then slowly turn away, I wont beg you to stay with me, me

Through the tears, of the days, of the years
Baby, Baby, baby

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)

Repeat to fade
