Song:

Well you can bump and grind
If it's good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out

But you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No, no...

Well you can tell a plane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice

But you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No, no...

Ladida, ladida didadada
Ladida, ladida didadadadada
Ladida, ladida didadadadada
Ladida, ladida

You won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No you won't fool the Children of the Revolution
No you won't fool, no no baby, you won't fool the Children
No, no you can die before you have the time
You're gonna make it
Oh Ladida

Ladida, ladida didadada
Ladida, ladida didadadadadaa
