Song:

I've got a friend in Baltimore, little Liza Jane
Streetcars running by her door, little Liza Jane
Oh little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh little Liza, little Liza Jane

I've got a friend in San Antone, little Liza Jane
Tumbleweeds and cactus grow, little Liza Jane
I've got a friend in Providence, little Liza Jane
Bluebird sitting on the fence, little Liza Jane

I've got a friend in Chicago, little Liza Jane
Walk and feel the cold winds blow, little Liza Jane
I've got a friend in Sioux falls, little Liza Jane
Where sunflowers grow so tall, little Liza Jane

I've got a friend in Cape Cod, little Liza Jane
Bullfrogs singing in the pond, little Liza Jane
I've got a friend in Tokyo, little Liza Jane
Springtime ume blossoms grow, little Liza Jane
