Song:

Chorus
Lady of darkness
Nigh of my midnight (repeateded throughout track)

She flips through the pages of her fashion magazine
It pulls her out of her reality for a moment,
We all need our moments
She forgets for a couple of seconds about the hopeless situation
As the plane that seems to take all of the focus
Riding that afternoon plane from Dallas back to Minneappolis
Two and a half hours, she's out there
Reading some column about Spit versus Swallow
Everything reminds her of him,
And it's not fair

How could she fall on her face for some man-child?
Maybe it's his voice, or maybe it's his damn smile
Maybe it's the whole package,
From the kiss to the mattress,
To the sarcastic jokes, to the social status
Maybe it's none of the above
Maybe she only needed somebody genuine to show her love
It was all about the right place at the right time
And even with the drama they find that
He's still always on her mind

Well, nonetheless than two hours before she lands
To put her feet on the ground and take her man by the hand
And this time around when the laugh starts to sting,
She'll just take a breath and dig into that
