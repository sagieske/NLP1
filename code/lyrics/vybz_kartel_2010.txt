Song:

Milla nine
Every new year we see jah beside we
Every new year we see ah jah a guide we
More black people use to disappointment
So we didn't even ah watch last year happenings
Nah dwell pon di past ("kiss teeth")
You zimmi

Dah new year yah mi wah see di dollar sign deh
Mi nuh pree di past mi eye blind yea (oh)
Is ah new beginning mi ah look for
Mi nuh know weh two thousand nine deh
Fi two thousand and ten oh ten
Tank yuh father mi eye open
Mi spend a bagga songstar last year
Dar area ah sharer mi waan spend
Mi done wid every badmind old friend
Mi done wid every golddiger girlfriend
Mi ah save every money weh mi meck
Fi protect miself an mi pitney dem
Cah remember last year
January, february, march
Mi ah look fi di money but nut'n ever ah gwan
April, may, june
Mi ah look sameway mi nuh see weh money gone
Julyyy august september nut'n sameway
October (nut'n) november (nut'n) december
So

[Chorus:]
This is a new year
Different design
Ghetto youte different state a mind
Mi ah hold ah different meditation
Tings weh mi do two thousand nine (dem different)
Two thousand and ten (dem different)
Two thousand and ten (dem different)
Two thousand and ten (dem different)
Two thousand and ten

Ghetto youte it's dah talk you fi hear
Hope and faith bring in di new year
Mi member wen mi have ah one nike air
And mi one blue jeans did tear
Mi haffi sponge pon chegear fi ah beer
Beg ah spliff from boe over deh

In ih first bwoy launch ah career
But remember last year

Tings weh mi do two thousand nine (dem different)
