Song:

It's a little bit late now,
But there's times you will
Get a little bit out of hand,
Making all of a spill.
And if we can lay this down,
You're going all the way.
Take a look and I'll check it out,
'cause I can always find it.

Such a lonely place. Ooh.
This room without your face. Ooh.

Chorus
Ooh. American Science.
All night long she can two-step and sway.
Ooh, it's such awful manners.
Don't keep me waiting, come and lie beside me.

A little megalomania becomes you, evidently.
There ain't a thing you can't acquire
With your cling-wrap plaything.
Just look at this state.
I crawl around in a daze,
Like symptomatic case
Of your soul persuasion.

Such a lonely place. Ooh.
This room without your face. Ooh.

Chorus

Ooh, it's a little bit later now,
And there's time you will let it all get
Out of hand when you feel you feel.
I just switched on the operation.
Such a lovely face. Ooh.
It pulls me into place. Ooh.

Chorus (Repeat for fade)
