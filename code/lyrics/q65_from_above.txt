Song:

And my love she's still smiling to me
Don't you run, she wants to cry
She found out that I don't love her
And other things I said were lies

She cannot turn me loose, oh no
In spite of everything she's still in love
To her lovesick mind I'm from above

My love, she is a quarrely girl
She just can't quarrel with me
When I say: "I want to love you"
She says: "You must wait and see"

She cannot turn me loose, oh no
In spite of everything she's still in love
To her lovesick mind I'm from above

I think I don't want to pray
'Cause I need a childish love
I found out that it's too fine
Yes, it's too fine to swap

I cannot turn her loose, oh no
In spite of her 'cause I'm in love
To my lovesick mind she's from above

I cannot turn her loose, oh no
In spite of her 'cause I'm in love
To my lovesick mind she's from above

I cannot turn her loose, oh no
In spite of her 'cause I'm in love
Well, to my lovesick mind she's from above

I cannot turn her loose, oh no
In spite of her 'cause I'm in love
Well, to my lovesick mind she's from above
