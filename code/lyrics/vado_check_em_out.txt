Song:

Dog posing, hoes before closing
Pull up to the curbe drop heads who go rosing
... posing, couldn't be more chosen, 
If not make sure you want a... callway
Bruise balling, type d, right v, give fresh cool we go hard like mike b
The thirteen's riding red my bike's b
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Oh, check em out, or go ahead check em out
Where would you wanna wear, if you don't care, let them out
Ain't have to prepare, cause the west suited out
Chronicle with the... booted out
You know I stay booted out, never dress to cute if I may to shoot it out
Get you a few sets truly and the louie... 
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Let's go
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh

Yo, there's a reason they ain't... high
Cause it's only one pair of these
Watch me you step trying to take care of these
You can tell how I'm dressed, I'm a rare breed
D boy fresh still hard though, 40 belows on
... cargos, brand new, but I got them last year
And my hoody is 100% cashmere, ah
When you see me you think dollars
Persian lamb, made colors
If it ain't the retros it's hot top air force one, cheap... 
Thou shall judge but not hate me
Polo mansion, not... 
I see these boys gonna make me
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Check em out, check em out, check em out
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh
Get fresh, get fresh, get fresh.
