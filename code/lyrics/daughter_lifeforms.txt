Song:

From the beginning,
Small lifeforms
They can kill without warning
So you don't explore
Stop you growing limbs and thinking
That you love them, now you're blinking
And reminding her of him
Oh you steal his features
And your mother is a bleacher
She don't even feel the heat, no
She don't even want to speak to you

But you, you'll always find another place
To go, oh, you
You'll always find another womb, to grow
To grow, oho, oho, oho, to grow

Well you can try to sink down deeply
To find the children lost at sea
Find the children who discretely
Were killed in infancy
To stop them holding you with screaming
The illusion, what is dreaming?
Still reminding you of him
How he left without reasons

But you, you'll always find another place
To go, oh, you
You'll always find another womb, to grow
To grow, oho, oho, oho, to grow

Well you can try to forget me
But I won't let you easy
You can try to forget me
But I won't let you easy
I'm falling out in the water
I start to sink

Drifting away, with time
You regret you conceived it
Clean up the dead you leave behind
Just like insects
Clean up the dead you leave behind.
