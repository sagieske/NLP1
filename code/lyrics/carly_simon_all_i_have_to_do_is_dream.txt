Song:

(Felice & Boudleaux Bryant)

I can make you mine,
Taste your lips of wine,
Any time, night or day.
Only trouble is, gee whiz,
I'm dreamin' my life away.

Dream,
Dream, dream, dream,
Dream,
Dream, dream, dream
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream,
Dream, dream, dream.

When I want you
In the night,
When I want you
To hold me tight,
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream,
Dream, dream, dream,
Dream,
Dream, dream, dream.

I can make you mine,
Taste your lips of wine,
Any time, night or day.
Only trouble is, gee whiz,
I'm dreamin' my life away.

I need you so
That I could die.
I want you so
And that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream,
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream,
Dream,
Dream, dream, to dream, to dream, to dream,
Dream,
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.
