Song:

I remember when daddy said
What do you want to be?
I said I wanna be a mermaid to live under the sea
Well I knew it wouldn't work out as I looked down to my feet
Then my gradad paid me my very first record and that's when it changed for me
It me smile, made me sing, made my worries fly away
Setting me up, setting me free
I could be Billie Holiday
In the silence hard to think about
When in reality you gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally

I went to sit by the keys
To work on my first songs
I had the melodies in my head
But they were coming out all wrong
Then I worked out some harmonies, that went...
And then that sweet sound spoke to me
And told where I belong

It me smile, made me sing, made my worries fly away
Setting me up, setting me free
I could be Billie Holiday
In the silence hard to think about
When in reality you gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally

Fly away
So naturally
Toss the stress away
Cause I know, yeah I know, that it'll make you feel alright

It me smile, made me sing, made my worries fly away
Setting me up, setting me free
I could be Billie Holiday
In the silence hard to think about
When in reality you gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally

Gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally
Gotta sit back
Just relax, and let it happen naturally
