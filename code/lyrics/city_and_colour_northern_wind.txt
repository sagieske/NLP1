Song:

You're the Northern Wind
Sending shivers down my spine
You're like falling leaves
In an autumn night

You're the lullaby
That's singing me to sleep
You are the other half
You're like the missing piece

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me, to me

You are all four seasons
Rolled into one
Like the cold December snow
In the warm July sun

I'm the jet black sky
That's just before the rain
Like the mighty current 
Pulling you under the waves

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know what you do to me
To me
I'm the darkest hour
Just before the dawn
And I'm slowly sinking
Into the slough of despond

Like an old guitar
Worn out and left behind
I have stories still to tell
They're of the healing kind

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
If I could just 
Find you tonight
If I could just find you tonight
Oh my love

Do do do
