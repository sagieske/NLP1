Ooh yeah!
Oh yeah!

You can't get romantic on a subway line
Conductor don't like it, says, "You're wastin' your time"

But everybody wants some!
I want some too
Everybody wants some!
Baby, how 'bout you?

Oh! Oh yeah!

I took a mobile light, lookin' for a moonbeam. Ow!
Yeah, ya stand in line ya got lost in a jet stream

Ooh, everybody wants some!

Everybody wants some!
