Song:

We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for...

Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
We pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour

Let the party rock!

Put your hands up
Everybody just dance up
We came to party rock
Smash your titties like Molly Graw

They call me red foo
I walk in the club with a bottle or two
Shake it, spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two

I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget (won't forget)

We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for...

Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
We pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour

Let the party rock!

Boom!
Guess who stepped in the room
Sky blue, Redfoo and Goon
She's a party rocker from night 'til noon
And it's about to be a champagne monsoon
Baby girl, you look legit
Come to my table and take a seat
Open wide 'cause we're spraying it
Fifty six bottles ain't payed for s**t

I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget (won't forget)

We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for...

Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
We pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour

Party people
Now I want you to grab your bottles
Put them up in the air
Now shake, shake, shake that bottle then make it

We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for...
