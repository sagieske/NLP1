Song:

This is a song for every girl who's ever been through something, she thought she couldn't make it through (yeah, hmm)

I sing these words because I was that girl too, wanting something better than this, but who do I turn to?

Now were moving from the darkness into the light, this is the defining moment of our lives. (umm, yeah)

'Cause your beautiful like a flower, more valuable than a diamond, you are powerful like a fire, you can hela the world with your mind and there is nothing in the world that you cannot do, when you believe in you (who are beautiful), yeah you (who are brilliant), yeah you (who are powerful), yeah you (who are resilient)

This is a song for every girl who feels that she is not special

'Cause you don't look like a supermodel, coke bottle

The next ime the radio tells you to shake your moneymaker, shake your head and tell them, them them you're a leader

Now were moving from the darkness into the light, this is the defining moment of our lives. (yeah)

'Cause your beautiful like a flower, more valuable than a diamond, you are powerful like a fire, you can heal the world with your mind and there is nothing in the world that you cannot do, when you believe in you (who are beautiful), yeah you (who are brilliant), yeah you (who are powerful), yeah you (who are resilient)

Yeah you (who are beautiful)

Yeah you (who are brilliant)

Yeah you (who are powerful)

Yeah you (who are resilient)

Yeah you (this song is for you)

Yeah you (this song is for you)

Yeah you (this song is for you)

Yeah you

Yeah you

You are brilliant
