Song:

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face
They jive with the Hoodoos, man
No one could take his place, no, no, no

He needed extra cash
So he drove his brother's cab
The day we heard the news, you know
It really hit us bad, yeah, yeah, yeah

It was the day that Arthur died
It was the day that Arthur died

A black Gelato van
Was finished for the day
It met with Arthur's taxi head-on
Down St. Kilda way, the Prince Of Wales

That was the way that Arthur died
Upon the day that Arthur died, I cried

Arthur played the bass
He had an angel's face
Well, he jived with the Hoodoo Gurus and you know
No ones ever gonna take his ever loving place
No no, not me nor anyone here

Since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur died
Ever since the day that Arthur died
