Song:

Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were oh what a lie
Once we were dreamers
Just dreamers we were oh you and I
Now I see you're just somebody
Who wastes all my time and money
What a lie
You and I

What about your
Your 10, 000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10, 000 promises
That you promised me

Once I could handle the truth
When the truth was you and I
But time after time all the promises
Turned out to be all lies
And now, now I see that you're somebody
Who wasted my time and money
What lie, oh what a lie (what a lie)
Oh you, you and I, oh you and I

What about your
Your 10, 000 promises?
That you gave to me (to me, babe)
Your 10, 000 promises
That you promised me

You say I'll take you back
But I close the door
'Cause I don't want 10, 000 more

10, 000 promises yeah
10, 000 promises you gave to me

What about your
Your 10, 000 promises?
That you gave to me
Your 10, 000 promises
That you promised me
(what about your)
Your 10, 000 promises (10, 000 promises you gave to me)
That you gave to me (what about your)
Your 10, 000 promises
(what about your 10, 000 promises you gave to me?)

Once we were lovers
Just lovers we were
You and I
What a lie
