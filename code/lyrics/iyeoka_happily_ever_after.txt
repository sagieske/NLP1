Song:

I am young, I wear no armor
No ability to become stone
You will abandon me when I am broken
You will abandon me when I an old
You will betray me, you will betray me
On more twilights than I deserve
Dancing on the graves of our yesterdays
Diggin down, down the bones of our love

I am young, I wear no armor
No ability to become stone
You will betray me, you will betray me
On more twilights than I deserve
You will discover that I am not the girl
I am not the girl you thought I was
You have found a way to strangle her
Burying this sweet little girl into the ground

Break down, break down down
The walls of happily every after

You will leave the girl
You will leave this girl behind
Slowly detaching from the memories
Of ever knowing a love like mine
I will get up in the morning
I will avoid wasting these days
I will find a way to revive the woman I loved
Before I chose to love you that way

I am young, I wear no armor
No abilities to become stone
My eyes will reflect everything about me
That you will never know
