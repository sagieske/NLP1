Song:

You felt the coldness in my eyes
And something I'm not revealing
Though you got used to my disguise,
You can't shake this awful feeling
It's the me that I let you know,
And I'll never show, I have my reasons
Hate to say that I told you so, but I told you so...

There's blood on my hands, like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So don't make me don't make me be myself around you

Straight from your eyes it's barely me,
Beautifully so disfigured
This other side that you can't see
Just praying you won't remember

Feel the pain that I never show
And I hope you know, it's never healing
Hate to say that I told you so, but I told you so...

Yeah.!!!

There's blood on my hands, like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So don't make me don't make
Me be myself around you

Straight from your eyes it's barely me,
Beautifully so disfigured
This other side that you can't see
Just praying you won't remember

[Interlude]

There's blood on my hands, like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So don't make me...

There's blood on my hands, like the blood in you
Some things can't be treated
So don't make me don't make me be myself around you...

There's blood!
