Song:

I gave up cigarettes
I haven't had to light one yet
And it's been a year since I stopped
The same goes for alcohol
I don't touch the stuff at all
And I used to drink till I dropped
Those were tough, this is easy
And it feels so good to say
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

Friends said it'd take some time
To get you off my mind
They thought I'd never let you go
Well, I guess I proved them wrong
One more bad habit gone
Just like the whiskey and the smokes
Those were tough, this is easy
Well, I'm all right, yeah, I'm okay
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day

I've given you up for good
Just like I said I would
The night you walked away
Forgetting you is not that hard to do
I've done it a thousand times a day
Yes, I've done it a thousand times a day
