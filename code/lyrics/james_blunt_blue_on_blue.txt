Song:

How come you don't wanna see me?
How come you gonna left me alone?
How come, you took a slow boat to China?
What can I do if I can't get through to you?
Baby, blue on blue...

I want you more than I ever wanted
Than I ever need it... Anyone I ever knew

I love you more than I ever
Thought that I would never
Feel the way that I do

How long you gonna leave me here standing?
How long till you gonna make up your mind?
How long is your balloon ride to nowhere?

What can I do if I can't be there with you?
Baby, blue on blue...

I want you more than I ever wanted
Than I ever need it... Anyone I ever knew

I love you more than I ever
Thought that I would never
Feel the way that I do

I'm coming under fire (x8)

Baby, blue on blue...
