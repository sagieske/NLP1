Song:

Please don't hurt me
I have told you
All my love is all I've got
But tomorrow is the day
When I, for your sake, am coming back
And you tell me that I don't love you

I'm trying hard to make you jealous
I'm trying harder to make you stay
Days are long and nights are crazy
It's so strange when you're away
And you tell me that I don't love you

Because I love you
I will show you
All the faces my love can have
So please let me come to you
And stay this time
And you tell me that I don't love you
Oh, you know that it's just not true
