Song:

Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who live by intolerance and hate
For what they couldnt understand
Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Needing and ripping at a beautiful human
Who did nothing more than be himself

Tied to the fences they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And Sadness will sear

Scarecrow is left crucified
Left freezing, bleeding, tired of wondering why
The wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers and the teachers
Government's close-minded creatures
Trying to teach us to hate
That which is different

Tied to the fences they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And Sadness will sear

It's 12:53 AM, October 12th
When the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty

It's 12:53 AM, October 12th
When the shepherd died
The candle's light will alight your departure

Tied to the fences they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And Sadness will sear

Tied to the fences they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And Sadness will sear
