Song:

In the sky I see my weakness
All day long I dream about you

Promise made that we won't meet anymore
Never been so hard to break with the past

Sweet world it's over, dream time is over
Another story comes and goes

Lying by your side in the park
Can't take my eyes off of you

Floating in a tall-grass sea of green
Never been so hard to break with the past

Sweet world it's over, dream time is over
Another story comes and goes

In the sky I see your reflection
Gust of wind carries the scent of your hair

On your lips there's a taste I won't remember
Never been so hard to break with the past

Sweet world it's over, dream time is over
Another story comes and goes
