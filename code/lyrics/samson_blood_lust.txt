Song:

Here I stand, I believe it's true
Running out, light's running out on you
Witnesses we are all together
Preacher's son waits for heavy weather
Bloodlust I'm letting go
Alone a lion waits for you
Cry for forgiveness for what I am about to do
Years ago I began to fall
But, now you're here I'll end it all and cry
Got me here again, waiting for a sign
Raising my hands to the sky
The rain will fall and end it all someday
But until then I'll wait on my mountain and pray
I knew
