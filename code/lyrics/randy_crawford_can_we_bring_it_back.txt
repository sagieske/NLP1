Song:

So many times without even trying
You were always there and I was unaware
And now my heart is breaking for you
And my soul is aching for you too

Can we bring it back
If only we knew how
We could use a little heaven now
A little heaven

Can we bring it back
It's up to you and me
It could be the way it used to be
A little heaven is all we need
To bring it back

I've lost you, it seems, knowing my dreams
Love is still a lot, I see it in our eyes
And it's though we've never been apart
And for us there are no broken hearts

This love is, oh, so true
This love you've given too
That we're keeping here deep inside
So deep inside

Can't we bring it back
If only we knew how
We could use a little heaven now
A little heaven is all we need
To bring it back

Tried to make it on my own
To erase the love we've known
But it's just no use pretending
When love keeps winning

Can't we bring it back
If only we knew how
We could use a little heaven now
A little heaven

Can we bring it back
It's up to you and me
We could solve the mystery
A little heaven is all we needed
To bring it back
