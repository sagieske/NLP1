Song:

Oh yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeahhh

Every morning
I wake up to find
I always dream the same
Every night I come to my window
When you call my name
But the way the words
You say just fall like rain
Till I'm drowning in the sound of your invitation

When you ask do you wanna dance, my barefoot cinderella
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right
Now is what I like the best
And then you
Say do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, my barefoot cinderella
Yeah, ohh

A dream world is always perfect
But that's not my real life
Wish you did but you don't know
Then me I am inside
I pray that you'll come lookin' and I won't hide (won't hide)
I'm smiling when you find me
Coz I've been waiting

For you ask do you wanna dance, my barefoot cinderella
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right
Now is what I like the best
And then you
Say do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever
No one will ever be more beautiful
My barefoot, my barefoot cinderella

When I close my eyes it starts, yeah
Like a movie for my heart
Here comes my favourite part
Yeaahhhh ohhhh

When you ask do you wanna dance, my barefoot cinderella
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
You're what I like the best
And then you

Say "do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever
No one will ever be more beautiful
Oohhhh cinderella

When you ask do you wanna dance, my barefoot cinderella
Don't need no slippers or a party dress
The way you're lookin' right
Now is what I like the best
And then you
Say "do you wanna take a chance
Stay with me forever
No one will ever be more beautiful my barefoot
My barefoot cinderella
