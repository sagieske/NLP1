Song:

The evening sun is falling, that old blue moon is calling
My guardian angel in the sky came through
To help all my dreams come true, there's a new star

There's a new star coming tonight, there's a new love burning
So bright, for a new star of love is born between the earth and sky
For you and I, there's a new star

The moon was dull, the sky was cold and gray
There were no stars to light my lonely way
And then I traced the love light in your eyes
To a new star twinkling in the sky burning bright, day and night

Now I'm alright, now we're together, lovers forever
A new star, a new star to light our way
There's a new star burning for us, there's a new world turning for us
There's a new star sparkling in the sky

There's a new star shining somewhere
And we know the reason why
There's a new star way up there for a true love
A new star for our love will never die
