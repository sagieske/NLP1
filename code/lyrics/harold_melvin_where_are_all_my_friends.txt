Song:

(Where are all my friends)
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Use to have lots of fancy clothes
And drive a big white cadillac
Not knowing all the time I had these things
My friends were stabbing me straight in my back, no, no, no.

Even had a house then
Out there in Beverly Hills
I was moving so fast y'all
I didn't even have time to worry about paying my bills.
(Something started changing)
My life started rearranging
(Now I'm all alone. All the friends I wanted)
I don't have anymore
So somebody tell, tell me
(Where are all my friends)
I can't find nobody
(Where are all my friends)
Oh Lord, Oh Lord

Use to take my friends out
Everywhere I went
But I use to tell them that y'all
Y'all ain't gotta spend a red cent
Cause I use to have lots of money
I had 'em in big old stacks
I use to lend 'em my clothes
But they never, never ever, never, never brought 'em back
(Now I don't have nothing)
I'm so all alone
(Don't even have a home)
I ain't got no place to lay my head
(Wish someone would help me)
Cause I, I, I, I, I, I need a loan

Yeah baby
(Where are all my friends)
I'm looking y'all, I'm lookin' all over
(Where are all my friends)
I'm looking for the friends I use to call my very own
(Where are all my friends)
I need somebody right now, hey
(Where are all my friends)
I can't find a father or a mother
(Where are all my friends)
I remember the time I use to be walking
Up and down the streets
And I remember you, and you and you and you and you
I remember when you use to say that
Yeah trying to get me to spare a dime
And I use to come out the bottom of my heart
Cause I thought you were a friend of mine
But it seems yeah, it seems that you didn't even give a damn about me, no
But now I'm down and out and I need a friend.
