Song:

Well I just heard the news today
Seems my life is gonna change
I close my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

With arms wide open

Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I take a breath, I take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open

With arms wide open
I'll show you everything oh yeah
With arms wide open

If I had just one wish only one demand
I hope he's not like me I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

With arms wide open
Under the sunlight
Welcome to this place
I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
Now everything has changed
I'll show you love
I'll show you everything
Wth arms wide open

With arms wide open
I'll show you everything oh yeah
With arms wide open
