(coverdale/vandenberg)

I need your love to get me through
All the things I wanna do,
Babe, if you want me to
I'll get on my knees for you
But, you gotta give me a little sign,
You got the same thing on your mind
Every day an' every night
Give me the green light

An' let it roll, let it ride,
I'll be your dog 'til you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
Cos' for a spoonful of your sugar
I would do anything
Anything you want,
Anything you need
Anytime at all

It is so hard for you to see,
I just love your company
An' there ain't nothing I won't do,
Just to prove my love to you

An' let it roll, let it ride,
I'll be your dog 'til you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
Cos' for a spoonful of your sugar
I would do anything

So baby, try to understand
I was born to be your man
Don't keep me knocking at your door,
Just tell me yes or tell me no

An' let it roll, let it ride,
I'll be your dog 'til you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
Cos' for a spoonful of your sugar
I would do anything
Anything you want,
Anything you need
