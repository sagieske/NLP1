Song:

Radio's fine
It helps me forget for awhile
I look back and recall
Those days I had with you
Sometimes I need a friend
Just to make it through
Another day without you

You gave me all the reasons to live
Then you had to go
And I just got to let you know
It's hard to love again
Just to make it through
Another day spent without you

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to go on pretending
That it's going to be a happy ending
If I should love again
Once I've learned to love again
And, no, it will never be the same
Without you baby
This pain inside me is driving me crazy
'Cause, it's hard to love again

Friends are great
They cheer me up for sometime
When the day is done
My mind is back again with you
Oh God, I need a friend
Just to make it through
Another day spent without you

[Repeat chorus 'til fade]
