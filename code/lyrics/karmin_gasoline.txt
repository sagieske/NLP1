Song:

Girl you can't deny it, the sparks are flying
And I know just what we could do
A little closer, I wanna know you
So we can leave behind the crew
Now let's get together and light up the dark
Before the night is through
Know what you're thinking, so let me bring it
We gettin' melted me and you

You bring the match, I'll bring the gasoline
Turn out the lights, baby let me see
We get the fire so hot, we can burn it up
You know what I mean
You bring the match, I'll bring the gasoline

We can heat it up, up, up, up
We can heat it up, up, up, up

Tell me what you're drinking, gimme a sip and
Don't leave me out here in the cold
Nobody's watching, so no more talking
Stop, drop, and we can roll

Can you give me a light so that we can ignite
Yeah I see the way you look at me
Come on pass me that torch what are you waiting for
You know I'mma give you what you need
