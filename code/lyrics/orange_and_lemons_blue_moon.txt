Song:

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love on my own...

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love on my own...

Blue moon
You knew just what i was there for
You heard me saying a prayer
For someone i really could care for.

And suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, "please, adore me"
And when i looked my moon had turned to gold.

Blue moon,
Now i'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own...
