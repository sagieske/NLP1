Song:

This hotel bar is full of people, the piano man is really laying it down
The old bartender is a high as a steeple, so why tonight should I wear a frown? (Yes, I'm a...)

Million miles away, I'm a million miles away
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay

Why ask how I feel how does it look to you?
I feel hook, line and sinker, I lost my captain and my crew
I'm standing on the landing, there's no one there but me
That's where you'll find me, looking out on the deep blue sea

This hotel bar is full of people, the piano man is really laying it down
The old bartender is a high as steeple, so why tonight should I wear a frown?

The joint is jumping all around me and my mood is really not in style
Right now the blues want to surround me but I'll break out after a while

Well, I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay

Why ask how I feel, well, how does it look to you?
I feel hook line and sinker, I lost my captain and my crew
I'm standing on the landing and there's no one there but me
That's where you'll find me, looking out on the deep blue see

There's a song on the lips of everybody, there's a smile all around the room
There's conversation overflowing, so why must I sit here in the gloom?

This hotel bar lost all it's people, the piano man has caught the last bus home
The old bartender is asleep in the corner, so why must I still be here, I don't know

Well, I'm a million miles away, I'm a million miles away
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay
