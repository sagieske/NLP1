Dear Diary,

Something good happened today

He finally called me by my name

I didn't know how to behave

What to say or do

I was so confused



Dear Diary,

I wanna talk to him again

But whenever he is with his friends

He keeps trying to pretend

But I already see

The way he feels for me



What can I do?

Tell me what can I say

When do I let him know I feel the same way?

How can my feelings be so hard to show when

I really want him to know



Dear Diary,

He wrote some letters on his hand

It wasn't hard to understand

I figured I'm part of his plans

But now I'm in his heart

I don't know where to start



What can I do?

Tell me what can I say

When do I let him know I feel the same way?

How can my feelings be so hard to show when

I really want him to know



BRIDGE

You're my secret hiding place

Where my private thoughts are safe

And just one look and he will see

What's inside of me



What can I do?

Tell me what can I say

When do I let him know I feel the same way?

How can my feelings be so hard to show when

I really want him to know



What can I do?

Tell me what can I say

When do I let him know I feel the same way?

How can my feelings be so hard to show when

I really want him to know



Dear Diary

Dear Diary
