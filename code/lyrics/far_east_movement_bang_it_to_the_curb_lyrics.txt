Song:

[Bridge:]
Bang bang it
Bang bang it to the curb
Bang bang it
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

[Verse:]
Bangin down the block with my Remy bottle
Rep reppin 213, California motto
Serving all the fiends like king taco
My cheese nachos, bossin til you unfollow
Windows down the Lac, just a a** crack
Nothing but the Alpine system on smash
Keep a stash in the dash with a puff puff pass
Fly faster that the 5O
Bang it to the curb!

[Hook:]
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!
Oh word, we absurd, got that fire we can burn
Bang bang it to the curb!
Bang it to the curb, bang it bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb, bang it bang it to the curb
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

[Bridge:]
Bang it to the curb!
Bang bang it
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

[Verse:]
F1 eatin hoes but they my brothers
4 goons at the motel undercover
Play it quick, cruising la in a Ford Runner
Plus that hatchback booty slappin like my subwoofer
Slip slidin to yo house, where yo dogs at?
Fat beats for the kitty from the other clap
Hit up city, dancing if you need the fat checks
Lootin liquor stores, I be flickin match sticks
Bang it to the curb!

[Hook:]
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!
Oh word, we absurd, got that fire we can burn
Bang bang it to the curb!
Bang it to the curb, bang it bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb, bang it bang it to the curb
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

[Bridge:]
Nothing but that fat bass on that fat a**
With my 808 on blast
Nothing but that fat bass on that fat a**
With my 808 on blast
Nothing but that fat bass on that fat a**
With my 808 on blast
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

Bang bang it
Bang bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb, bang it to the curb
Bang it to the curb, bang it to the curb
Hit the town, flip the bird, bust a b***h, make em swerve
Bang bang it to the curb!

Bang it to the curb!

Bang bang it
Bang bang it
