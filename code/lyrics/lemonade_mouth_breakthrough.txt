(Oooh Yeah mmm breakthrough)

Up down spinnin' all around
Fly high, fallin' to the ground
Sometimes dreams can feel so far away
Time keeps skippin' out of beat
Left, right, trippin' on your feet
Life is like a string of cloudy days

(Here we go)
Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin' to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight
Keep on, Keep on movin' on
Keep on movin' on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's time I breakthrough
Just turn the page
Cause every day I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it 'til you make it 'til you're breakin' on through
Don't stop 'til you're breakin' on through
Shake it 'til you make it 'til you're breakin' on through
Don't stop 'til you're breakin' on through

Stop, still take another breath
Roadblock, move it to the left
Get around whatever's in your way
Heartbreak, pick up all the pieces
Don't stop dancin' in the bleachers
It's gonna be your turn to play
Gonna be your turn to play

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin' to the world it was wrong
Whenever you can't see the light
Whenever there's no end in sight (Here we go)
Keep on, Keep on moving on
Keep on moving on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
So don't let it get away
It's all about a breakthrough
Just turn the page
Cause every day you're getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

I can see it in the blind site
Movin' through the limelight
Groovin' to my music I'ma use it when the time's right
Hopin' I can do it through
The shadows I can shine bright
Usually in life there's one shot
And this is our night
Listen to the rhythm we givin' and it'll make you
Start pushin' through barriers It'll take you
Wherever that you wanna go
Never too late to
Keep pushin' 'til you breakthrough

Sometimes it's raisin' your voice
Sometimes it's makin' some noise
Sometimes it's provin' to the world it was wrong (world it was wrong)
Whenever you can't see the light (can't see the light)
Whenever there's no end in sight (no end in sight)
Keep on, Keep on movin' on
Keep on movin' on

Here comes a breakthrough
Here comes a day
Here comes a moment that you gotta go for it
It's time I breakthrough
Just turn the page
Cause every day I'm getting closer
Life is just a rollercoaster

Shake it 'til you make it you're breakin' on through
Don't stop 'til you're breakin' on through
Shake it 'til you make it you're breakin' on through (put your hands up)
Don't stop 'til you're breakin' on through (put your hands up)

Shake it 'til you make it you're breakin' on through
Don't stop 'til you're breakin' on through (don't stop, don't stop, don't stop no)
Shake it 'til you make it you're breakin' on through
Don't stop

Here comes a breakthrough
