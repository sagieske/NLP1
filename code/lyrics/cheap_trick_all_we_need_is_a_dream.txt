Song:

Hello, hello
Is there anyone?
You don't know
How I've searched, searched the world for you
Hello, hello
Is there any place
A thousand hearts, a million miles of dreams and thoughts of you
All right
It's been a long time [comin' / gettin'] to you
All right
I'm a-comin' for you, well
All we need, we need is a dream
All we neeed is a night
All we need is a night to call our own
All we need, we need is a dream
All we need is one night
All we need is a dream to call our own
All we need...
Hello, hello
It's for everyone
That you know who needs someone
To help you make it through
