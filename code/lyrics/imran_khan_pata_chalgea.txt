Song:

A 1, a 2, a 1 2 3 4... Ra pa pa la la la...
Kayndi aa naray meray aa, saday naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray meray aa, meray naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal way tu nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal gal karda kiun nahi
She says come near me, why don't you talk to me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart

Teriyan gallan nu main karan na yaqeen aa
I don't believe the tales you tell me
Pawain tu lagain ik movie da tu scene aa
Even though you look like you're a scene from a film
Tera na husn da aiyna main shaqeen aa
I am not such a fan of your beauty
Phir kiun vakhawien menu d&g de jean
Then why do you show me your D&G jeans?
Saday thay chalna nai tera ni aye zor
Your magic is not going to work on us
Pata way chal gaya ke dillan di tu chor
We know what a unfaithful lover you are
Yaar nu chad kai tu aa gai saday kol
You left your lover behind and came to us
Jawani pasay pichay pichay avayen na tu ror
Don't try to mess with our youthfulness

Kayndi aa naray meray aa, saday naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray meray aa, meray naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal way tu nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal gal karda kiun nahi
She says come near me, why don't you talk to me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart

Han day mundiya nu moun ve na laandi ya
The guys of her status she doesn't acknowledge
Chand thay tariyaan nu siddha hath paandi ya
She goes straight for the moon and the stars
Ban ke shareef way lokaan nu wakhandi ya
Pretending to be innocent in front of everyone
Nouta nu veykh veykh pichay saaday aandi ya
Seeing the dollars, she comes to us
Saday tho door door door hi to reh ni
Stay away, away, away from us
Mithiyaan tu gallan to kisi hor nu suna ni
Go tell your sweet tales to someone else
Lokan diyan nazraan ch kuri ay tu class di
In many people's eyes you may be of class
Sadiyaan nazraan ch kisay day na
But for us you are nothing

Kayndi aa naray meray aa, saday naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray meray aa, meray naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal way tu nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal gal karda kiun nahi
She says come near me, why don't you talk to me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart

Ni kuri oowaday utay mardi yay
A girl that "loves" him
Nai avayen tu beat utay nachay di yay
You dance for no reason
Ni saanu do numbran de lagdi yay ] x2
Seems to us that she isn't "clean"
Nee akhaan kad kad way tak dee, samnay oh rayhnay tarlay oh paandi yay
She stares, stays in front of us, begging in a way

Kayndi aa naray meray aa, saday naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray meray aa, meray naal nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal way tu nach da kiun nai
She says come near me, why don't you dance with me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart
Kayndi aa naray aa meray naal gal karda kiun nahi
She says come near me, why don't you talk to me?
Main teynu veykhaan tu mainu veykhien
I look at you, you look at me
Thay saanu pata chal gaya teray dil ich ki
And I know what's in your heart
