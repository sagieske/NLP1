Song:

Action
This street honey is a mean street
Living in thsi street honey needsa a mean
Streak
Weve got criminals living in this street
But there's a heartbeet pulse that keeps on
Pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a showdown
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keep in
Pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a
Shutter
Or a sight of a light at
The end of a tunnel
I got a feeling, this world is using me
Action this day
Action this night
Weve gotta learn to learn to live to love
You can't say it aint right
Action this day
Action this night
Youve got the power, youve got the power
Youve got the power to love and to live
You can't say it aint right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your minds living in a bleak place
Your mind is coming from a rat racce
But there's a heartbeet pulse that keeps on
Pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just wont quit, this
World is using me
Action this day
Action this night
Weve gotta learn to learn to live to love
We can't say it aint right
Action this day
Action this night
Youve got the power, youve got the power
Youve got the power to love, to live
You can't say it aint right
Action
Action this day
