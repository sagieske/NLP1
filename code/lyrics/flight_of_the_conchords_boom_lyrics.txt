Song:

Oh my god
She's so hot
She's so flippin' hot
She's like a curry
I want to tell her how hot she is
But she'll think I'm being sexiest
She's so hot she's making me sexiest... B***h!
I need my 1987 dj-20 Cassio electric guitar set to, mandolin
Yer - drop the drums
Here me now!
I see you give the sign
I want to boom like it's never been done
Busting moves at the click boom of a gun
In the marquee and the bass is boom
And someone's smoking boom at the back of the room
And it's the first day of boom and the flowers are blooming
Drum and bass and the party is booming
Boom the boom like a rocket taking off to the moon
Boom boom like a bride and boom

See you shaking that boom boom
See you looking at my boom boom
See you want some boom boom
It's clear as boom time boom boom

Let me buy you a boom boom
You order a fancy boom
You like boom, and I like boom
Enough small boom lets boom the boom

'Fast forward salecta'

Now we're rolling on a boom boom
Ridin' to a more private room
And we know what's happenin' we both assume
We're gunna boom boom 'til the break of boom

Who's the boom king? (who)
I'm the boom king (what)
Who's the boom king? (tell me now)
I'm da boom king (he's the boom king)

Chuga chuga chuga huh huh huh
Chuga chuga chuga huh huh huh
Chuga chuga chuga huh huh huh
Chuga chuga chuga huh huh huh

And my phone is beeping it's b-boom boom
He's back from ten years doom and gloom
He said he had his boom choped off in the boom
But the crazy boom still loves the boom
Unzip the boom and my lens goes zoom
My b-boom drops ba-doompa ba-boom
We both get freaky and the boom gets squeeky
And we boom boom boom boom boom boom boom!

Who's the boom king? (who)
I'm the boom king (what)
Who's the boom king? (ha)
I'm da boom king (Bret's the boom king)
