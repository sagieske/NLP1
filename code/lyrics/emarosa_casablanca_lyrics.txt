Song:

I'm watching the sky turn from black to the grey
and this is the end i know we're not afraid
surrender your hands its to late to let go
we're still breathing, dont stop breathing
the ground is falling under my feet
we're still around here
we're fading with time
there's no fear open your eyes
we're standing still now
we're going nowhere
its not to late to crawl its not to late

reach the end ill meet you there
in a world that never let you in
in a world where you found grace
i watched the water pull you in
(as it carries you away)

i know you wont let fall on my own
there's no reason reason to abandon here

open your eyes and witness the power
of a place thats lost control
his creation at its finest
its what we call our home

my life passes by as the sky starts to fade
if this is the end i know im not afraid
the meaning of this is becoming so clear
prepare for the worst this is going to be hell
i know you wont be there i fall alone
tell me why i am still standing here
