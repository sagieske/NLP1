Song:

Form a circle with the chairs
Check in quickly
Are you
Hungry
Angry
Lonely
Or tired

Words of wisdom from someone
Who has been clean
11 years
Still
Angry
Lonely
And tired

Cannot wash
This shame
Tried to make it go away
Almost lost life twice
What is with this love of self sacrifice

We formed a circle come to find that circles don't allow progress
