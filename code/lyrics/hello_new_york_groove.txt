Song:

It's been a year since I was here
On the street I'm just passing my time away
To the left and to the right a town of stone grows to the sky
And it's out of sight in a fading light here I am again in the city
With a fist full of dollars and baby you gotta believe:

I'm back
Back in the New York groove
I'm back
Back in the New York groove
I'm back in the New York groove. In the New York groove.

In the back of a Cadillac with a lady by my side
Tell you where I'll be stop at third and forty tree
Dance into the night
It's gonna be ectasy
This day was made for me.

I feel so good tonight who cares about tomorrow.

I'm back
Back in the New York groove. ..
