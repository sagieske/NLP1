Song:

Feel my fingerpaint
Color to stimulate ya
Rise relate ya
Passin over nature
Rhymes to break ya take ya
Up to the maker
Away from the pain we feeling safer
The liberator rectify the soul
Written in red, green, black trimmed with gold
We've been in war, 
Hey man we've seen it all before
Got you feelin the fundamentals of flow
Toe-to-toe holla battle
Creepin bout the shadow
? bring a barage of marshmellow, yellow
Burbs and words curse slip style mellow
Zion the lion hearted fellow, bellow
Fingerpaint, you can hold the weight
When the mind in great then the soul create
I reperate like I'm water when I change my state
Mindscape to the next levitate, (tate)

Breaking all the shit that I don't want to hold
Making all the song words inside me flow
Sowin all the seeds that can make me grow
And I'm breathin, I'm breathin slow
Breaking all the shit that I don't want to hold
Making all the song words inside me flow
Sowing all the seeds that can make me grow
And I'm breathin, I'm breathin slow

Breath in, out... 

Feel my fingerpaint as the world spins
Let my fingerpaint cleanse your sins
My fingers paintin all colors on your skin
See my reflection in my brother my twin
I'm sparkin a light to your soul deep within
You can hear the echo when I drop my pin
The children hold hands under the rainbow
Everywhere we go we bring the same flow
Feel my fingerpaint on my parabola
Supernovas, nebulas, satellites
My fingers paintin all over the mic
My fingers paintin lightning when it strikes
Bring down the rain, release the pain
Master the craft to die and rise again
My fingers paint across all terrain
My fingerpaint penetrate your brain... 

Breaking all the shit that I don't want to hold
Making all the song words inside me flow
Sowin all the seeds that can make me grow
And I'm breathin, I'm breathin slow
Breaking all the shit that I don't want to hold
Making all the song words inside me flow
Sowing all the seeds that can make me grow
And I'm breathin, I'm breathin slow

(Repeats over and over...)
