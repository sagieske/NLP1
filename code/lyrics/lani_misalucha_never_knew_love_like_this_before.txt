Song:

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

You are my lovelight, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're heart, part of me

Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
What a surprise

'Cause I never
Knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for

You are my sunlight and my rain
And time could never change
What we share forever more
Ooooh-whooooa

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never
Knew love like this before

You are my lovelight, this I know
And I'll never let you go
You my all, you're part of me
Once I was lost and now I'm found
And you turned my world around
When I need you, I call your name

'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never
Knew love like this before
Inside of me
(I never) never
Knew love like this before
Opened my eyes

(Never) never, (never) never
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew, I never knew
I never
(Never) never, (never) never
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew, I never knew
I never knew
(Never) never, (never) never
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew-whoooooa
(Never)
Never knew-whooooa
(Never) never
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew-whoooooa
(Never)
Never knew-whooooa
(Never) never
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew, I never knew
I never knew (never)
I never knew, I never knew
I never knew (never) I never
Never knew love like this
(Never knew love like this)
I never knew-whoooooa
(Never)
Never knew-whooooa
(Never) never
(Never knew love like this)
Opened my eyes
What a surprise
