Song:

Only You know my pain inside
You've been there when no one else could be
When tears fall from my eyes
I know that You are always there
No matter what's in my heart
You are the One who cares
When I doubt, You stand by me
So I'm not ashamed to say the way I feel
I love You, You are my Everything
