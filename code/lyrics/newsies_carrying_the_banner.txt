Song:

That's my cigar
You'll steal another
Hey bummers we got work to do
Since when did you become me mother
Ah stop your bawling
Hey, who asked you?!

Try Bottle Alley or the harbor
Try Central Park it's guaranteed
Try any bank or bum or barber
They almost all knows how to read!

I smell money
You smell foul
Met this girl last night
Move your elbow
Pass the towel
For a buck I might

Aint it a fine life
Carrying the banner through it all
A mighty fine life, carrying the banner tough and tall
Every morning we goes where we wishes
Wes as free as fishes
Sure beats washing dishes
What a fine life, carrying the banner home-free all

It takes a smile as sweet as butter
The kind that ladys can't resist
It takes an orphan with a stutter
Who aint afraid to use his fist

Summer stinks and winters waiting
Welcome to New York
Boy aint nature fascinating
When yous gotta walk

So it's a fine life carrying the banner with me chums
Its a fine life carrying the banner with me chums
A mighty fine life, blowin' every nickel as it falls
A mighty fine life, blowin' every nickel as it falls

I'm no snoozer
Sitting makes me ancy
I likes livin' chancy
Harlen to Delancey
What a fine life
Carrying the banner through the slums

Blessed children
Though you wander lost and depraved
Jesus loves you, you shall be safe

(The two next are sang together)

Patrick?
Darling?
Since you left me I am undone
Mother loves you, god save my son

Just gimme half a cup
Something to wake me up
I gotta find an angle
I gotta sell more papes
Papers is all I got
Wish I could catch a breeze
Sure hope the headline's hot
All I can catch is fleas
God, help me if it's not
Somebody help me, please

If I hate the headlines
I'll make up the headline
And I'll say anything I have to
'Cause at two for a penny
If I take too many
Weasel just makes me eat 'em after

Look! They're puttin' up the headline
What's it say
You call that a headline
That won't pay
I get better stories
From the copper on the beat
So where's your spot
I was gonna start at twenty
God, it's hot
Now a dozen'll be plenty
Will ya tell me
Tell me, how'm I gonna make ends meet

We need a good assassination
We need an earthquake or a war
How 'bout a crooked politician
Hey stupid that aint news no more
Uptown to Grand Central Station
Down to City Hall
We improves our circulation
Walking till we fall

(The next two are sung together)

Still we'll be out there
Carrying the banner man to man!
We'll be out there
Soakin' every sucker that we can!
See the headline:
Newsies on a mission!
Kill the competition
Sell the next edition
While we're out there
Carrying the banner is the

Look, they're puttin' up the headline
They call that a headline?
The idiot who wrote it
Must be workin' for the Sun!
Did ya hear about the fire?

(Next two sang together)

It's a fine life
Carrying the banner through it all
A mighty fine life
Carrying the banner tough and tall
See the headline
Newsies on a mission
Kill the competition
Sell the next edition
What a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a fine life
Carrying the banner
It's a
Go!

Would you look at that headline
You call that a headline
I get better stories
From the copper on the beat
I was gonna start with twenty
Now a dozen'll be plenty
Would you tell me how'm I ever
Gonna make ends meet
Hitched it on a trolley
Meetcha Forty-fourth and Second
Little Italy's a secret
Bleecker's further than I reckoned
By the courthouse
Near the stables
On the corner someone beckoned!
Go get 'em Cowboy
You got 'em now, boy
Go get 'em, Cowboy
You got 'em now, boy
Go!
