Song:

Dear Santa Claus, It's been so long
So long since I have written
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled
I've moved from there and now I live
On disillusion avenue
And I've been here longer than I care to tell.

The twinkling bells of hope and joy
The laughter that rang in my voice
Have silenced more and more as time goes by
Those treasured gifts from other years
Are tarnished, lost or stained with tears
So Santa would you bring a new supply.

Chorus:
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
My faith is gone, my courage low, my patience ran out long ago
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year.

(Spoken)
Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness
And the grudges that I've gathered through the years
And leave a large bag of forgiveness to give out to those
Who robbed me of my laughter that sometimes filled my
Eyes with tears and Santa please a box piled high with
Love and understanding that I could share with all my
Neighbors and my friends and leave one new temper
'Cause I lost mine, lost it one too many times and make
The new one longer if you can.

Chorus: (Sang)
I'll be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year.

(Spoken)
Please Santa fill my empty heart this year...
