Song:

You said we could make it-
Now this ships going down in flames.
Just because you didn't know where we were before-
That dosn't mean that I'm lost without you.
But you see... 
I'm not afraid to die-
Cause' when I do I'll end up at the right hand of God.
But you see... 
I'm not afraid to die-
I'm not afraid to die.
So lets dee how fast we can burn this thing to the ground.
Burn it down.
*Trust in Him.
Lean not on your own understanding.*
You can make it through the storm-
And it will only make you stronger.
It will only make you stronger.
You told me I wont feel a thing-
But now you wont be the one to stand in my way.
With all this hope in my heart I look to the sky
In need of love.
I can see the fear in your eyes, 
There's only hope if you give up your pride.
