Song:

Do what you do don't bring me down
I went to the doctor he's just another clown
Don't stand alone you might turn to stone
I wish there was a pill for that - you're on your own

Can't you see what it's doing to me
All I wanna be is by your side
I don't care if they cut my hair
All I wanna be is by your side

Shake me down you wanna put me on the ground
There's money in my pocket I won't make a sound
Run me over or pick a four leaf clover
Now they cut the lights down, this record's going slower

Can't you see what it's doing to me
All I wanna be is by your side
I don't care if they cut my hair
All I wanna be is by your side
