Song:

Know if gotta be something
It's lately everything wanna go dead
I know if gotta be something
It's lately everything's going my way

Get cough since you've taking that fault
I'm lose a focus before I lose it all
I could get fast this moment
Maybe I found my way outta this date

Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me

Know if gotta be something
It's lately everything wanna go dead
I know if gotta be something
It's lately everything's going my way

Get cough since you've taking that fault
I'm lose a focus before I lose it all
I could get fast this moment
Maybe I found my way outta this date

Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me

Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me
Everywhere I go
The black cloud over me
And it's keepin' me from blackin' out my over me
