Song:

Hey y'all you know what, we've never talked about love before, you know
Here's our version, check it out

Paint a pretty smile each day, lovin' is a blessing, yeah
Never let it fade away, it's all 'bout love, yeah
Build yourself a true romance, beauty that surround you, yeah
You deserve, just one more chance, my dear, my dear

Let the light shine all through your mind, feel your lil' heart aglow
Take the time, make up your mind, it's all 'bout love, yeah
Talking to yourself is fine, makes you feel much better
Know just where to draw the line, my dear, my dear, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, yeah
Let the light shine all through your mind, feel your lil' heart aglow
Take the time make up your mind, it's all 'bout love, yeah
Talking to yourself is fine, makes you feel much better
Know just where to draw the line, my dear, my dear

You know I'm bound to fall in love one day surely and you need it
Pretty smile will always say, it's all, about love
