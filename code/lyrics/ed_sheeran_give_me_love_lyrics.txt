Song:

Give me love like her, 'cause lately I've been waking up alone, Paint
Splattered teardrops on my shirt, Told you I'd let them go, And that I'll
Fight my corner, Maybe tonight I'll call ya, after my blood turns into
Alcohol, No I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me, or burn this out, We'll play hide and seek to
Turn this around, And all I want is the taste that your lips allow, My, my, 
My, my, oh give me love, my, my, my, my, oh give me love, My, my, my, my, 
Oh give me love, my, my, my, my, oh give me love, My, my, my, my, oh give
Me love.

Give me love like never before, 'cause lately I've been craving more, And
It's been a while but I still feel the same, Maybe I should let you go, You
Know I'll fight my corner, And that tonight I'll call ya, After my blood is
Drowning in alcohol, No I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me, or burn this out, We'll play hide and seek to
Turn this around, And all I want is the taste that your lips allow, my, my, 
My, my, Oh give me love, give a little time to me, or burn this out, We'll
Play hide and seek to turn this around, And all I want is the taste that
Your lips allow, My, my, my, my, oh give me love, my, my, my, my, oh give
Me love, my, my, my, my, oh give me love, my, my, my, my, oh give me love, 
My my, my, my, oh give me love.

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover, M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, 
Give me love, lover, M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover, M-my
