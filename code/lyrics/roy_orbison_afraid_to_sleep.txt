Song:

The night is still the wind is chilled 
I hear the rain falling on my window pane 
Can't close my eyes, afraid to sleep 
Cause when I do I would only dream of you 
I'm trying to forget that we ever met 
But how can I forget and dream of you? 
Afraid to sleep because I'd dream of you 
Afraid to sleep because I'd wake up feeling blue 
If I stay awake forever,we'd never be together 
So I'll close my eyes and go ahead and dream 
Sweet dreams 
Sweet dreams 
Sweer dreams....
