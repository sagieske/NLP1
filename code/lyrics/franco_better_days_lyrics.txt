Song:

Come hear Jah sound
Spreading good vibrations all over this town
Come right your wrongs for better days
Yeah ai

Put love in you
Put love in me
No matter what they do or say
We’ll be on our way

(Chorus)
The world is gonna see some better days
If healing starts within yourself today
Such a simple way a price to pay 
For better days

Herbal medication
Healing of the nation
Spreading good vibrations 
Yeah yeah ai

So learn how to be cool
From heating up too soon
So may I 

Give love to you
Give love to me
No matter what they do or say
We’ll be on our way

(Chorus)
The world is gonna see some better days
If healing starts within yourself today
Such a simple way a price to pay 
For better days

The brightness and positive rays of Jah sun
It's calling us, calling us everyone

The waves and the surf that provide us the fun
It's calling us
It's calling us

We’ll be warm
Under the sun
Hope for better days to come

(Chorus)
The world is gonna see some better days
If healing starts within yourself today
Such a simple way a price to pay 
For better days

The world is gonna see some better days
If healing starts within ourselves today
Such a simple way a price to pay 
For better days
