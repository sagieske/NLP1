Song:

I tried so hard to be her day
But the night has already taken me away
Shedding dreams under the maple tree
Where I carved your name
(Your name)
Nothing left, not even time
Straight reads the line
His life had reached the end
Wanting only to be loved by adrienne
Letters explained his grief
But she would never read
His wrists would bleed
But she would never see
So he took his life at the age of 23
And she had always loved him
But he would never know
For she covered her love
Like stars cover the sky
Hiding her heart
Fearing what he would find inside
A widow she reamained
Holding him deep inside
Wishing she too would die
Holding him deep inside
Wishing she too would die
Time favors no one and if we wait
We too can fall in love
A second too late
