Song:

(Jeffrey Steele/Craig Wiseman)

Oh, c'mon, let it go.

He was an underdog; a no threat;
A nascar jockey, a rookie; a wannabe.
Still wet behind the ears,
A red-line revver just a-jammin' his gears.
There are those that are, an' those that ain't.
The quickest get stickers,
He was nothin' but paint.
Chartreuse paint.

Big race, now we cut to, the last ten laps:
Here comes Junior, sneakin' up
From the back of the pack, with fire in his eyes;
Wavin' out the window as he passes 'em by.
The tension mounts: now he's number two;
All out of rubber an' runnin' on fumes.
It's door to door, outta turn four:
He sees those chequers an' he hears that roar.

An' the crowd goes wild.
An' the crowd goes wild.
You're shinin' like a superstar, baby,
An' the crowd goes wild.

He played the honky-tonks, the roadside bars,
A real humdinger; a blue-eyed singer.
With a red guitar arund his neck.
Payin' them dues by starvin' to death.
But he told his Momma every time he come back,
"One of these days I'm gonna buy you, a big long Cadillac.
"An' get you outta this shack."

Then he hit the road, frontin' the band.
Six long hairs bobbin' up an' down,
In a Chevy van, all beat up;
He did a lotta givin' but he never gave up.
Then one night, he wrote a song.
Made a little record; started catchin' on.
Now it's coliseums, he's all the rage:
The lights go down when he hits the stage

An' the crowd goes wild.
An' the crowd goes wild.
You're shinin' like a superstar, baby,
An' the crowd goes wild.

(You're shinin' like a superstar, baby.)
Whooa. Yeah!

Go boy!

Yeah, the crowd goes wild.
An' the crowd goes wild.
You're shinin' like a superstar, baby,
An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar, baby.)
An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar.)

An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar, baby.)
An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar.)

An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar, baby.)
An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar.)

An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar, baby.)
An' the crowd goes wild.
(You're shinin' like a superstar.)
