[Intro:]
I don't know what to do
She's all I've ever wanted
I'mma have to let this feeling go
Because I can't have her
It's killing me

I never wanted anything in this world
As much as I want you, mmm
>From the first moment I saw you
I felt my heart yearning
But I know you gotta man
And you love him real strong
He claims he loves you too
But I know
That he don't love you like I do

And I can't help the way I feel
Everyday it gets so hard to deal
The one I love so much, don't feel the same about me
Gotta let it be

1 - I keep tellin' myself, better walk on
Leave well enough alone
Better find a woman of my own

Keep on tellin' myself I can't make her my very own
Leave well enough alone
Better move on

Only know your man by seeing him with you
Respect forces me not to pursue
Don't worry
Steppin' out of line, I will never do
I pray that one day
You'll have a change of heart
(I promise we'll never part, oh no)
You'll be cherished by me like a work of art

I just can't hold what's inside
My foolish pride won't let me hide
Can't stop my love
'Cause you are my destiny

Repeat 1

But you love someone else
Why'd you have to love someone else baby?
Mmm mm mm
I need something to know

And I can't help the way I feel
Everyday, it gets so hard to deal
Can't stop my love
'Cause you are my destiny
Hey, hey, hey

Repeat 1 to fade
