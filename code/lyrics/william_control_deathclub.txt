Song:

The sinners crying
We're dressed like fame
The shame of knowing the guilty
The killer instinct to play this game
I know we're nothing but filthy

You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange
You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange

We're in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Membership is pain
Were in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Silent, damned and strange

Mindless follow the velvet tears
The silent picture is perfect
The architects of our flaws and fears
I know, were nothing but servants

You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange
You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange

We're in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Membership is pain
Were in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Silent, damned and strange

Take away the fear and I'll follow
Take me half alive
I'm not running scared tomorrow
Oh I'll survive

You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange
You're in the Deathclub, melt so strange

We're in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Membership is pain
Were in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Silent, damned and strange

We're in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Membership is pain
Were in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Silent, damned and strange

We're in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Membership is pain
Were in the Deathclub
All free to sin away
Take your own life
Silent, damned and strange
