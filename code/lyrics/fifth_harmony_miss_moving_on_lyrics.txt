Song:

[Camila]
I’m breaking down; gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an Etch-A-Sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

[Lauren]
I’m not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
You killed me, but I survived
And now I’m coming alive

[Camila]
I’ll never be that girl again
No-oh-oh
I’ll never be that girl again
No-oh-oh

[Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
[All (Lauren leads)]
Miss Movin’ On
Oh-oh-oh
Miss Movin’ On
Oh-oh-oh
[Lauren]
Yeah

[Lauren]
I broke the glass that surrounded me ([Normani:] Surrounded me)
I ain’t the way you remember me ([Normani:] Remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile, but no more.

[Dinah]
I jumped the fence to the other side ([Normani:] The other side)
My whole world was electrified ([Normani:] Elecrified)
Now I’m no longer afraid
It’s Independence Day
[Normani]
It's Independence Day

[Camila]
I’ll never be that girl again
No-oh-oh
I’ll never be that girl again
No-oh-oh

[Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
[All (Lauren leads)]
Miss Movin’ On

[Dinah]
Everything is changing and I never wanna go back to the way it was (the way it was)
I’m finding who I am and who I am from here on out is gonna be enough (gonna be enough)
It’s gonna be enough

[Normani]
I’ll never be that girl again
No-oh-oh
[Ally]
I’ll never be that girl again
Oh-oh-oh

[All]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
[All (Lauren leads)]
Miss Movin’ On (oooon)
Oh-oh-oh
Miss Movin’ On (on and on and on and on and on)
Oh-oh-oh
Miss Movin’ On (on and on and on and on)
Oh-oh-oh (on and on and on and on)
Miss Movin’ On
Oh-oh-oh (hey, yeah, yeah)
[Lauren]
I'm movin' on
