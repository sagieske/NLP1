Are you ready, Eddie, to turn out rock-and-roll?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, ready to rock-and-roll?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, to give me some of your soul?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]

Are you ready, Eddie, to pull those faders down?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, to pull those faders down?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, to turn your scully round?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]

Are you ready, Eddie, to pull those faders down?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, to pull those faders down?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, to turn your scully round?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]

Well, are you ready, Eddie, to turn your sixteen tracks on?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie, with your sixteen tracks?
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]
Are you ready, Eddie? A bit of vibing is all it lacks.
[Eddie edit, Eddie, Eddie edit]

Well, vibe me Eddie, vibe me all night long?
[Vibe me, Eddie, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddie]
Vibe me, Eddie, vibe me all night long.
[Vibe me, Eddie, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddie]
While you're vibing me, Eddie, nothing can go wrong.
[Vibe me, Eddie, Vibe me, vibe me, Eddie]
