Song:

It was a rainy day and I just got to thinking
Of how our lives had changed with all the years

This room was once alive with all your laughter
And when I heard the silence I called you right away
Now please don't say a word hear what I say

Love me like the first time again
Lets pretend that it's never gonna end
For one last night
Just hold me in the way you used to do
You know, love me like the first time and go

Is it my imagination are you lonely
Well I'm sorry but I thought you're sounding sad
I'm not trying to start a fire again please listen
If you're free at all tomorrow the next day who knows when
For the last time can we say goodbye as friends

Repeat 2x

Oh love me like the first time again
Lets pretend it's never gonna end
For one last night
Just hold me in the way you used to do
You know, love me like the first time and go
