[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I be riding through the park like I'm A-Rod
Walking through the park like I'm A-Rod
Smoking on that strong, that's that steroid
They tryna kick me out like A-Rod
I used to run the base like A-Rod
When I get me a check, I'ma buy me some extra
When I get me a check, I'ma buy me a necklace
When I get me a check, I'ma eat her for breakfast
When I get me a check, n****s gotta respect it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod, worth 25 mill
That's a whole lot of money, man somebody get killed
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
We need us a doctor, for drinkinl the vodka
That pi√±a colada, I might s**t a lobster
I just said that s**t with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
Cui n***a, watch I get to it
Cui n***a, the chopper under influence
Now watch how I limp to the bank, dreads hanging under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 n***a from the south side, I need a spot light
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and f**k her like it's prom night

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Move around my town like A-Rod
Playing with that girl like Baywatch, Tony Hawk skate off
Steriod, on your a** like Hemorrhoids, cash out with that pen boy
Your pass out see the invoice
When I get that check, I'ma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house
You can smoke and you can drink and bend it over and let me play
God dammit I came up, n***a
35K take the plane up, n***a
35 cars, 35 chains, n***a
Gettin' this change, never changed up, n***a
When I get me a check, I'ma buy you a fake a**
With your fake a**, we don't count money, weigh cash
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash
When you're talkin' 'bout work, was my day job
Playin' with the base like A-Rod
Playin' with the [?] since yay high
Mix it up, drink it, stay high

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
