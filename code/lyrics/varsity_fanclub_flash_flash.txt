Flash flash, snap snap
Flash flash, snap snap
There's no doubt about it
I hit the streets, they're watching me
If the scene is crowded
They know that's where I'm gonna be
What's the deal with the shouting
It's almost like they're stalking me
Sneaking down an alley
Why can't you get away from me

I don't know just what you saying 'bout me
I don't care, 'cause you don't even know me

Gotta watch my back, back
When I hear the snap, snap
Running from the flash, flash
The paparazzi, they think they caught me
Doing bad, bad
I ain't down with that that
Stunnas with the hat, hat
Save me from the flash flash, snap snap

Flash flash, snap snap
Flash flash, snap snap

Stop it, I wont have it
The rumors keep on surfacing
As you're looking at it
In all your stupid magazines
I can't do this no more
You keep bad mouthing me
Privacy is all I need
Why can't you get way from me

I don't know just what you're saying 'bout me
I don't care, 'cause you don't even know me

Gotta watch my back, back
When I hear the snap, snap
Running from the flash, flash
The paparazzi, they think they
Caught me doing bad, bad
I ain't down with that that
Stunnas with the hat, hat
Save me from the flash flash, snap snap

Keep a distance from me
You call me out on everything
What you getting from it
Your drama made so easily
(I don't really 'cause you don't know me)
Don't get up in my face
When I try to walk away

(Flash flash, snap snap)
When the flash goes
(Flash flash, snap snap)
When the flash goes
When the flash goes
Yeahhh

Gotta watch my back, back
When I hear the snap, snap
Running from the flash, flash
The paparazzi, they think they caught me
Doing bad, bad
I ain't down with that that
Stunnas with the hat, hat
Save me from the flash flash, snap snap

Gotta watch my back, back
When I hear the snap, snap
Running from the flash, flash
The paparazzi, they think they
Caught me doing bad, bad
I ain't down with that that
Stunnas with the hat, hat
Save me from the flash flash snap snap

Ohhh
Flash flash, snap snap
Flash flash, snap snap
