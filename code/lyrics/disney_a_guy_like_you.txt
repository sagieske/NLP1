Song:

Paris, the city of lovers is glowing this evening
True, that's because it's on fire
But still, there's 'l'amour'
Somewhere out there in the night
Her heart is also alight
And I know the guy she just might be burning for

A guy like you, she's never known, kid
A guy like you, a girl does not meet every day
You've got a look, that's all your own, kid
Could there be two? Like you? No way

Those other guys that she could dangle
All look the same from every boring point of view
You're a surprise from every angle
Mon Dieu above, she's gotta love a guy like you

A guy like you gets extra credit
Because it's true you've got a certain some thing more
You're aces, kid, you see that face, you don't forget it
Want something new? That's you, for sure

We all have gaped at some Adonis
But then we crave a meal more nourishing to chew
And since you've shaped like a croissant is
No question of she's gotta love a guy like you

Call me a hopeless romantic but Quasi, I feel it
She wants you so, any moment she'll walk through that door
For a guy so swell, a guy like you with all you bring her
A fool could tell, it's why she fell, for you know who

You ring the bell, you're the bell ringer!
When she wants oo, la, la, then she wants you la, la
She will discover, guy, you're one heckuva guy
Who wouldn't love a guy like you

You got a lot, so she's gotta love a guy like you
