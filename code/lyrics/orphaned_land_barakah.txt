Song:

This is a resistance dispatch.
Codeword: Illumination
The one shall stand against the horde
From the underground we take hold
Power is word, power is sword
Legion are we all this day – blessed with second sight
The violin was played, as Rome was set aflame
Shall the grief of war forever be the same?
Banners must be raised for hope has to prevail
Oars to the water, to a promised land we sail
Divided we shall fall – to stand we must unite
Give us your blessing Barakah
