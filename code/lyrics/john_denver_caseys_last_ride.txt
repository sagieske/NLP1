Casey joins the hallow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
Of silent desperation never speaking to a soul

The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dying
Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstyle and the rattle of his chain

Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you
Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while

Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything thay can to keep from going home

Standing in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passin' by
And he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye

Oh she said, I suppose you seldom think about me
Now she said, now that you've a family of your own
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body
Lord she said, Casey it's a shame to be alone

Oh she said, Casey it's been so long since I've seen you
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile
See she said, I put on new stockings just to please you
Lord she said, Casey can you only stay a while
Lord she said, Casey it's a shame to be alone
