Song:

These days it's hard to find
Someone to love
Once you find them
You don't want to give up

And now I know that we're
Both alone in this
It's just me and you
Against the world

And there's me
And there's you
It's just me and you 
Against the world

(Oh girl)

And, what am I supposed to do
The alarms are going off in my head
And It's dangerous
Yes It's complicated

We're the only ones who get it
The only ones that want this
The only ones who believe
In love

It's just the two of us
Getting into love
It take two of us
To change the world

I've got you
You've got me
It's just me and you
Against the world

Girl, you got me so crazy in longing
And I know it's wrong but so right

And I'm holding you
I have been dreaming
And I can't let you go
Now, you're mine

Girl, what am I supposed to do
The alarms are going off in my head

It's just the two of us 
Getting into love
It takes two of us 
To change the world

I got you
You got me
It's just me and you
Against the world

It's just the two of us
Getting into love
It takes two of us
To change the world
