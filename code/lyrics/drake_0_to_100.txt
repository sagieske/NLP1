[Verse:]
F**k being on some chill s**t
We got 0 to 100 n***a, real quick
They be on that rap to pay the bill s**t
And I don't feel that s**t, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth n***a
My actions been louder than my words n***a
How you sold albums, still so down to Earth, n***a
If n****s wanna do it, we can do it ya turf n***a
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the b*****s out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some s**t that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This s**t a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the f**k them n****s is, boy?
Ovo, man we really with the s***s, boy
Really with the s***s
I should prolly sign a Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
F**k all that "Drake you gotta chill" s**t
I be on my Lil Mouse drill s**t
F**k all that rap-to-pay-your-bill s**t
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors pay my bills s**t
All up on tv, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that s**t, don't want to make him sicker
That's my n***a
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billi's, n***a
Don't make me kill one of the goat's for it
Ugh, I run this s**t, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, n***a, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... F**k that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you n****s and do it for myself

[Hook:]
I go 0 to 100, n***a, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real s**t
0 to 100, n***a, real quick
Real quick, real fu***n' quick, n***a
0 to 100, n***a, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real s**t
0 to 100, n***a, real quick
Real quick, real fu***n' quick, n***a

[Part ii: The Catch Up]

[Bridge:]
Whole squad on that real s**t
The whole squad on that real s**t

[Verse 2:]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another n***a at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I can see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften it
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as much as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
Pnd droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', ob droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, f**k how I was in the past tense
Ask himself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

[Outro: James Blake] x16
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
