Song:

After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
And when the dancin' is through and folks will be through
I'll be sitting with no one but you
And I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low

I wanna hold you and squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you and please you and make you understand
And when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a real good time

After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so, baby
And when we cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I got somethin' sweet I want you to hear
And I'll be needin' you so, after the lights go down low
After the lights go down low

I wanna hold you and squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you and please you and make you understand
And when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a swingin' time

After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
Now listen, when we cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I got some sweet talk that you wanna hear

And I'll be needin' you so, after the lights go down low
And I'll be needin' you so, after the lights go down low
And I'll be needin' you so, after the lights go down low
And I'll be needin' you so, after the lights go down low
