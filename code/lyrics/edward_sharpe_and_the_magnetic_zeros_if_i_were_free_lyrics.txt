Song:

If I were free
I would run into battles with flowers and hugs
And bow at the boots of our well-oiled thugs
Yes, if I were free

If it were me
I would yell out "I love you!" to all I passed
I would disrobe and disco and rip off my mask

Yes, if I were free I'd be the 'u' that crossed the 'i' to simply 'b'
Minding our reflections at the bottom of the sea
What did you see?

I saw that you and I forever have been free
The light became too heavy and I fell into a dream
What did you dream?

I dreamed a wind that would sweep
Every castle made of sand
Out across the old far holy land
Oh, if this were free

If this were free
We'd be free of the terror of the graves
And fear masquerading as the brave
Oh, if this were free

I woke upon a pig of red, white and blue
The circus got too heavy so we fell into the zoo
What did you feel?

I felt the fear that every q**** does in his head
First thing to starting over, I made sure I was dead
What did you dream?

Swimming with ancients, laughing, tired of getting lost
We took our left, remember, when we leaned upon the cross
What did you see?

I saw that you and I forever have been free
The light became too heavy and we fell into a dream
