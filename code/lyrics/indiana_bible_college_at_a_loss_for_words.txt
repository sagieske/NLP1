Song:

[Verse:]
You speak
Iâ€™m at a loss for words
You breathe
My very soul is stirred
Deep calls to deep
Draw near to me
Deep calls to deep
Draw near to me

[Chorus:]
My soul
Cries out in worship
With hands lifted high
I surrender
My soul
Cries out in worship
With hands lifted high
I surrender
Giving my all
Giving my all
Giving my all
To you

[Verse 2:]
You stretch forth Your hand
And I am touched
Your loving arms reach out
And I am undone
Deep calls to deep
Draw near to me
Deep calls to deep
Draw near to me

[Bridge:]
Deep calls to deep

[Outro:]
My soul
Cries out in worship
With hands lifted high
I surrender
My soul
With hands lifted high
I surrender
