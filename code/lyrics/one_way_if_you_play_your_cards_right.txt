Song:

Something on your mind
I feel it every time I'm with you
It's what you like to do, something I like to
Let's get it tight

If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me

You won't have to hide what you feel inside
Can't be afraid to talk to me
Love is guaranteed
You play them right with me and you will see

If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me

If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me

If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me

If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me
If you play your cards right
Everything will be alright with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

If you play your cards right
Everything's gonna be alright
If you play your cards right with me

It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
