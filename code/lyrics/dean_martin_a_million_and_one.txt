Song:

(How many teardrops) have I cried over you
A million and one tears a million and two
(How many nighttimes' have my arms ached to you
A million and one nights a million and two

Lovin' you darling while I thought you loved me only me
But you were just fooling and the fool you were fooling was me
How many sweet dreams will never come true
A million and one dreams a million and two

(Lovin' you darling while I thought you loved me only me)
But you were just fooling and the fool you were fooling was me
(How many sweet dreams) oh will never come true
A million and one dreams a million and two
A million and one dreams a million and two
