Song:

(Nanci Griffith)

I saw you on the avenue
You looked so tired and a little blue
You were in your Sunday best
With your father's tie upon your chest

Chorus
Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

In the corridor of one hotel
We once crossed paths I recall it well
Voices in an empty hall
Slamming doors to hearts that fall

Chorus

Always will always will
Hey
Always will always will
Hey

Love has been my passer by
I stood too still to catch your eye
But there out on the avenue
In your father's tie I'll remember you

Chorus

Hey, you always will
