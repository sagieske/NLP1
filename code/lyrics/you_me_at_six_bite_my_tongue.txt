Song:

I hate to break it to you
But you're just a lonely star
I try to bring you down but
Our level isn't good enough
You always do as you believe so
I'm gonna follow suit
And take a seat
I'll watch you fall apart
Cause in the end what are you without me
I'll slow this down cause I know that you can't keep up
Oh maybe I maybe I was wrong from the start
I might be proud but least I'm proud of something
You've taken pride in becoming nothing

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

I'm married to the music
For better or for worse
You say that I'm privileged but
My gift is my curse
I can't recall the last time
Someone asked me how I was
Last I checked I was a f*****g wreck
I called for help and no one showed up
So I'll sit in the dirt

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me

[Oli Sykes]
Just forget what you've learned
Just forget what you've heard
The truth just confirmed
I can't bare the sight of you anymore
You've become what I hate
Sold yourself for a bit of fame
Now the wolves have closed the doors
Wanna drag me down for more
F**k you
F**k you

You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
You keep me on the edge of my seat
I bite my tongue so you don't hear me
I wanna hate every part of you in me
I can't hate the ones who made me
