Song:

Hey
There's a hero,
If you look inside your heart,
You don't have to be afraid of what you are.

There's an answer,
If you reach into your soul,
And the sorrow that you know will melt away.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

It's a long road,
When you face the world alone,
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold,

You can find love,
When you search within yourself,
And the emptiness you felt will disappear.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.

Ooh
Lord knows,
Dreams are hard to follow,
You don't let anyone take them away,
Hold on,
There will be tomorrow,
In time you'll find the way.

And then a hero comes along,
With the strength to carry on,
And you cast your fears aside,
And you know you can survive.
So when you feel that hope is gone,
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth,
That a hero lies in you.
That a hero lies in you.
Ooh
That a hero lies in you.
