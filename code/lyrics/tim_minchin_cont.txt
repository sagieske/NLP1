Song:

I don't like Jews
Neither should you
They're ethically and spiritually poor, that's a fact

I don't like black people
It's just not acceptable
There should be some kind of law, that is that

And I get the s***s
With Inuits
They get on my t***, the little b******s

And women
Just make me so mad
Does that make me bad, am I bad?
Is that bad?

And the fu***n' Italians
I just cannot stand them
They really inspire my rancour
Cheating f*****g Italian wankers!

And lesbians and the bicurious
Make me furious
It's not their fault, I know, but still... Grr!

And fu***n' Christians
I just want to punch them in their faces

And I'm not comfortable with Muslims on the tube
And I can't stand publicly breast-feeding mothers

And I hate gays who talk camply
And the fu***n' Chinese make me angry

I hate the rich
I hate the poor
I hate b*****s
I hate whores

I hate Africans
I hate Japanese
I hate the disabled
I hate Burmese

Yeah, I don't care about your color or your creed
I will judge you for no reason

[At this point, Tim "realises" that he's made a mistake: "f**k, Sorry.
That's the trouble with trying out new stuff, it's... I had half the lyrics
Covered up. I think we should probably do it again. I think if we leave it
There I might run the risk of being misconstrued. It's not even called
'Cont', it called 'Context'. "]

[The song begins again]

I don't like Jews
Who make and distribute kiddy p***
Neither should you
They're ethically and spiritually poor, that's a fact

I don't like black people
Who risk billions of other peoples' money gambling on future derivatives
It's just not acceptable
There should be some kind of law, that is that

And I get the s***s
With Inuits
Who find out what job I do
And regale me with a racist joke or two
They get on my t***, the little b******s

And women
Who judge other women for not holding the some views as them vis-a-vis
Career and mothering
Just make me so mad
Does that make me bad, am I bad?
Is that bad?

And the fu***n' Italians
I just cannot stand them
When they take a dive in the penalty box
Denying Australia it's World Cup spot
They really inspire my rancour
Cheating f*****g Italian wankers

And lesbians and the bicurious
Make me furious
When their pride parade blocked the traffic flow
When my baby had asthma and had to go to the hospital
It's not their fault, I know, but still... Grr!

And fu***n' Christians
Who lean on their horn when my wife is being cautious at an intersection
I just want to punch them in their faces
Although my anger is fleeting
I understand their frustration
She's a little too hesitant

And I'm not comfortable Muslims on the tube
Who look over my shoulder when I'm readin'
And I can't stand publicly breast-feeding mothers
Who smoke cigarettes while they're feeding

And I hate gays who talk camply
During the final act of King Lear
And the fu***n' Chinese make me angry
When they make sham erection potions out of the horns of endangered
Rhinoceros

I hate the rich who use their wealth as an excuse for bigotry
I hate the poor who use their poverty as an excuse for bigotry
I hate b*****s who get rabies and try to bite babies
I hate whores who won't accept Visa

I hate African racists
I hate Japanese homophobes
I hate those disabled rapists
I hate Burmese cats

Yeah, I don't care about your colour or your creed
I will judge you for no reason...
But your deeds
