[Spoken]
Let me talk to em
I guess you know you made it
When they start talking bout you, right?
Welcome to fame
Ya'll don't pay me no mind,
I just gotta get some stuff off my chest
Listen

Young, energetic, famous
But don't really sweat it
Rich enough, fairly hot
So basically s** is not:
Dif-fi-cult to get
That ain't my fault, naw naw
Listen

And just cuz I might take
Advantage once or twice
People tell me I'm not right,
Thinking that s** was my life
But that just ain't it
So let me clear it for those
Who have obviously
Misread the code
Listen to me now

No
I am
Not
I'm not ad-dict-ed to s**
But girl I guarantee that
If you lay with me
You just might be

No
I am
Not
I'm not ad-dict-ed to s**
But girl I guarantee that
If you lay with me
You just might be yeah

I wanna 'pologize
For bein just a little freaky
I can't help it, it's just sin
But a problem it is not
I'm just fine y'all
Don't worry bout me
Listen

And I wanna 'pologize
For bein blessed with
The ability to satisfy accurately
And quickly find the spot
It's a gift and a curse
Don't mess around
Find my number
In your girlfriend's purse

No
I am
Not
I'm not addicted to s**
But girl I guarantee
That if you lay with me
You just might be

No
I am
Not
I'm not addicted to s**
But girl I guarantee
That if you lay with me
You just might be

I never been shy
Bout my self and sexuality
Never been taboo
(Never been taboo but if I)
Have to live without
I know it's something I could do
But I just really don't want to

No
I am
Not
I'm not addicted to s**
But girl I guarantee
That if you lay with me
You just might be

No
I am
Not
I'm not addicted to s**
But girl I guarantee
That if you lay with me
You just might be
