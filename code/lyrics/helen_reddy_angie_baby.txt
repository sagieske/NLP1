Song:

You live your life in the songs you here
On your rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
It's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched you know
Angie baby
Lovers appear in your room each night
As they whirl accross the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more angie baby
Chorus
Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well maybe
Stopping at her house is a neighbour boy
With evil on his mind
Cos he's been peeking in angies room
At the night through the window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Won't you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie baby
(angie baby) (angie baby)
When he walks in the room
He feels confused
Like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud
It spins him around
Till his soul has lost it's way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
No more the radio is bound
Never to be found
The headlines read that a boy disapeared
And everyone thinks he died
Except a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps him satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asked you to explain
Radio by your side
Angie baby
Chorus
Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well maybe
Well maybe
Well maybe
Well maybe
