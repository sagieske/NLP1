Song:

(billy joe faster/lee ann womack/jason sellers)

You're the life of the party
You stand out in a crowd
When I think of all the things you've done
It always makes me proud
But tonight I'm feeling empty
It seems I'm always here alone
Am I the only thing you've done wrong

Am I the only one that you've forgotten on the way
To gain the world and lose our love
Is to high a price to pay
In your long line of successes
Tell me where do I belong
Am I the only thing you've done wrong

You got another big promotion
You're the best man on the crew
When you set your mind on something
There's nothing you can't do
This house you built is perfect
We're the envy of the town
But lord it's lonley here when you're not around

Am I the only one that you've forgotten on the way
To gain the world and lose our love
Is to high a price to pay
In your long line of successes
Tell me where do I belong
Am I the only thing you've done wrong

Oh am I the only thing you've done wrong
