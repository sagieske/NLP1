Song:

Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Be my husband, I'll be your wife
Outside you there is no place to go.

If you want me to I'll cook and sew
If you want me to I'll cook and sew
If you want me to I'll cook and sew
Outside you there is no place to go.

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good

Please don't treat me so doggone mean
Please don't treat me so doggone mean
Please don't treat me so doggone mean
Youre the meanest man I ever seen

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good

Stick to the promise man, that you made me
Stick to the promise man, that you made me
Stick to the promise man, that you made me
That you'll stay away from Rosalie

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
