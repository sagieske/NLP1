Song:

One Love!
One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right.
Hear the children cryin'
(One Love! );
Hear the children cryin'
(One Heart! ),
Sayin': give thanks and praise
To the Lord and I will feel all right;
Sayin': let's get together
And feel all right.
Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

Let them all pass all their dirty
Remarks (One Love! );
There is one question
I'd really love to ask (One Heart! ):
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner,
Who has hurt all mankind just
To save his own beliefs?

One Love! What about the one heart?
One Heart!
What about?
Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning
(One Love! );
So shall it be in the end
(One Heart! ),
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let's get together
And feel all right.
One more thing!

Let's get together to fight
This Holy Armagiddyon (One Love! ),
So when the Man comes there will be no,
No doom (One Song! ).
Have pity on those whose
Chances grows t'inner;
There ain't no hiding place
From the Father of Creation.

Sayin': One Love!
What about the One Heart?
(One Heart! )
What about the?
Let's get together and feel all right.
I'm pleadin' to mankind!
(One Love! );
Oh, Lord!
(One Heart)
Wo-ooh!

Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let's get together and feel all right.
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel all right;
Let's get together and feel all right.
