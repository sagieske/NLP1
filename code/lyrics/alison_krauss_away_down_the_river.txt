Song:

Baby dry your eyes
There's no need to cry
Cause I'll see you again
It might be a while
Before you understand

[Chorus:]
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more
Crossing over Jordan
To the other shore
I'll be standing waiting
With all who've gone before
I'm just away down the river
A hundred miles or more

Now the pictures on the wall
Will help you to recall
They're not there
To make you sad
But to remember
All the good times we had

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

When it's time to leave
You're gonna feel the mountain breeze
And the snow will fill the stream
And carry you to me

[Chorus]
