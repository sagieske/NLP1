Song:

Ten years ago
I fell in love with an Irish girl
She took my heart

But she went and screwed some guy she knew
And now I'm in Dublin with a broken heart

Oh broken hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy
Oh broken hearted Hoover fixer sucker, sucker guy

One day I'll go there and win her once again
But until then I'm just a sucker of a guy
