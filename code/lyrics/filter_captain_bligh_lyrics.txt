Song:

I'll give you one good tiny reason I think you could believe
I'll give you one good tiny reason I think you could see through it
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the truth could hurt me
I'm not the kind of man that thinks the truth can see me
You know a little bit goes a long way
You know a little bit lasts a long time

And the time has come to undo the wrong i've done

I am a grieving man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
And I can't believe the things I've done to you

I give you one good tiny reason to push that big suit too far
I give you one good tiny reason to smash him and his big car
Everybody thinks I'm blue and what everybody thinks is true
Yeah
Just can't go it in stride
So you think it's you
So you think it's true
You know a little bit lasts a long time
You know a little bit goes a long way

And the time has come to undo the wrong Ive done

ANd I am a grieving man
I can;t believe the things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you

And I am a blood soaked man
And I can't believe the things I've done to you
I am a guilty man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
And I am a grieving man
I can't believe hte things I've done to you
I am a beaten man
I can't believe the things I've done to you
(unintelligable gibberish)

I tried to pray
I tried to pray
I tried to pray
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
Yes I will give it a shot
Shot Shot
