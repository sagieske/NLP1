Song:

Here"I've just lost a lifetime
I have just lost my mind
So Mr World look after that girl
The one that I just left behind at 24 Sycamor
Where did my baby go?
Who's gonna mend my rainbow?
Who's gonna separate all the swimming around,
Back there on the ground
Flowing right under the gate of 24 Sycamor
Where did my baby go?
Windows black, watched me crying and they said
It's all over, you have lost her
Why don't you run away?
What could I say? I said,
Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain
She gone
My life is done, it's ended
Just one more thing to
I'll take a last look and then close the book
On someone that I once knew at 24 Sycamor
Where did my baby go?
Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain
She gone and I say
(fading)
Where's the hand that I used to hold?
Once so warm but tonight so cold
Now she's gone we both must share the pain
