Song:

Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on
Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on

Right, it’s cne right
Reppin the east, right
Reppin the rock, right
Coming straight off the block

Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop
Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop

Wherever I go, best believe I got my forty
Rolling down the stylish peak to get a little sporty
Bringing the city blue, I ‘ma pittin’ is slurry shorty
Saying hi now, girl, tryna get a little naughty

Get their number call up, kinda just make up a plan
Five minutes to wait to till each day, man I’m coming
You know me, you know the lady that they stunning
A chasin’ chain, do your thing because nothing

Once again, the Benz, the cd lens
To see all I say them gp in the France
Party till we end, these ends never end
Counting dollars, popping bottles
From beginning to the end

How we do keep it true, vip for the birds, n***a
When from the burns play that drums sick to serve
Keep the gangsta, never been a stranger to danger
24 7 I got my pay him off, back to here, here we go

Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on
Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on

Right, it’s cne right
Reppin the east, right
Reppin the rock, right
Coming straight off the block

Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop
Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop

Six in the morning, don’t stop
N***a, we lend the night to the cops
Chicks spilling their asses, Chris fillin’ their glasses
Lot of women in here but they, squad their planets

Where they go? Right here
Which one? Right here
Nice hair, nice gear
Nike, nice square

As she still wait for me to get up in the air
Now she bottle a spot and get with me and my pair
They know we get it down, every time we come around, yeah
She’s standin' nine block away, hear the sounds play

Still get a key, hear the clock get you pouncin’
N****s throw round here, so we still grounded

Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on
Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on

Right, it’s cne right
Reppin the east, right
Reppin the rock, right
Coming straight off the block

Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop
Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop

Call for life, now who you call for the ice
I ain’t calling you wife, I get it all overnight
So I’m gonna hate this b*****s, I said get off my pipe
Unless they all wanna bite, tell them they all go the light

Yeah, we all go the wuz, man, we all got that ice
Yeah, we all got them bites, yeah they kill you for bite
If the law wanna ask, running on to the light
N***a sharp as the night with name marking us right

Say to market a plan this time around it’s craze
Send it over with the homies, they will cater to the ladies
We getting crazy now, Jaret, Jake, these babies
Turn that beef to white sheets if you have a child to play

Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on
Here we go, here we go
Come on, come on

Right, it’s cne right
Reppin the east, right
Reppin the rock, right
Coming straight off the block

Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop
Ain’t no party like the yg party
‘Cause the yg party don’t stop
