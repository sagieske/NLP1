Song:

What do I got to do to my love to make you understand me
Where do I find the piece of your heart to keep you satisfied
What do I got to do to my love to make you even notice
Where do I find the words in my mouth to cut through the air tonight

Cause every day I know that I am learning
And age it ain't the only thing in life
But if memory's all you have then I can't find you
Beneath those eyes

So we open up the door
Let the music take you further than before
We open up the door
Cause maybe there's an angel standing on the porch

How do I face the man that I am when my heart's still in hiding
Staring me down, the days of my life that I've gotta justify
Maybe I need the cracks in my skin, emotions are hard to carry
Maybe I need the strength in your eyes to cut through the morning time

Cause every day I know that I am learning
And age it ain't the only thing in life
But if memory's all you have then I can't find you beneath those eyes

So we open up the door
Let the music take us further than before
We open up the door
Cause maybe there's an angel standing on the porch

Oh, maybe there's an angel at my door
Oh, maybe there's an angel at my door
Standing up high, taking this light, 
Oh, I'm gonna see the shining
Yeah maybe there's an angel at my door
Oh, maybe there's an angel at my door

We open up the door
Let the music take us further than before
We gotta open up the door
Cause maybe there's an angel standing on the porch

We gotta chase like we're behind
We gotta fall before we find
We gotta live like we were poor
We gotta show what hope is for
