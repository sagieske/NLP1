Song:

If you sat beneath the Christmas tree, you'd surely add to the colors
But even if you were gift wrapped, I couldn't love you more

This holiday... Hold me tight, you wonderful thing
And be my christmas gift that surely brightens up my day

You have to know that if I had you, I'd have the gift I'd most adore
Better than anything, better than any one else.
