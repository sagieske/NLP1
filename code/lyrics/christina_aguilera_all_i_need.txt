Song:

Kissing your lips, kissing you top to toe
Wishing for this, hoping for all you know
Hearing you breathe, you leave and return
Oh how we take, how we give, we learn
Taking my time, seeing the signs, letting you guide me home
Watching you grow, letting you know you are my only

[Chorus:]
You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms
And you're inside me

I tell you my fears, telling you everything
Telling the truth to you gives me wings
Free with my words, free as a bird
I am flying high

Looking at you, everything new, you are my life...

[Chorus:]
You bring me hope when I can't breathe
And you give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
So happy to carry you inside me

I'll feed you love and I hope it's enough to inspire you through suffering
Holding you up

[Chorus:]
You bring me hope when I can't breathe
You give me love, you're all I need
Slowly I'm holding you closely
You're wrapped in my arms
And you're inside meeee
