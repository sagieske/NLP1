Song:

Big leg women, keep your dresses down
You got stuff to make a bulldog hug a hound

If you roll your belly like you roll your dough
People, they's crying
They want some more
Roll your belly like you roll your dough
Hey, people, they's crying
People, they're crying for more

Big leg women sure got something good
People, they's crying about it in the neighborhood
Big leg women sure got something good
Now, if you don't believe me, ask everybody in my
Neighborhood
