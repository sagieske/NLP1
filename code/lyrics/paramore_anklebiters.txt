Song:

Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality.

Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else.

Fall in love with yourself.

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.

What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception.

And why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) your ignorance?
Oh, why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) the state you're in?

You should fall in love
With yourself, oh, again.
Fall in love with yourself.

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got.

Anklebiters! Anklebiters! 
Someday you're gonna be alone! 
Anklebiters! Anklebiters!
