Song:

Brave Jane, she's nobody's fool
She don't play silly games
She's hot when she's cool
She don't need anybody
To tell her what she should do
And when she'll need any kind of advice
She won't be calling on you
She ain't got nobody
But herself
And she ain't needing anybody else
But when you see her out on the street
She'll turn every head
She doesn't have to complete
Jane's got soul
(She's got soul)
Oh, yes she has
(She's got soul)
Brave Jane, she don't go telling no lies
Oh, she ain't gonna change for no one
She finds her strenght in her pride
She's got no pictures to frame
Of lovers left on the way
She makes no plans for tomorrow no more
She takes it day by day
Her heart is tender, if you only knew
This is brave Jane, brave Jane for you
She's got the kind of touch
That you'd like to feel
And when she loves you
You know it's for real
Jane's got sou
(She's got soul)
Oh, yes she has
(She's got soul)
(She's got soul
She's got soul)
And when she says it, she says it loud
She don't like walking on moving ground
There goes the passion we'll talk about
She comes and goes, she's got it all
Jane's got soul
(She's got soul)
Oh yes she has
(She's got soul)
And when she says it, she says it loud
She don't like walking on moving ground
There goes the passion we'll talk about
Jane's got soul
(She's got soul)
