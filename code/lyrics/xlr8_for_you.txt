Song:

I thought that I would never lose your love
That you'd never walk away
I thought that what we have was growing strong
Never thought you would be gone

And I was hoping you would stay
That you'll be here with me today
If you can only hear
If only you are near
I'm begging you to stay right here

And I will be forever waiting
And always wanting
Forever in a day (forever in a day)
And I will be true forever (true forever)
And ever after (and ever after)
Though you are far away (though you are far away)
This is how much it's true
I swear what I have in my heart's for you

Last night in my arms you were back with me
There was loving in the air (loving in the air)
As I was holding you so close to me
I was about to kiss you then

But then I woke up from this dream
And suddenly it's so extreme
I think it's so unfair
To feel and find you when
I'd lose you once again somewhere

And I will be forever waiting
And always wanting
Forever in a day (forever in a day)
And I will be true forever (I will be true)
And ever after
Though you are far away (though you are far away)
This is how much it's true
I swear what I have in my heart's for you (you)

And I will be forever waiting (forever waiting)
And always wanting (and always wanting)
Forever in a day (forever in a day oh ooh)
And I will be true forever (I will be true)
And ever after
Though you are far away (though you are far away)
This is how much it's true
I swear what I have in my heart's for you
