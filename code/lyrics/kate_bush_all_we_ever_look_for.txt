Song:

Just look at your father
And you'll see how you took after him.
Me, I'm just another
Like my brothers
Of my mother's genes.

All they really want for you
Are the things they didn't do.
All they ever wanted--a little clue.
All they ever wanted--the truth.
All they ever wanted--a little bit of you.
All they ever wanted,
But they never did get.

The whims that we're weeping for
Our parents would be beaten for
Leave the breast
And then the nest
And then regret you ever left.

All we're really looking for
Is another open door.
All we ever look for--another womb.
All we ever look for--our own tomb.
All we ever look for--ooh, la lune.
All we ever look for--a little bit of you, too.
All we ever look for,
But we never do score.

All we ever look for--a god.
All we ever look for--ooh, a drug.
All we ever look for--a great big hug.
All we ever look for--a little bit of you.
All we ever look for--a little bit of you, too.
All we ever look for,
But we never do score.
