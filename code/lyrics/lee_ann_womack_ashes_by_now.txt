Song:

This mornin is Monday
Where are you now?
Teasin my memory
Teaching me how
To lay low when I don't want to
Your love is elusive
This I know now
It's makin me crazy
Leavin me out in the open
When I don't want to

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're runnin all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

The moments of pleasure just
Never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone
And in a hurry

Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire, you're runnin all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

You're runnin all over town
As much as you burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

Just like a wildfire, you're runnin all over town
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ashes by now)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ashes by now)
As much as you've burned me baby, I should be ashes by now
