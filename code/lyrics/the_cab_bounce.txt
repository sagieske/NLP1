Song:

The lips that slip Are the lips that press
And the lips that leak seem to know you best

I put bodies into motion Keep this skin out in the open
Liars turn me on

Bed spread bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
And threw mine to the sky

Bounce Bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
Bounce bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
This is it, Call it quits with honesty (You don't need this)
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me

The lies that tied your tongue in knots
Are the words that grew to hit my spots
So filthy, Dialed desire
Swallowed pride but spit out fire
Liers turn me on

Bed spread bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
And threw mine to the sky

Bounce Bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
Bounce bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
This is it, Call it quits with honesty (You don't need this)
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me

Bounce bounce, baby (Bounce bounce, baby)
Bounce bounce, baby (Bounce bounce, baby)

So filthy, Dialed desire
Swallowed pride but spit out fire
Liers turn me on

Bounce Bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
Bounce bounce baby, Bounce back to me (You don't need this)
This is it, Call it quits with honesty (You don't need this)
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me
