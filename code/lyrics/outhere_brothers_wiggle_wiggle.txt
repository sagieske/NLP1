For all ya motherfuckers that didn't know

Don't stop movin' baby
Tutti frutti
Drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle (5x)

Energy! (8x)

Put yo a** on my face
I love the way your p***y tastes
Girl you know you are the one
Take that a** and make me come (2x)

Don't stop movin' baby
Tutti frutti
Drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle

Girl you've got to suck my d**k
And you've got to suck it quick (2x)

Energy! (8x)

Put yo a** on my face
I love the way your p***y tastes
Girl you know you are the one
Take that a** and make me come (2x)

Don't stop movin' baby
Tutti frutti
Drive me crazy
Wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle

Energy! (8x)
