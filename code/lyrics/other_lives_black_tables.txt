Song:

When the whites of your eyes come through,
You will see something new
With your body and mind restored,
It's good to see you back home

When the life in your eyes wants black,
Things return; you've come back
With your body and mind restored,
It's good to see you once more

Turning black tables
And you're turning black tables
And you're making your head whirl
Making your head whirl
And you're turning black tables
And you're turning black tables
And you're making your head whirl
Making your head whirl
