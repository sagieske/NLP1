Song:

I'm dying to catch my breath
Oh why don't I ever learn
I've lost all my trust that I'm sure we try to
Turn it around

Can you still see the heart of me
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace

Don't tear me down
For all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear me down
You've opened the door now
Don't let it close

Here on the edge again
I wish I could let it go
I know that I'm only one step away
From turning around

Can you still see the heart of me
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace

Don't tear me down
For all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear it down
What's left of me
Make my heart a better place

I've tried many times but nothing was real
Make it fade away
Don't break me down
I want to believe that this is for real
Save me from my fear
Don't tear me down

Don't tear me down
For all I need
Make my heart a better place

Don't tear me down
For all I need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't tear it down
What's left of me
Make my heart a better place
