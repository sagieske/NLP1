Song:

Spill out my heart
You don't hear a word
Cause your busy thinkin how long till it's your turn
So you can go on and on about yourself
So you can go on and on about yourself
And my heart can go back on the shelf
So you can go on about yourself!

But it's not all about you
All about you
The more you speak the less I care about you
It's not all about you
The world turns without you
The more you speak the less I care about you you you you

Whatever I do, you've already done
Only youve done it better and way before anyone
Cause you think it's a game to win
You think it's a game to win
Acommplishments and places been
You think it's a game to win

But it's not all about you
All about you
The more you speak the less I care about you
It's not all about you
The world turns without you
The more you speak the less I care about you you you you
Care about you you you

You go on and on and on about yourself
You go on and on and on about yourself
The people you know
The places that you've been
Why can't you see that no one cares about you
It's not all about you
The more you speak the less I care about you
It's not all about you
The world turns without you
The more you speak the less I care about you you you you
Care about you!
