Song:

Sleeping beauty
Thing of the past
Dreams like this weren't made to last
Open my eyes to find a hand is shaking me

Horror story
Thing of the past
Nightmares were not made to last
Closing my eyes to find a true awakening

Brief candle; burn away
I will die another day
Goblins in my passageway
Cannot keep this life at bay

War story
Thing of the past
Soldiers were not made to last
Ears full of gunfire and eyes full of blood
A casualty

Love story
Thing of the past
Innocence was not made to last
All that remains of him is a child inside of me

Brief candle; burn away
I will die another day
Goblins in my passageway
Cannot keep this life at bay
