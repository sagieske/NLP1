Song:

If she's got her eye on you - there's no escape

She keeps her motives strictly - under her cape

She shows no mercy no - she plays it rough

She don't want your money - she wants your love.

Better cali the cops - better call the cops

Better call the police.
Better come quick - better come quick

While I'm in one piece.
Better bring a book - better bring a book
Better bring charges

For attempted breaking and entering my heart.
She's a love stealer yeah

Raw dealer yeah

Heartbreaker - lovetaker - yeah yeah.
She'll just hang around at first - casing the joint

Then she'll move in and get right to the
So keep your love locked away - don't let it show

Or the love thief will rob you of more than you know.

Better call the cops - better call the cops
