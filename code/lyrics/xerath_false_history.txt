Song:

False, true to life
Belief system
What is left, cannot be salvaged
This dying faith in a dead god
What is left, a false history

[Chorus:]
The way the world has turned
To denial
This unforgiving change
Paralleled and forced on us
Denial

An ancient whisper
Sending chills through the ages
An idea like poison
An endless pain that yearns to forget
Reminder of our fragility
Ever persuaded and pushed into corners
Always looking for the reasons to settle
And land on assumption

We stand, divided and still
Not moving with the pattern of the fools
Content with sensory assurances
Not looking forward to uncertainty
