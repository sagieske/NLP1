Song:

The arctic views
Its distant vast
And the shifting breeze
That blows my horizon
Where stormclouds mass
Along the skies
Dark and brooding
Across the blistered
Broken land

Here flew long streams
Of freezing water
In a saga it lived once
Descended to the brinks
That tower to the sky
Sound my cry
Throughout creation
Still I'm
Enlocked
On these ridges
Where the sun
Forever vanished
Once a world were
Ever splendid
That took my soul

Now the world
Is too old
So take me biting winds
My soul travels
With a black heart

When the darkness
Closes in on me
There's this world where I can
Breathe
Still the saga will live on
And the breeze that blew my
Horizon
Behind these waves of ice
