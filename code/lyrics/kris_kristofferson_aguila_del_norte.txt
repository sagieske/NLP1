Song:

Did anybody see them?
I heard there was a baby
Somebody heard her crying
Weaker through the night

They beat her mama bloody
And shot her with her daddy
It was the terror from above
El Aguila Del Norte

Down in Nicaragua
Running from the shadows
Striking holy terror
Deeper in the heart

You believe in Freedom
And you believe in justice
But not in Nicaragua
Not in Nicaragua

Aguila Del Norte
We can see your power
And the beauty of your freedom
What is in your heart?

You believe in honor
And you believe in Jesus
But not in Nicaragua
Not in Nicaragua
