Song:

Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, all (all night)
Yeah, until the break of day (all night)
Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, (all night)
Yeah, until the music fades

Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
Come'on celebrate
Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
So dj play my song.
(Yeah)

Pretty young thing got me hypnotized
I'm sprung off the crib tonight {or kryptonite?}
Babygirl lemme spend the night
Just can't get you out my mind
The way you shine, you're a superstar
Hottest one on the boulevard
What you drinkin? Cos I'm at the bar
Don't be shy you can have it all
Movin at the speed of light
Dance cos the feelin's right
You and me tonight
Oh what a feelin, this can't be life.

Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, all (all night)
Yeah, until the break of day (all night)
Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, (all night)
Yeah, until the music fades

Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
Come'on celebrate (yeah)
Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
So dj play my song.
(Yeah)

Oh yeah, party with your hands in the air
Like dang, lemme see you pop champagne
Like yeah, baby look good all night
And damn, we can get lost when the music plays
Hey mama, say mama, star
Girl you look good with the club lights on
Freaks on the dance floor getting it on
And, all I wanna do is sing along
Like Yeah, all my ladies wanna stay right here
Bounce in the club like it's a new year
You get to drink up like a million men
And it would be okay (we don't care)

Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, all (all night)
Yeah, until the break of day (all night)
Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, (all night)
Yeah, until the music fades

Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
Come'on celebrate (yeah)
Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
So dj play my song.

Go D, this is how it goes with an mvp
Playa for life, I'm from the 213
Pop your heart [?], then have your drinks on me
Lets get it poppin, betta get like me
Dance floor poppin, lean and a rockin
Check my options, damn you sparkle
But still look flawless, everybody pause
And there's so many girls but it's you {... This line I'm not sure about}
Sh-sh-sh-sh-she's picture perfect, so incredible,
This girl, she's my sweet escape
One look at her, and you already know
She's come to my secret hideaway

Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, all (all night)
Yeah, until the break of day (all night)
Where we can do it all, (night)
All night long, (all night)
Yeah, until the music fades

Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
Come'on celebrate
Don't ya wanna, Come party,
Fiesta, forever
So dj play... My... Song.
(Yeah)
