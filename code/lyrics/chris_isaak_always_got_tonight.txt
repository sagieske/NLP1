Song:

Here's to good times, baby now it's up to you
Tell me darlin what it is you wanna do
If you want me, you know I could be with you
We always got tonight, always got tonight

You say you're happy that you found somebody new
Now you're leaving, gone for a day or two
Think it over, I can make it up to you
We always got tonight

Ain't no stars up in the sky, I wonder why I feel so blue
Over you
It doesn't matter what you say, I feel this way
Feel like it's true, when I look at you

Take it easy, tell him that you'll telephone
If he calls back, just pretend you're all alone
If you love me, then it is really wrong
We always got tonight, always got tonight

There ain't a cloud up in the sky
I don't know why I feel so blue
Without you
You tell me now you want me too
It doesn't matter what you do
I'm here for you
Ain't no stars up in the sky, now you're gone
Doesn't matter what you do on your own
You told me once that you were mine, you were wrong
I'm alone

Skip the bad times, tell me how it's gonna be
What we do now, really isn't up to me
Let me come by, this much I can guarantee
We always got tonight, always got tonight
Ain't no stars up in the sky, I wonder why I get so blue
Over you
Doesn't matter what you say, I feel this way
Feel like it's true, when I look at you
Doesn't matter what you say, now you're gone
Doesn't matter what you do on your own
I told you once that you were mine, I was wrong
Now you're gone
Always got tonight, we always got tonight baby
Oooooh, yeah
