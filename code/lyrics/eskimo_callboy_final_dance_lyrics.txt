Song:

We hope your're f*****g ready to party like a star
Just take off all your clothes and get your shots from that bar
Tonight you're gonna die but it's f*****g worth it
So take your last sip, baby. This will be your final dance

Chorus:
And everything is running out of control
[We got the] pockets full of money and a heart made of gold
[You gotta] keep your head up high and start to move your body body and shake your a**. Come on!

No matter where you came from but we know where you'll end
No matter where you came from you're gonna end right now
You're gonna end right now.
And we just wanna say "You're gonna end right now"

These shining lights are not a disco ball
We wanna dance tonight, so give a f**k 'bout heaven's call
We want s**, we want drugs, wanna show off our horns
We are your saviors cause we are the sinborns

Chorus:
And everything is running out of control
[We got the] pockets full of money and a heart made of gold
[You gotta] keep your head up high and start to move your body body and shake your a**. Come on!

This is gonna be your final dance, the last call
You can hide but we know where you're f*****g at
Raise your head and cry for salvation
Cause tonight we dance into doom
This is not your f*****g prom night
This will be your final dance
This is not your f*****g prom night
This will be your final dance

Chorus:
And everything is running out of control
[We got the] pockets full of money and a heart made of gold
[You gotta] keep your head up high and start to move your body body and shake your a**. Come on!

And everything is running out of control
We got a whole lot of whisky and some girls at a pole
You gotta keep your head up high and start to party till you black out, dance to your end

Chorus (x2):
And everything is running out of control
[We got the] pockets full of money and a heart made of gold
[You gotta] keep your head up high and start to move your body body and shake your a**. Come on!

You're gonna end right now
And we just wanna say
"You're gonna end right now"
