Song:

[Verse 1 - Rae Morris:]
I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there was one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down

[Pre-Chorus:]
Even though I'm not over it yet
I can put forever in the plans that you have
Stupid and low with the odds that you bet
I can put forever in the plans that you have

[Chorus:]
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again

[Verse 2:]
I wanna take it back, everything we had
The curse of love has had me and it turned my heart bad
With a will there's a way, 'definite' you say
I'm looking out to the water, I'm singing my heart out

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
Even though I'm not really over it yet
I can see forever in the plans that you had
Stupid low with odds that had you bet
I can see forever in the plans that you had

[Verse 1 - Rae Morris:]
I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there was one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down

[Chorus:]
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again

[Verse 3:]
It's take to take it back, everything we had
The curse of love is healthy if it gives your heart back
With a will there's a way, 'to definite' you say
I'm running out to the water, I'm singing my heart out

[Verse 1 - Rae Morris:]
I've given up again, maybe I'm just tired
Of thinking that there was one way, only one way out
I was hoping by now, that maybe I'd have found
Answers to the questions that are keeping me down

[Chorus:]
Take my life and start it somewhere else
I breathe in the change
The only way is up again
Everybody knows that I
Won't make the same mistakes
The only way is up again
[Outro:]
(I'm singing my heart out)
The only way is up again
(I'm singing my heart out)
