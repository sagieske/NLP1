Song:

I couldn't seem to fall asleep
There was so much on my mind
Searching for that peace
But the peace I could not find
So then I knealed down to pray
Praying help me please
Then He said you don't have to cry
Cause I'll supply all your needs

As sooon as I stop worrying (soon as I stopped worrying)
Worrying how the story ends (When I let go)
I let go (And I let) and I let God (let Him have)
(Let Him Have) Let God have His way
(That's when things) That's when things start happening
I'll stop looking at back then
I let go and I'll let God have His way

There so much going on
Sometimes I can't find my way
And often times I struggle
Struggle from day to day
I have to realize that it's not my battle
It's not my battle to fight
I have to know if I put it in His hands
That everything will be alright

(Back to Chorus)

Let go
Let God x5
My brother let go
And let God
My sister you can't handle it
Let God
Oh let go
And let God [x3]
Let go
Let God [x6]
