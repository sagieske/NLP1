[Troy]: Whoo!
[Ryan]: Come On!
[Sharpay]: Alright!
[Chad]: Little Louder Now!
[Gabriella]: Hey!

[Troy & Gabriella:]
Lookin' Forward From Center Stage,
To Graduation Day, Time To Get The Future Started!
What We Leave, What We Take With Us,
No Matter What, It's Somethin' We're Part Of!
We Learn To Fly.
Together Side-By-Side.
I Just Want The Rest Of My Life, To Feel As Good As My,

[Everyone:]
High School Musical,
Who Says We Have To Let It Go?
It's The Best Part We've Ever Known, Step Into The Future!
But Hold On to,
High School Musical, Lets Celebrate Where We Come From,
The Friends Who've been There All Along, Just Like,
Our High School, High School Musical!

[Ryan & Sharpay:]
Improvisation Without A Script,
No Ones Written It, And Now We Have The Chance Too!
Someday We'll Be Lookin' Back,
Memories We've Had, All The Songs That We Lived Through!
The Best Of Times,
So Why Leave Them Behind. Why can't The Rest Of My Life
Be Like My,

[Everyone:]
High School Musical,
Who Says We Have To Let It Go?
It's The Best Part We've Ever Known, Step Into The Future!
We'll Hold On to,
High School Musical, Lets Celebrate Where We Come From,
The Friends Who've been There All Along, That's Right, (That's Right)

[Chad & Taylor:]
Now We Finally Realize
Who We Are, It Just Took Some Time
We Had To Live And To Live To See The Truth
[Everyone:]
Learn To See The Truth!
(Chad & Taylor):
But Nothing's Ever Impossible,
Into The Future We All Free-Fall.
But Forever We'll Always Have High School!

[Troy:]
Turn the Party, Lets Celebrate!
[Troy & Gabriella:]
Cause The Worlds One Big Stage,
And In It What You Want, It Can Be Yours!

[Everyone:]
Everybody Sing, Yeah!
[Troy:]
Can You Show Us, Now We're Wanna Go?
[Gabriella:]
It's Where The Status Is Here, Oh.
[Everyone:]
High School, Lives On Forever More!
