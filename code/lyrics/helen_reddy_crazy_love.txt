Song:

I can hear his heart beat
For a thousand miles
And the heavens open
Every time he smiles

And when I come to him
That's where I belong
Yet I'm running to him
Like a river's song

[Chorus:]
He give me love, love
Love, love, crazy love
He give me love, love
Love, love, crazy love

He's got a fine sense of humor
When I'm feeling low down
And when I come to him
When the sun goes down

Take away my trouble
Take away my grief
Take away my heartache
In the night like a thief

[Chorus:]

Yes, I need him in the daytime
Yes, I need him in the night
Yes, I want to throw my arms around him
Kiss him, hug him, kiss him, hug him tight

And when I'm returning
From so far away
He gives me some sweet loving
Brighten up my day

Yes, it makes me righteous
Yes, it makes me feel whole
Yes, it makes me mellow
Down in to my soul

[Chorus:]
