Song:

You gave me hope you made me whole at the cross.
You took my place you showed me grace.
At the cross where you died for me.

Chorus

And his glory appears like the light from the sun
Age to age he shines look to the skies hear the angels cry.
Saying holy is the Lord.

Chorus

You gave me hope you made me whole at the cross.
You took my place you showed me grace
At the cross where you died for me.

And his glory appears like the light from the sun.
Age to age he shines look to the skies here the angels cry.
Saying holy is the Lord.
