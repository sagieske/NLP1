Song:

When I call you in the morning
And tell you everything's allright
I can't see into the future
Don't see the danger in the night

When I hear the sirene wailing
I see the flashin' of light
I know that there is trouble
And there are battles yet to fight
'Cause I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

And there's an inner peace I'm seeking
There's a lightness in my soul
And everythime I think I found it,
I wanna touch it, feel it hold
And the day that I stop asking
Will be the day I say goodbye
The world may not be safer
But there's no truth without the lie
'Cause I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

No, I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

I've asked the good Lord Jesus
I'm asking Allah too
I've tried the great god Buddah
And now I'm asking you
I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

When you're deep in troubled waters
You've got to fight for every breath
You feel you're getting weaker
You're facing life, you're facing death

But if you have a God to turn to
Don't turn the other way
Or a friend that you can call on
Just a prayer that you can say
I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way

No, I may not have all the answers, no
I wouldn't have it any other way
