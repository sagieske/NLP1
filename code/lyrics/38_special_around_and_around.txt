Song:

They say the joint was rockin'
A goin' 'round and round
Yeah reelin' and a rockin'
What a crazy sound
But you never stopped rockin'
Till the moon went down

Though it sounds so sweet
I hadda take me a chance
I rose out of my seat
I just had to dance
Started movin' my feet
Yeah clappin' my hands, Alright

But you kept on rockin'
Going 'Round and around
Yeah reelin' and a rockin'
What a crazy sound
But you never stopped rockin'
Till the moon went down

I said Twelve o'clock
I say the place as packed
The front doors was locked
I say the place was packed
When the police knocked
Both doors flew back

Chorus twice
