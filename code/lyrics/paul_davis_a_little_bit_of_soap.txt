Song:

Mmm, just a little bit

A little bit of soap will wash
Away your lipstick from my face
A little bit of soap will never
Never, ever, ever erase

The pain in my heart and my eyes
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears

Mmm, just a little bit of soap will
Take way your powder from my chin
A little bit of soap will never
Never, ever, ever begin

To take away the hurt that I feel
As I go through the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears

Now have you heard
When love begins to die
It leaves someone to cry
Night and day

Just like a bird
You left the robin's nest
You're just like all the rest
You flew away, yeah

A little bit of soap will
Take away your perfume eventually
A little bit of soap will never
Take away the memory

Of your name in the night
As I call go the lonely years
A little bit of soap will never
Wash away my tears

Mmm, just a little bit of soap
(Just a little, just a little)...
