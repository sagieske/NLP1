Song:

You're a love song
Only half-way sung
You're the knot that comes undone
Dressed as darkest night
The flight of a stringless kite

The very vision
The mirage man
You're air in the palm of my hand
You're like catching
The day's sunset
O rain that's never wet

You're a butterfly in the mind
You're a butterfly before my eyes
You're a butterfly, a trick of time

Who leaves before he arrives

You're a butterfly in the mind
You're a butterfly before my eyes
You're a butterfly, who says he's mine

Who leaves before he arrives
