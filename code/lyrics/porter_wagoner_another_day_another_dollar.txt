Song:

Another day another dollar
Daylight comes I'm on my way
Another day another dollar
Workin' my whole life away.

The boss told me I'd get paid weakly
And that's exactly how I'm paid
Another day another dollar
Workin' my whole life away.

Another day another dollar
Daylight comes I'm on my way
Another day another dollar
Workin' my whole life away.

My family is my thanksgiving
I love 'em more and more each day
And they're the reason I keep living
And working my whole life away.

Another day another dollar
Daylight comes I'm on my way
Another day another dollar
Workin' my whole life away.
