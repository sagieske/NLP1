Song:

We sit atop of a broken world,
We are not holy, we are graveyard souls!

In the midst of all the chaos we are so quick to place the blame
(So quick to place the blame)
On what we don't understand,
Our brothers and sisters that don't share our name!

The echoes of this desperate world (of this desperate world),
Fill up my lungs like I'm reborn (I'm reborn).
Let's find strength in the unfamiliar,
And hold that truth close to our heart.
Shut your eyes and let life restart (let life restart).

Love is an abandoned thought.
What is the point of this if hate's what we rely on?
What is the point? I don't see truth in their lies.
I see the blood she'd a mask-less disguise,
And countless of lives.
Destroyed by a world created by men.
When will it end? When will it end?!

Only you and I
Have a chance to make our wrongs in to rights.
And heaven knows I've plenty I've done wrong,
But only I can choose what I become.

When the lightning strikes,
And we blindly must whether the world through the door.
Just shut your eyes,
And remember you're never alone.

Hope is what we hold on to,
When fear is all that we know.
If darkness and heaven are both in existence,
I promise there's somewhere to go.

I can't see what's wrong with living for myself.
Question your thoughts,
And free yourself from what you think that you're not.
There's always somewhere else to go,
There's always somewhere else to go!
