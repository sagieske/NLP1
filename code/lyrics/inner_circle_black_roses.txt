Song:

Black roses
By Inner Circle
Chorus:
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
Oh nurturing years of so long
Whatever happened to my
Garden of black roses
They say a stranger treated them wrong
When I was a boy
I planted a garden yeah
That meant so much to me
One of reality
A garden of love none like this
Before me
One of a kind equality
A prayer for you and me
Wo ho ho ho ho
Chorus
If we can keep
The candles burning
To shelter them from pain
And let them live again
Shower the world with their innocence
Who's tears felt like rain, history remains the same
Wo ho ho ho ho
Bridge:
But one by one they come up missing
Strangers thought that I was sleeping
Some life somelife means nothing to some
Watch out now we've got them on the run
Repeat chorus and fade
