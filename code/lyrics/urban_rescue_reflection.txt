Song:

I wanna burn bright like a star in the night
Fall, fall, and surrender it all
Sing awhile
And believe like a child
I just want to be your reflection.

I wanna burn bright like a star in the night
Fall, fall, and surrender it all
Sing awhile
And believe like a child
I just want to be your reflection.

Because when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

Because when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

I wanna burn bright like a star in the night
Fall, fall, and surrender it all
Sing awhile
And believe like a child
I just want to be your reflection.

I wanna burn bright like a star in the night
Fall, fall, and surrender it all
Sing awhile
And believe like a child
I just want to be your reflection.

Because when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

Oh, when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

Oh great light of the world
Shine on
Shine on me
Oh great light of the world
Shine on me

Oh great light of the world
Shine on
Shine on me
Oh great light of the world
Shine on me

'Cause when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

'Cause when you shine
I come alive
I'm on fire for you
I'm on fire for you.

I wanna burn bright like a star in the night
Fall, fall, and surrender it all
Sing awhile
And believe like a child
I just want to be your reflection.
