Song:

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
Whatever comes our way

Yeah baby gonna make ya happen
Take the world into a love embrace
Fire all your guns and explode into space

Life is full of lightning
Heavy metal thunder
Racing with the wind
The feeling that I'm under

Yeah baby gonna make ya happen
Take the world into a love embrace
Fire all your guns and explode into space

Like a true nature child
We was born to be wild
We climb so high
We never gonna die

Born to be wild
Born to be wild, awww

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
Whatever comes our way

Yeah baby gonna make ya happen
Take the world into a love embrace
Fire all your guns at once and explode into space

Like a true nature child
We was born to be wild
We gonna climb so high
We never gonna die, yeah

Born to be wild
We where born to be wild
Ahhhhhhhhh, yeah
