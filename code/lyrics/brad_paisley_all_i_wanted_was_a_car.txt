Song:

My buddy Blake was all-state with dreams of the nfl
Jenny Mcclain had big brains
She got a scholarship to Yale
And there was Hershel who did two commercials
And he was going to be a movie star
But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car

Had a part time job making chicken kababs at the food court at the mall
I hauled my uncle's trash
I cut my neighbor's grass
And I raked the leaves in the fall
My parents they were stunned how this former lazy bum was suddenly working so hard

But all I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car

Yeah when I was sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing

All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car

When I finally got that big hunk of steel
Those four wheels underneath
I went everywhere in it
Broke the speed limit
And I even broke in the backseat

Now when I look outside sitting in the drive
It blows my mind to see an suv and a sedan
And two kids playing and I can't believe they all belong to me

When I caught my mama's eye in that thing I used to drive
I never dreamed it would take me this far

All I wanted was a car
Sixteen all of my dreams revolved around one thing
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
All I wanted was a car
