Song:

I got a secret, I don’t like your face,
You wear too much make-up, it’s all over the place.
So long, look after death,
Ain’t no hide and even wide.

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said I was trouble.
So low, no confidence
Ain’t no hide and even wide.

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said I was trouble.

What you gonna do?
Are you gonna cry now?
So are you gonna break down?
What you gonna do?
Are you gonna go down?
So are you gonna cry now? Cry now!

So what, I’ve seen you before,
Watched you at the showroom at the liquor store.
Maybe you don’t understand
That I don’t wanna hear your band,
No, don’t care at all.

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said I was trouble.
So low, no confidence
Ain’t no hide and even wide.

Nobody said it was easy
Nobody said I was trouble.

What you gonna do?
Are you gonna cry now?
So are you gonna break down?
What you gonna do?
Are you gonna go down?
So are you gonna cry now? Cry now!

What you gonna do?
Are you gonna cry now?
So are you gonna break down?
So are you gonna cry now?
So are you gonna cry now? Cry now!
Are you gonna cry?
Are you gonna cry now?
