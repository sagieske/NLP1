Song:

In my youth
Had someone told me
What would come
And how things would be
Then those days would've been a much brighter place
But the doubt of not knowing
Leaves a stigma that is hard to shake

To celebrate our bond
[I'm gonna build a monument]
I'll cut the stone today
[On the side of a mountain]
Where all my doubts once lay
[The biggest mountain]
One thing I can gaurantee
Is what you've done means everything to me

Waking Monday
Reading Saturday's news
In a town
I've not seen before
Curious
Small and ugly room
I can't find the door and everywhere
There's faces smiling at me

To celebrate our bond
[I'm gonna build a monument]
I'll cut the stone today
[On the side of a mountain]
Where all my doubts once lay
[The biggest mountain]
One thing I can gaurantee
Is what you've done means everything to me

In my youth
Had someone told me
What would come
And how things would be
Then those days would've been a much brighter place
And the doubts of not knowing
Leaves a stigma that is hard to shake

To celebrate our bond
[I'm gonna build a monument]
I'll cut the stone today
[On the side of a mountain]
Where all my doubts once lay
[The biggest mountain]
One thing I can gaurantee
Is what you've done means everything to me

To celebrate our bond
[I'm gonna build a monument]
I'll cut the stone today
[On the side of a mountain]
Where all my doubts once lay
[The biggest mountain]
One thing I can gaurantee
Is what you've done means everything to me

To celebrate our bond
[I'm gonna build a monument]
I'll cut the stone today
[On the side of a mountain]
Where all my doubts once lay
[The biggest mountain]
One thing I can gaurantee
Is what you've done means everything to me

Everything to me
Everything to me
