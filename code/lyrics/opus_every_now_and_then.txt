Song:

EVERY NOW AND THEN
- IVE GOT TO THINK AGAIN
OF TIMES WHEN LIFE
WAS EASY LIKE A GAME
EVERA NOW AND THEN
- WITH NOTHING MUCH
LEFT TO RETAIN
I KNOW THAT IT WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME
- NEVERMORE THE SAME
SINCE IT BURNED,
BURNED DOWN AND NEVER STOPPED
BACK THEN IN APRIL 19866
STILL IT BURNS,
HOW WILL IT EVER STOP
IF ALL OUR HOUSE
IS BUILT OF NUCLEAR BRICKS
EVERY NOW AND THEN
- I FEEL IT AGAIN
MY EYES LOOK DOWN
SO PARALIZED WITH SHAME
EVERY NOW AND THEN
- SOME TEARS OF FEAR
I can't RESTAIN
COULD WE HAVE ALREADY LOST THE GAME?
CAUSE IT BURNED, BURNED DOWN
AND NEVER STOPPED
BACK THEN IN APRIL 1986
STILL IT BURNS,
HOW WILL WE EVER STOP
OUR BOAT that's DRIFTIN
DOWNSTREAM ON THE STYX
AND IT BURNED
BURNED DOWN AND NEVER STOPPED
BACK THEN IN APRIL 1986
STILL IT BURNS
HOW WILL IT EVER STOP
IF WE IGNORE
THE BOMBS INCREASIN TICK
