Song:

The battle was over at Caster's last stand
And taps were sounding for all the brave men
While one lone survivor wounded and weak
Comanche the Brave Horse laied at the General's feet
Comanche you fought hard Comanche you tried
You were a good soldier so hold your head up high
For even the greatest sometimes must fall Comanche the Brave Horse you gave your all
Though you are silent your deeds did speak loud
If your buddies could see you I know they'd be proud
The symbol of bravery at the Little Big Horn
Poor old Comanche your battle scarred and worn
Comanche you fought hard...
Comanche you fought hard...
