Song:

[Intro: Yo Gotti]
I'm going going back back to the Bay
Rest in peace Mac Dre
All I do is talk yay

[Bridge: Yo Gotti]
In the club got them bottles on replay
Tryna break a record like a dj
That's a hundred fifty bottles in one night
I give that b***h some act right

[Hook: Yo Gotti]
Act right, act right
Money don't fold if it act right
Act right, act right
N-ggas playin' games you can act right

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I'm goin' goin back back to the Bay
Rest in peace Mac Dre
I'm a street n-gga all I do is talk yay
Want me in your city n-gga know they gon' pay
Ain't lookin' for a free throw, lookin for a freak ho
Cuban link chain on my neck weigh a kilo
N-gga just violated pissed dirty to his P. O.
On the real n-gga scale one to ten you a zero
Damn, that a bad b***h you a Creole
On the West coast but she say she from the N. O.
Act right, get your life changed
F-ck a purse you can get the last name
Real n-gga s**t boy I hate lames
All my n-gga sell dope or gang bang
Me and cash get the act right
You ain't in a foreign you don't look right

[Bridge:]

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I'mma tell ya off top mother f-ck free Boosie
Ridin' in my Lamborghini with the dope man uzi
Thinkin' came with a step might be the s**t
I got a rooster in my Rari might be your b***h
I said I pull to detention Aventador
Make you b***h pass out straight hit the floor
Said I never seen a car like that before
What's that thang stickin up? That's the door
I told yg I'mma go ride the whip
You just hangin' out the window ghost ride the clip
I made my first quarter million dollars off the blow
He want a nine piece chicken took that to-go
I'mma tell ya like this, ya'll motherf-cker listen
Kilo all day motherf-cker I'm trippin'
But if you run up on me think I'm slippin'
Michael Jordan with the chopper man I hit you like Pippen act right

[Bridge:]

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: yg]
Goin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to myself
I'mma fly n-gga n-gga I take your ho
I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco
The devil talkin' to me, but I don't hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
F-ck you, f-ck him, f-ck them
F-ck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
N-ggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt
I'm in the Fendi store I don't need help
All gold everything like Trinidad
I went to high school with you b***h you been a rat
I don't got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stay is with the two pistols

[Bridge:]
