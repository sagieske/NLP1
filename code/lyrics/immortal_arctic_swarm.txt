Song:

Through the storm of storm the Aurora lights
In her swirling skies a wrathlike ice
Born to ride the cold, winds of the North
Cometh to freeze the grounds

Release the arctic swarm to drag us down
Spread it's shivering wings, caught us by it's cold
With haunting frosty eyes, it journeys fast
The cold will bring the fall

The arctic swarm
Indestructible cold

The arctic swarm a fiend, of frost and ice
Gathering winds that howl in frost lines
Transatlantic travels a moss of cold
Revenge on mankind

Deep cold green seas... Shivering masses
Winds tide heavy waves
Of continental darkness

Into the ice you see... It devours all
Unbreakable it's ice walls are
Aghastic majestic sight

Chaotic apocalypse
A floating storm
On colossal powers
All souls to the frozen world

Into the ice you see... It devours all
Unbreakable it's ice walls are
Eyes filled with ice

The arctic swarm
Indestructible cold
