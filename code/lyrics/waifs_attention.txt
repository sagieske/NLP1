Song:

I was thinking about something else I must admit
I didn't hear a word that you said
Remember to remind me not to forget
To pay more attention now, attention now

When you talk to me you can expect it
To go into one ear and out of the next
Ask me a question about something you said
All I remember's what's stuck in my head

You say that I shouldn't be so
Vague, inattentive, a law to myself
I guess that I live in a world of my own
And all that I know now is all that I've known

Sometimes life is like Russian roulette
It's a wonder that I'm still around
Twenty-four years I'm the first to admit
I don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' 'bout it

All of our lives we're alone
Though we may have someone to call our own
I could be right but I'm probably wrong
I don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' 'bout it
I don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' 'bout it
I don't know nothin' 'bout nothin' 'bout it
