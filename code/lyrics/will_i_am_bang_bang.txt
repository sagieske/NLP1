[Verse:]
I love her, can’t leave her,
Forever I’ll always need her,
She lie, but I believe her,
Lovesick I got that fever.
Love stupid, I know it,
Love stupid, I know it,
I know, cause I’m a fool in love.

My baby shot me down again,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang.
That girl’s a killer from a gang,
Shot me down with the love and it go bang bang.

And oh, I love her so, that’s why I gotta let her know
That I’ll be here for her to always love her down.

And maybe that’s the truth,
The clock can tick and ain’t no use,
I wonder when my tux can see you when you’re down.

[Chorus:]
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

[Verse:]
I love her, can’t leave her,
Forever I’ll always need her,
She lie, but I believe her,
Lovesick I got that fever.
Love stupid, I know it,
Love stupid, I know it,
I know, cause I’m a fool in love.

My baby shot me down, down, down, down
Shot me down with the love and it went pow-pow
I love my baby’s freaky style,
But my baby’s always sneaking out.

But damn, I love her so,
That’s why I gotta let her know
That I’ll be here for her, I’ll always be her man.
And baby, that’s the truth,
You’re my chick, bottlecruise,
I got that roof, I put that diamond on her hand.

[Chorus:]
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Love him down, down
I shot my baby with a bang, bang,
Got him with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

[Bridge:]
Oh, yeah, I love my baby
Hey baby yeah I love you,
Stupid is what stupid do,
Tom and Jerry and Scooby Do,
Oh baby, I’m a fool for you.
Come here, baby, be my lollypop,
I make it better, make the booty drop.
Hey baby, can’t get you out my brains,
Damn girl, you’re such a s*** thing.
Pretty little lady
And my baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down
My baby makes me go down down…
