Song:

From the phantom of the opera raoul
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
Im here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.
Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
Im here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Christine
Say you'll love me evry waking moment;
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Raoul
Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
Youre safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

Christine
All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Raoul
Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from you solitude.
Say you want me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
That's all I ask of you.

Christine
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime.

Together
Say the word and I will follow you.
Share each day with me, each night, each morning.

Christine
Say you love me...

Raoul
You know I do.

Together
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
Love me...
That's all I ask of you.
