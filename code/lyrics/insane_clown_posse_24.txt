(Violent J) ALL NIGHT, find me robbin your jewels, settin fires, damaging and breakin into schools IN THE DARKNESS, it's much easier to be heartless, breakin the window out the Lincoln, and screwdriver start this muggin people droppin on 'em from street lights, stab 'em with garden tools, or beat 'em with pipes so dont come out, stay inside cozy and tucked and if im breakin in, ya old lady's gettin... Fucked

(Saggy) ALL DAY, car jacks get out the van, as soon a they step out, i pop 'em anyway "BLAMMM!" i rob liquor stores with a lil' 22 hold, i know its nothing but it's something when its bustin' at your nose SUNNY DAYS, i hit up the brach with cleats on, and stomp bitches in they ass tryna tan in they thongs ALL DAT, see me fuckin' hookers at truck stops, and then i kill 'em 'cause that's where my buck stops

(Violent J) ALL NIGHT, im wicked and i got the power, bloodsheds on the wall during the witching hour IN THE DARKNESS, see me ride by in an Impala draggin' some fuck ass by his foot and hear him hala IN THE NIGHT TIME, i take what's rightfully mine, i run through emergency rooms and sever life lines fuck the lime light, i'm the one i need to impress, with a dubble dip, swinging ax chop to your chest!

(Shaggy) ALL DAY, i'm sellin' coke laced joints to little kids, im a clown in a milk truck handlin' biz IN THE SUNSHINE, i been known to take shots at the po, i'm in the bushes with the camouflage on and rifle scope ALL DAY, i'm wicked, i keep it horrorfying, ax murderer some kid and his dad kite flying i knock the fuckin' mail man out on the grass and burned holes in his face with the magnifying glass

(Violent J) ALL NIGHT, i fly like a vamipire bat, and murder people telling stoyies where there the camp fires at BLAME IT ON THE MOONLIGHT OR BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE, i shot the motherfuckin' sheriff and his deputy rookie WHEN IT'S DARK OUT, i hit the streets in the shadows and grab yos, and BOOGIE THE WOOGIE and stab hoes dont even give me a pound when you see this clown, you gettin' cut the fuck up and chopped the fuck down!

(Shaggy) ALL DAY, catch me picnicing with bitches in the park, right before i icepick 'em in the heart 24/7, if it aint us it's somebody gettin' bloody, wicked clowns aint the only ones nutty buddy CATCH ME, TOUNGE KISSIN' a severed head, catch me burying another bitch dead behind a shed it doesnt matter, night or day, all around the clock, Violent J and Shaggy Chop, Chop, Chop, Chop! YA GONNA DIE
