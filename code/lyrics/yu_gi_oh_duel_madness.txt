(Virtual systems ready)
Got to find a way just to play just a little game
Got a compulsion, want to be a champion
Got to feel the heart, got to be smart play the card
Got to get inside the mind of my counterpart
Yeah!
That's the key, I'm a split personality
Duel Sensation, that's my destiny
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Monster influence, in my veins
Got find a way inside this fantasy
Holographic Duelling Monster reality
Got to find a way, got to see my strategies
Yu-Gi-Oh! I'm a dual duality
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Summon the Dragon. Blue-Eyes White
Send in the Swords of Revealing Light
Will Yugi control the power
Or will the power control Yugi?
Got a card face down, make a face-up crowd
Face up, showdown, say the words out loud
Duel Madness!
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Monster influence, in my veins
Got to think be wise, realise the situation
Animate your cards, make a power combination
Sick-a-pow, Sick-a-Pow
Sick-a-sick-a-pow, Pow
Wanna do, wanna do
What I wanna wanna do?
Sick-a-pow, Sick-a-Pow
Sick-a-sick-a-pow, Pow
Wanna do, wanna do
What I wanna wanna do?
Sick-a-pow, Sick-a-Pow
Sick-a-sick-a-pow, Pow
Wanna do, wanna do
What I wanna wanna do?
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Monster influence, in my veins
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Monster influence, in my veins
I've got Duel Madness in my brain
Monster influence, in my veins
