Song:

Hey, Mr. Seeker hold on to this advice
If you keep seeking you will find
Don't want to follow
Down roads been walked before
It's so hard to find unopened doors

Are you ready? Are you ready?
For what's to come... Oh I said Are you ready?
Are you Ready?... For what's to come

Hey, Mr. Hero Walking a thin, fine line
Under the microscope of life
Remember your roots, my friend
They're right down below
'Cause heroes come and heroes go

Are you ready? Are you ready?
For what's to come... Oh I said Are you ready?
Are you ready? For what's to come

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Count down to the change in life that's soon to come
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Count down to the change in life that's soon to come
Your life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun

Are you ready? Are you ready?
For what's to come... Oh I said Are you ready?
Are you ready? For what's to come
Oh I said Are you ready?
Are you ready? For what's to come
Your Life has just begun
Life has just begun
Life has just begun
