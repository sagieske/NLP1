Song:

I shouldn't have done that
I should've ignored it
Like something I could not see
Like something I cannot see
Ah... Yeah
I shouldn't have ever looked at you
I should've ran away
I should've acted like I didn't hear
Like something I could not hear
Like something I cannot hear ah... Yeah...
I shouldn't have listened to my heart at all
Without a word
You showed me what love is
Without a word
You gave me your love
You even made me hold my breath
Waiting for you
But you ran away like this
Without a word, you left me
Without a word, you threw me away
What should I say next?
My closed lips were surprised
Coming without words

Why does it hurt so much?
Why does it keep on hurting me?
Even though you're not here anymore
Though everything is the same
Without a word
You showed me love

Without a word
You gave me your love
You made me hold my breath
Waiting for you
But you run away like this
Without a word, you left me
Without a word you threw me away
What should I say next?
My closed lips were surprised
Without a word my tears fell
Without a word my heart breaks

Without a word, I will wait for your love
Without a word, I'm hurt because of love
I zone out
I became a fool
I cried as I look up at the sky
Without a word, goodbyes found me
Without a word, goodbyes came to me
I think my heart was surprised
I couldn't even prepare to send you away
Without a word it came
Without a word it went
Without a word it left
Like a fever before
I'll only hurt you for a while
And will only left you scars in the end
