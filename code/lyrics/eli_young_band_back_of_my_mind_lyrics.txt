Song:

I heard she asked about me from a friend the other day
He said as far as he knew I was doing fine.
Memories came back one single moment
Like the night she left headed for the state line

Call me a dreamer but I'm not afraid to dream
In the back of my mind I can picture the whole scene

What if we fell in love again in our hometown
Somehow, someway, fate brought us back around
We'd joke about the past remember the good times
When it comes to you these thoughts run through the back of my mind

I remember when we'd talk on her back porch
She said she wanted a simple like nothing less and nothing more
And all that I could give was not enough to tie her down
I find myself praying that she'll come back around

Call me a dreamer, but I'm not afraid to dream
In the back of my mind I can picture the whole scene

What if we fell in love again in our hometown
Somehow, someway fate brought us back around
We'd joke about the past remember the good times
When it comes to you these thoughts run through the back of my mind

**Solo**

What if we fell in love again in our hometown
Somehow, someway fate brought us back around
We'd joke about the past remember the good times
When it comes to you these thoughts run through the back of my mind
Oh... Oh... Yeah... Yeah...

I heard she asked about me from a friend the other day......
He said as far as he knew I was doing fine
