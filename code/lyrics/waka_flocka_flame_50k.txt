[Intro: Flocka]
I'm drinking champainge one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad b***h with me wonder where my manners go
I'm drinking champainge one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad b***h with me wonder where my manners go
My young is sick sick we're the antidote
Hey man that's your top bust you cantaloupe
I'm drinking champainge one deep in my phantom ghost
Bad b***h with me wonder where my manners go
My young is sick sick we're the antidote
Hey man that's your top bust you cantaloupe

[Verse: Flocka]
You fought a sick and he's still selling dope
How the f**k you ballin' with a car note
I'm in the trap real s**t
Cury never had a job he always loose the booth
Them youngers run up in your house with them hands hold
No manners just to let you know who did it ho
I'm from Riverdale all I know is get it in
I got weed I got Molly's what you tryin' to spend

[Hook:]
50k for a show and my n****s sellin' swag
She a red bottom b***h for such a short working bag
I'ma get money n***a don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my f*****g house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the benz I be playing with a chick x4

[Verse: Flocka]
My foreign car penny flag black
My girl hiped out as fat
Paparazzi keep flashing pictures
Broke n****s looking wanna be these n****s (Pussy)
4 grams in my back wood, (I'm smoking)
Millionaire n***a still keep it hood (Riverdale)
Pay the extra 60 for that still hood
Phantom goals got a n***a living good
Turn up
I be your b***h want a n***a
Hey come here shawty
I bet she wanna f**k a n***a
Hey come here shawty
Never be a broke n***a
Shawty see a platinum n***a

[Hook:]
50k for a show and my n****s sellin' swag
She a red bottom b***h for such a short working bag
I'ma get money n***a don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my f*****g house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the benz I be playing with a chick x4

[Verse: Gucci]
Gucci Mane I'm the f*****g man pocket full of zen
Whipping plans on the n***a grands change a n***a plans
Still know we keep it real chopping off your head
I'm leaving grounds, I'ma try the crown and I'm in the van
Say he hard and he goin' ham I don't give a damn
Say he broke and a hundred million just went through his hand
I don't cherish it I'm flying terrorist and crush you down
If you thinking he gon' take my grounds I'ma change your plan
You are a jam p***y n***a but I just came from Japan
I'm making fans off of growing weed super duper scram
I heard you found and jerked on your man now your n***a ran
Flockaveli you know that's my man called the kid a damn

[Hook:]
50k for a show and my n****s sellin' swag
She a red bottom b***h for such a short working bag
I'ma get money n***a don't use the carlot to protect
Before I leave my f*****g house grab my pistol and my flag
Thumbing through the benz I be playing with a chick x4
