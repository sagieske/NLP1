Song:

In 1994
Something else took control
They came to grab me
As I was sleeping in my bed

They move fast
Watch over your thoughts
(To doubt that it wants in)
(And try to stay in my brain)

Suddenly I was in another room
Terrified, tried to scream, (cannot move)
Paralyzed with fear
Where am I?
(Is this the end?)

(Some say it's the chosen one)
(What's the way/what's going)
(I have been through what they like)
(I knew they would come.)

I must have fainted
'Cuz when I woke up
They were all gone
WHAT'S GOING ON!

Now when I look back, I remember
(To the night calls for me
I could not move or scream)
The fear, (and that's all I
Lost all feelings)
Will they ever leave me alone?

[Repeat the "I must have fainted" verse]
