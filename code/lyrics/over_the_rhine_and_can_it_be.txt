Song:

This night is so big
This night has stars falling
Into my hands
And if I listen real close
I can hear some distant train
Crossing, crossing
(It makes me wonder)
Cast your shadow
Cast your shadow
Across my heart
Investigate me
I hope I've been yours
Right from the start
(It makes me wonder)
And can it ever be
I would know
Experience
The casualty
Of your love
All I can ever see
Is the need
Climb out of here
Find the way to some
Quiet place
Where you are
This night is so dark
This has silence
And very little fear
Tell me this welcome peace
Isn't dancing with the ghost
Of future tears
(It makes me wonder)
And can it ever be
I would know
Experience
The casualty
Of your love
All I can ever see
Is the need
Climb out of here
Find the way to some
Quiet place
Where you are
See how the road melts
Hear how the flowers fall
Feel how the smoke rolls
In front of my eyes
See how the trees bend
Hear how the heavens hush
Feel how the earth fades
In front of my eyes
And can it ever be
And can it ever be
And can it ever be
No
Please no
