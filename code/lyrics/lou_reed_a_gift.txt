Song:

I'm just a gift to the women of this world
I'm just a gift to the women of this world

Responsibility sits so hard on my shoulder
like a good wine, I'm better as I grow older, and now -

- I'm just a gift to the women of this world
I'm just a gift to the women of this world
I'm just a gift to the women of this world

It's hard to settle for second best
after you've had me, you know that you've had the best
and now you know that -

- I'm just a gift to the women of this world

(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)

Responsibility sits hard on my shoulder
like a good wine, I'm better as I get older, and now -

- I'm just a gift to the women of this world
You know that I'm just a gift to the women of this world
just a gift now

(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world, just now)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world, just a gift)
(I'm just a gift to the women of this world)
I'm just a gift to the women of this world
I'm just a gift to the women of this world
....
