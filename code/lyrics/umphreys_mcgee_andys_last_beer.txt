Song:

Whether to mind, partly blind changes wrong or right, do you qualify?
Not to dispraise what it is that I cannot change so am I to blame?
What's the excuse, could it make yours
The one to try are you justified?
Don't even ask the argument is already stained should it be exchanged?


Gimme a reason, what's in your brain?
