Song:

From the very first time I laid my eyes on you
You made my sun shine, made my skies blue
I told you that I had to have you 4 myself
I want you, pretty mama, nobody else

Chorus:
I got my groove on, baby let's go
I got my groove on baby, let's go
You and me girl
I got my groove on baby, let's go
I got my groove on baby, let's go
You and me

You used 2 break my head talkin' bout jah
And now I know Him and I gotcha
Him, you and me and my baby girl
We're all livin'4 the new world

Chorus

A little blue book and a lot of time
I finally got the truth and I made it mine
And now you might hear me knockin' on your door
Grab your book back, baby, cuz' here we go

Chorus

I keep groovin', I gotta keep it groopin'
I keep groovin', I gotta keep it groopin'

It's in my heart, yeah, I got it deep in my heart
It's in my heart, yeah, I got the truth in my heart

Chorus
