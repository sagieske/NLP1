Song:

I'm sailing away, I set an open course for the virgin sea
And I've got to be free
Free to face the world that's ahead of me

On board I'm the captain, so climb a board
We can search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on

I look to the sea, reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had

We've been happy forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold
But we'll try as best as we can to carry on

On board I'm the captain, so climb a board
We can search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try to carry on
To carry on, to carry on
