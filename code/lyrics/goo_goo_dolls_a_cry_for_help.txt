Song:

It's a neverending world out there
And you and I made it this far
but believe me there's things about me you don't know

And who do I turn to?
Where do I run?
Who do I seek, cuz baby it's a cry for help.

I never knew just how one little word can hurt
I never thought I could feel like that
But you and me It's not gonna last
Forgive and forget, yeah forgive

And who do I turn to?
Where do I run?
Who do I seek, cuz baby it's a cry for help

Yeah baby it's a cry for help.
