Ooh
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...
Yeah... Yeah... Yeah...
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...
Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...

See, everybody needs someone by their side
And I can't go on without you another night
Since companionship's been gone
My life has been so slow without you, you

See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love
You
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need
You
See, if you believe that you and me can change the
World someday
Then you'll believe me when I say

I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided

So what do you think, let's get back together (Let's
Get back together)
There's nothin' it could hurt, it could only get
Better
Think of what it last felt like for you and I to turn
Out nice
Into forever, see

See, it don't take a rocket scientist to know I love
You
And it don't take a rocket scientist to know I need
You
See, if you believe that you and me could change the
World someday
Then you'll believe me when I say

I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I decided

Never dreamed I'd be so happy and sure of myself
Baby, life without you is so dark (So dark, so dull)
Now I know it'll never be me lovin' someone else
This precious love, you're my shining star

I remember when we first fell in love
I was too young to know what it was
I couldn't address what made me melt
But quick to tell you how it felt
That love was so real and it still is

I still love you
I still love you
I decided I still love you
I still love you
I still love you (Just think of the things we planned
To do, me and you)
I still love you (Like changing the face of good love,
What's new)
I still love you (So long as the sun is yellow, oceans
Are blue)
I still love you (We can laugh and cry when days are
Through)
I decided I still love you
