Song:

You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face

God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I wanted

I don't know why I'm scared
Cos I've been here before
With every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know, if you never try
To forgive your past, and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be, your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on
And give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
Do you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name

Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared
Cos we've been here before
With every feeling every word
I've imagined it all

You'll never know 
If you never try
To forgive my past 
And simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worth it
To hold in your arms
So come on
And give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile 
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy
Giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy
Giving up your heart (nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy (trust me I've learned it)
Giving up your heart (nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy (trust me I've learned it)
Giving up your heart (nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy (trust me I've learned it)
Giving up your heart (nobody's perfect)
I know it ain't easy (trust me I've learned it)
Giving up your heart 

So I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms 
So come on
And give me that chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Come on 
And give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
