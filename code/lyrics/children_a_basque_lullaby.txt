Song:

Lullaby, twilight is spreading
Silver wings over the sky;
Fairy elves are softly treading,
Folding buds as they pass by.
Lullaby, whisper and sigh,
Lullaby, lullaby.

Lullaby, deep in the clover
Drone the bees softly to rest;
Close white lids your dear eyes over,
Mother's arms shall be your rest.
Lullaby, whisper and sigh,
Lullaby, lullaby.
