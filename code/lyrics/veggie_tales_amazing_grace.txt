Song:

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

Sleep in heavenly peace
(Sleep in peace)
Sleep in heavenly peace
(Sleep in peace)

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears, relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Sleep in heavenly peace
(Sleep in peace)
Sleep in heavenly peace

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright, shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

Sleep in heavenly peace
(Sleep in peace)
Sleep in heavenly peace

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

Sleep in heavenly peace
(Sleep in peace)
Sleep in heavenly peace
