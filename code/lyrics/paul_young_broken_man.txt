Song:

Broken man

If you feel the hurt is but a kiss away,
close your eyes and take it.
And if you feel that pain can tear you in two,
go ahead and bear it.

You know the words he's gonna say,
still you sit and listen.
And those tender words can melt this strong man's heart,
yours will learn a lesson.

And when you hear him say,
"I don't want your love."
try not to turn away,
ooh.

A broken man almost died of a broken heart.
A broken man, that's what I am.

And when you think you've had enough
just say stop, I understand.
You'll stop your tears from building up inside,
baby, stop your trembling hands.

And when you hear him say,
"I don't want your love."
try not to turn away,
ooh.

A broken man almost died of a broken heart.
A broken man, that's what I am.
I'm a broken man,
ooh.

- Paul Young & Ian Kewley
