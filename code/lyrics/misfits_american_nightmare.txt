Song:

Hot cherry on friday night
When the sun goes down my spine
I put an axe in my baby's head
I'm gonna end up doing time

She looks so good in red
American nightmare running scared

She shoulda been hard to get
She shoulda been hard to kill
She shoulda been hard to kill, hey

I had to split your head
American nighmare running scared

I'm heading down the highway
Sign has three inverted nines
If the lord don't get me the devil will
But not without a fight

Does this highway never f*****g ends
American nightmare running scared
American nightmare running scared

I'm heading down the highway
Sign has three inverted nines
If the lord don't get me the devil will
But not without a fight

This highway never f*****g ends
American nightmare running scared
Hey, american nightmare running scared
