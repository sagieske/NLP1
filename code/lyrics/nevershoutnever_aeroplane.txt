Song:

(Hey!)
Life's a dream, and we are the dreamers.
And lately I've been dreamin' of you.
(Ooh!)
Call me crazy,
But maybe, baby,
Imma hoppin' on an aero-plane
To see you again.
My friends are gonna hate me.
I told 'em I was leavin' on an airplane
To the Big Apple,
To get into some trouble.
But honestly, I
Would rather see you
Than be sleepin' around, bein' a clown,
Playin' a fool, and then falling down.
I just wanna see you.
(Hey!)

Life's a trip, and this is a journey.
And lately I've been travelin' to you.
(Ooh!)
Call me crazy,
But maybe, baby,
Imma hoppin' on an aero-plane
To see you again.
My friends are gonna hate me.
I told 'em I was leavin' on an airplane
To the Big Apple,
To get into some trouble.
But honestly, I
Would rather see you
Than be sleepin' around, bein' a clown,
Playin' a fool, and then falling down.
I just wanna see you.
I just wanna see you.
I really need to see you...
Again.
I just wanna see you.
I just wanna see you.
I really need to see you...
Again.
I just wanna see you.
I just wanna see you.
I really need to see you...
Again.
I'm hoppin' on an airplane.
Yeah.
I'm hoppin' on an airplane.
Yeah.

I've come...
To see you again.
My friends are gonna hate me.
I told 'em I was leavin' on an airplane
To the Big Apple,
To get into some trouble.
But honestly, I
Would rather see you
Than be sleepin' around, bein' a clown,
Playin' a fool, and then falling down.
I just wanna see you.
(Hey!)
