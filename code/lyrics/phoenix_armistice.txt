Song:

Dahlias they come from me
A Promise to get well.
That ain't working thing that you're no good
Don't worry cause I'm not the kind to kiss and tell.

No dahlias and cherry trees, 
I don't recall them anyway.
Some lovers know it ain't gonna wear out
To each his own the same
Look what you wasted.

When the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Our daily compromise 
Is written in your signed armistice.

And when the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Well, Well decide as always
Here is your signed armistice

It's time to follow, not to heat it up
Requesting this plane as a propeller
In the middle of the course when ambitions are low
Head-on close, hang on before you lose control

The octoagon logo had to rip it up
The semaphore message on your lips
Some lovers know it ain't gonna wear out
To each his own the same
What else is wasted?

When the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Our daily compromise
It is written in your signed armistice

And when the lights are cutting out
And I come down in your room
Well, well decide as always
Here is your signed armistice

For lovers in a rush
For lovers always
Foreign lovers in a rush
Keeping promises
For lovers in a rush
For lovers always
