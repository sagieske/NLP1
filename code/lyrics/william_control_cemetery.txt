Song:

All lies these f*****g wolves deny
Praying all because of fear
It's all because they want you to hear
Lies sheep in wolves disguise
The dark before the dawn
It's the part of you she turned on

I don't believe in god
Like you believe in me
Sunlight to the sinners in this cemetery
I don't believe in love
Like you believe in me
Sunlight to the sinners in this cemetery

Life, the swelling rage filled the sky
You brought hate pills and knives
And this is how the tale begins
It's your life exist and wonder why
When only fails to work
It will only fail to work sometimes
