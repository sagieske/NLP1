Song:

Old Man Sunshine, listen, you,
Never tell me dreams come true,
Just try it, and I'll start a riot,
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare,
Ever tell me she will care,
I'm certain, It's the final cutain.

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell me fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love, but not for me,
A lucky star's above, but not for me,
With love to lead the way,
I found more clouds of grey,
Than any Russian play could guarantee.

I was a fool to fall, and get that way,
Hi ho! Alas! And also Lack a day!
Although I can't dismiss,
The memory of her kiss,
I guess she's not for me.

It all began so well, but what an end,
This is the time a fella needs a friend,
When every happy plot,
Ends in a marriage knot,
And there's no knot for me.
