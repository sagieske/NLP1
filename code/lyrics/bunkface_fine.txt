Song:

Why is it everytime I try
It always comes back as a lie
I could believe in the words that you say to me
But lately I think I wont agree

What makes the world go by
If you cannot crush my life

What holds you up so high
When you want it all the time

(C/o)
Coz we will be fine
In matter of time
Subject to my mind
As were crossing the line

Directions to see
Perfection to be
A pain of a kind
Always crashing on me

Suffercate, time, matter I'll be fine
Today

And the days they go on and on
As all the time I'm all alone
It never pays me to say that I'm not ok
But you still have time to make fun of me

What makes the world go by
If you cannot crush my life

What holds you up so high
When you want it all the time

(C/o)

And I don't believe
In time we will see
A pain of a kind
Always crashing on me

Suffercate, time, matter I'll be fine

Today...
