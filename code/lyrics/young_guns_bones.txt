Song:

Down under the night sky
I lay in wait
Praying to whoever would listen to me.
I'd fashioned my own cross,
Been crushed by it's weight
There's no stronger message
Than dirt in your face.

I've seen down the end of the road
Now I deal in a different story, oh
And I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
I'll do this on my own. (o-o-oh bones o-o-oh bones o-o-oh bones)

They say the spirit's willing
But the flesh is always weak
Well I found everything I needed right beneath my skin - oh.

I've seen down the end of the road
Now I deal in a different story, oh
And I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
I'll do this on my own.

[Instrumental]

We're all architects of our own private hell
No-one can hurt us like we hurt ourselves

I've seen down the end of the road
Now I deal in a different story,
And I will never let go again
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
I feel it in my bones, bones, bones
And I know I'm not alone.
(O-o-oh bones bones o-o-oh bones o-o-oh bones)
