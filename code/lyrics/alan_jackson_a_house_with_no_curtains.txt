Song:

We still wear our rings, we still say I love you
We both play the part oh so well
But everyone knows it's just a sad show
And we're only fooling ourselves

It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide

We could pack up and leave in different directions
If we just had somewhere to go
We just keep on pretending afraid of the ending
Admitting what everyone knows

It's like living in a house with no curtains
The whole world can see what's inside
You can turn out the lights in a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide

You can turn out the lights
In a house with no curtains
But heartache has nowhere to hide
