Song:

Break the darkness!

Howling wolf prowling around in the broken city
His gray crows want victim for own desire
People who lost their dream passing by him
The tusk of him hunger for blood is ready to strike

Voice saund under the ground
Is there chuckle of the gods!

Howling wolf prowling around in the broken city
He don't afraid the death of him that may come tommorow
People who lost their dream passing by him
When his eyes shine at the victim he attack to them

Fire grow up from the ground
Is there chuckle of the gods
Is there tears of the gods (hey!)
No more tears! No more tears!

Fire grow up from the ground
Is there chuckle of the gods (hehehe)
Is there tears of the gods (hey!)
No more tears!

Fire grow up from the ground
Break! Break! No more this legend
Break! Break! No more this town
