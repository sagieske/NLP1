Song:

I've ordered some rain for tomorrow
The sky will be sunny but wet
And out of nowhere you're suddenly there
And I say, “Yeah, pardon me, haven't we met?”

I've ordered some sunshine with showers
And I've got my scenery set
Right there with a thump our umbrellas gonna bump
And I say, “Yeah, yeah, pardon me, haven't we met?”

Accidents can happen
And into one I'm gonna slide
There's a good chance to get my hands
On a little romance when two hearts collide

And I know that's just how it happened
When Romeo met Juliet
Somewhere I've read that old Romeo said
“Pardon me, haven't we met?”

And I know that's just how it happened
When Romeo met Juliet
Somewhere I've read that old Romeo said
“Pardon me”, oh, he said, “Pardon me”
He said, “Pardon me, haven't we met?”
