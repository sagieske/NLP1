Song:

I don't know how I got here but I refuse to stay.
I betrayed myself when I let others have their way
But I am holding on, my finger on the pulse.
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there's still hope.

But people don't like when you put up a fight.
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am loosing mine.

I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive. Fight.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?
I've come too far to fade tonight.
Fight, or be taken out alive.

My thoughts are racing faster than my body can react.
The danger doesn't register, the fear feels like an act.
Don't pull the plug, I swear this isn't how I want to go.
The sound of my heart pounding tells me there's still hope.

But people don't like when you put up a fight.
And slowly, ever so slowly, I am loosing mine.

I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive. Fight.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?
I've come too far to fade tonight.
Fight, or be taken out alive.

(Whisper)
I've survived on life support, 
But I'm stronger than I give mysellf credit for.
These conditions only cure
When we prepare ourselves for war.

(Louder)
I've survived on life support, 
But I'm stronger than I give mysellf credit for.
These conditions only cure
When we prepare ourselves for war.

I'll fight, fight, fight or be taken out alive. Fight.
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Standing on the edge, am I better off dead?
How could I forget that I'm better than this?
I've come too far to fade tonight.
Fight, or be taken out alive.
