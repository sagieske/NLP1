Song:

I ain't no prophet
I don't wanna cure no damn disease
But would you marry me anyways?
If I was on my knees?
I'm goin' through my time of change
In my time of need
In love love love
Whatever...
So I thought to myself
I'm gonna marry into wealth
Gonna take everything that she's got up
And keep it for myself oh oh oh
She said to me
