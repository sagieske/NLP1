(Spoken Intro)
Since the begining of time mankind has searched for sanctuary from poverty, sickness, and war
Just recently three young men found it
Welcome to Awesometown.

(Begin Song)
Come along with us, come along to Awesometown!
Come along with us, and wipe away your frown!

(Role call!)
Andy! Akiva! Jorma!
Andy! Akiva... Jorma...
Andy! And Jorma and Akiva!

Come along with us, come with us to Awesometown!
Give us all your trust, and we won't let you down!

Dance break!
Stop.

My name's Akiva, the brains of the group
If you have a problem I can solve it for you

My name's Andy, and I like a good sandwich,
So if you have a sandwich, come roll with me!

My name is Jorma, m**********r, the sensitive one!
Break your mot*****in' face with the butt of my gun!
Rip off your arms and break legs with 'em!
Spread your a** cheeks and stick my d**k in 'em!

(Silence)

Come along with us, come with us to Awesometown!
Fun times are a must, in awe-Some-Town!
