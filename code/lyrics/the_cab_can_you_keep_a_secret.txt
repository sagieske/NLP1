Song:

It's true that I'm a silver shadow
And you are always on my mind
You need to get over here
We'll disappear

Your secret's safe
And no one has to know
I'm your getaway
And a little bit more than you can take
I can make
Everything feel so damn good

I could have sworn
We disappeared tonight
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me, baby
And don't you know
I just appeared tonight?
You wanna dance with me
You wanna dance with me all night
Nobody there will ever see us
Don't talk, don't walk
Just the two of us
Dance with me
Dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Dance with me, baby

Soon we're heading to a place
Where I'll prove
I'm all you want and more
You need to let it unfold
Just like you're told

Your secret's safe
And no one has to know
I'm your getaway
And a little bit more than you can take
I can make
Everything feel so good

I could have sworn
We disappeared tonight
Come on and dance with me
Come on and dance with me, baby
And don't you know
I just appeared tonight?
You wanna dance with me
You wanna dance with me all night
Nobody there will ever see us
Don't talk, don't walk
Just the two of us
Dance with me
Dance with me
Come on and dance with me
Dance with me, baby

Soon we're heading to a place
Where I'll prove
I'm all you want and more
You, you need to let it unfold
Just like you're told

Your secret's safe
And no one has to know
I'm your getaway
And a little bit more than you can take
I can make
Everything feel so good

You're secret's safe, and no one has to know
(I could've sworn we disappeared tonight)
I'm your getaway, and a little bit more than you can take
(Come on and dance with me)
(Come on and dance with me, baby)
I ca make everything feel so damn good
(And don't you know I just appeared tonight?)
(You want to dance with me)
(You want to dance with me all night)
Your secret's safe, and no one has to know I'm your
(Nobody there will ever see us)
(Don't talk, don't walk; it's just the two of us)
(Dance with me, dance with me)
(You want to dance with me)
I can make everything feel so damn good
(Dance with me, baby)

Good, good, feel so damn good, good
