Song:

Break down
Break down
Break down

[Verse:]
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I couldn’t close my eyes I was pacing all night
I think I found the light out the end of the tunnel
I couldn’t find the truth I was going under

But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

[Chorus:]
And now I will start living today
Today, today I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Verse 2:]
Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and pain in the falling rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again

But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out
Gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now

[Chorus:]
And now I will start living today
Today, today I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

[Bridge:]
Break down
I was scared to death I was losing my mind
Break down
I gotta get out into the world again

[Outro:]
And now I will start living today
Today, today I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball
