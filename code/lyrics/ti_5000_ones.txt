Song:

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

See me when I walk in, ain't nothin' to it
Brought ten stacks to the back, then threw it
Make it rain, ain't a thang
When it come to money I got it, man

You the next best thang, I'm the hottest, mayne
You talk that shit, I'm 'bout it, mayne
We way over here, up out your range
Don't try to be G, that's not your thang

You try me G, that Glock gon' bang
K I N G, that's not gon' change
I'm rich, bitch, I don't care about no fame
'Cause if all else fails, I got cocaine

Still see me all on TV wit it
Still in da hood what ya need he get it
Dough low 44, see me wit it
If a nigga runnin' up best believe he get it

See us in da club, nigga, we be trippin'
Niggas rap 'bout that shit we livin'
7 or 8 stacks on 2 or 3 bitches
Sucka niggas over there hatin', we chillin'

I ran out of ones, so go back get more
Say shawty, bend it over back, real slow
Jack dat ass up, grab that pole
Show me you 'bout that action, hoe

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no

Eeenie, meenie, miny, moe
I'm lookin' for the direction this money 'bout to go
I'm 'bout ta blow, we pop bottles
Me and the whole clique certified shot callas

Blow top dollas
Got this bitch jumpin' off the chain like Rottweilers
5000 ones, throw 'em then stop
See I'm lookin' for the baddest bitch
Splurge for a second when I'm done you can have this bitch

5000, 10, 000, 20
Ones in my hand, that's good money
Ones in my fan, we get money
She pop that thang, she get that

That money's fallin' like rain
I'm VIP that's champagne
I'm K I D do my thang
And yes, indeed, I got change

Or shall I say I got paper
Stacked money tall as skyscrapers
Hater's you fly I fly paper
She pop that thang she get that

She make it hot like wasabi
Look at that body on mommy
She probably stand right beside me
And I tsunami lil' mommy

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

They call me Young, my money long
I make it rain, now loose your thong
Now loose your bottoms, now loose your tops
You saw what I just spent, I could've bought a watch

I could've bought a car, maybe a couple bricks
I send my hood bitch the fifths on a shoppin' trip
5000 ones, ya you know young wit it
So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it

Still Mr. Magic City, you know no replacements
This is what I do I got a pole in my basement
If I can make it to Onyx, I bring Onyx to the condo
Call lil' bro bring me 20 grand pronto

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no

It's the Twista and can't nobody hold him
The money the stacks that we makin' you can't fold 'em
Get love in the strip club
Gotta nigga feeling so freaky they askin' is you roamin'

Yeah, makin' it rain is automatic when
She's askin if you trickin' you got it
Pimpin' is a habit from Twista magic city
And the muthafuckin' betta bet not bitch about it

Steady stackin' paper that's the reason we be throwin' it up
Dollas at the coke, they slang d
Really lil' mamma all over Dj Drama
And T.I. Joc and Nelly when we in da club

I'ma pop a couple of bottles and I'ma start that good shit up
Got 5000 ones and I'm about to throw it up
Sip on some that Patron
I'ma 'bout put a hundred on one of them thongs

Gotta cup a lil' somethin' 'cause I pay the bill
Still money ain't shit, I make major deal
Better ring the alarm, here come the paper
Twista comin' in the club when I get I pop a lot
When she come up wit a fatty I gladly tip her
Jazze, tell 'em what I got

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

I'm lookin' for her I'm lookin' for her
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no
