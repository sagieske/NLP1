Song:

Say a little prayer for me
Cupid, shoot your arrows into me
I fell lust like a sick disease
And my blood ignites when I hold you close to me

And I'll never let you go
Cupid
I'll never let you go
(I'll never let you go)

Bring my lover to her knees
Pierce her skin and make her fall in love with me
'Cause I swear I'll make you bleed
If you break my heart when I hold you close to me

(Cupid)

And I'll never let you go
Cupid
I'll never let you go
(I'll never let you go)

I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
