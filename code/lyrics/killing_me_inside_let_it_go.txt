Song:

I try so hard to make you mine but it's so hard
You said that you just wanted
Me and I'm not sure

But you don't care you make me so down
Don't try to hide with everything we've got
So I'll take my time to get you now
I know you'll never understand

So I'll take my time to get you now
I know you'll never understand

You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end, just let it go
You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end

I took a change
I took a fall yes I was blind
And now I see everything was gone, just let it go

But you don't care you make me so down
Don't try to hide with everything we've got
So I'll take my time to get you now
I know you'll never understand

So I'll take my time to get you now
I know you'll never understand

You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end, just let it go
You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end
Tonight will never end

Just let it go I tell you now
Just walk away and don't look back
Just let it go I tell you now
Just walk away and don't look back
Don't look back

You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end, just let it go
You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end

You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end, just let it go
You take your way when everything feel's wrong
Tonight will never end
