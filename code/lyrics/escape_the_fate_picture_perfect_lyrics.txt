Song:

You lived your life like you were on fire,
But how can I dance, when your soul just lifted me higher and higher and higher?
Paint bleeds, ink runs, image of your love.
Your memory, our history (why did you have to go?)

I give up my eyes, to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect,
Even if I were blinded.
But you have to die, for me to see how to live.

(For me to see how, how, how,
For-for me to see how, oh,
For me to see how, how, how,
For-for me to see how oh)

I live my life hiding in shadows but now I can see,
Cause your soul is lifting me higher and higher and higher.
Paint bleeds, I can't breathe, need you here with me.
Close my eyes, I can feel you close, why did you have to go?

I give up my eyes, to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect,
Even if I were blinded.
But you have to die, for me to see how to live.

Angels fall, it's not your fault,
Time goes on without you (without you).
Goodbye old friend, we'll meet again,
Life goes on without you.

(Why did you have to go?)

I give up my eyes, to see you one last time
And I'd give all my fingertips to touch you
And I could paint you picture perfect,
Even if I were blinded.
But you have to die, for me to see how to live.

(For me to see how, how, how,
For-for me to see how, oh,
For me to see how, how, how,
For-for me to see how oh)

(For me to see how, how, how,, for me to see how to live,
For me to see how, for me to see how, oh)
