Song:

Just give me a chance for final romance
I'm not a judging man
Your love is so advanced
You got me begging on my knees and my hands
You got me so stressed, it's hard to forget
How to seduce in English
Baby I want you bad
So why do you make it so hard to say yes

You, you, you got me feeling like I don't know
If I wanna stay, if I wanna go
I think I've lost all my control
You got me feeling loco

Adios
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love
Adios
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love

My heart's on the floor
Thirsty for more
I promise I'll walk out the door
Just give me one last pour
Drowning my sorrows in whiskey shots
Wish I could say no, wish I could just go
But you got my sentimento
Goddamn, I want you bad
If you want me to say, baby just let me know

You, you, you got me feeling like I don't know
If I wanna stay, if I wanna go
I think I've lost all my control
You got me feeling loco

Adios
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love
Adios - dl
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love

Adios

I'm going loco
Baby don't you know I'm going loco
You got me feel crazy I don't know
If I should stay, if I should go
Loco
Baby don't you know I'm going loco
You got me feel crazy I don't know
If I should stay, but I have to go

Adios
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love
Adios - dl
Hola hay que seguir a Dios
Got me going loco
Loco, loco, loco
Crazy for your love

Adios
