Song:

The time is close now, the end is near
My walk through the valley, trails of fear
I feel empty, my penance overdue
I guess it's too late now
To be with you
I'm extremely frightened of what will surely be
I sold myself, the death of me
I know you can't forgive me
I know I'm on my own, I've betrayed you
I walk alone

What exactly is the meaning of this
Just pawns in your twisted game
Severe pain for the lie I'm livin'
For a love I never could betray

[Bridge:]
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
And your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
And your own destiny

Lord I pound my fists at you
Won't you just let me die
Would I not suffer enough
No inner peace no after life

[Bridge:]
Question me not say the lord unto thee
You have chosen your own fate
And your own destiny
Denied of this life, is what you are to be
You have chosen your own fate
And your own destiny

I did what I thought was right
All for the love of my life
I know it's sad but true
Something is very wrong
Condemned to suffer so long
For a love so true

The question that lies within
Is so hard to understand
It still tears at me
And in my dying breath
My heart holds no regrets
I would'nt change a thing

My spirit begins to rise into the heavenly skies
Just to be shunned away by you
Now all I want is to die, no streets of gold in the sky
And I wash my hands of you

[Bridge:]
Rising to the heavens light
Just to plea for death
Just to be denied
