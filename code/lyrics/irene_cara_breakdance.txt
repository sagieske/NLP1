Song:

Well
What's this new feeling coming out of the streets

Everybody's talking 'bout it wherever they meet.
Down by the corner I keep getting the heat

Then my feet start moving to the rhythmic beat.
Breakdancing
Break out - breakdancing
Break out.
They used to do the locomotion
Do the jerk and the twist

But there just ain't never been nothing like this.
Now popping and locking is a new way of talking

Things will work out for sure spinning 'round on the floor.
Breakdancing
Break out - breakdancing
Break out.
Hearts are pumping
Beat if thumping
Love's the way you're looking tonight
Fever's rising
No surprises
We won't have the time to fight.
Breakdancing
Break out - breakdancing
Break out.
Breakdancing
Break out - breakdancing
Break out.
Breakdancing
Break out - breakdancing
Break out. . . .
