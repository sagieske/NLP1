Song:

Ain't no way
For me to love you
If you won't let me

Ain't no way
For me to give you all you need
If you won't let me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to have and love a man
And that's the way
It was for me

How can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying over my hands

Oh, there ain't no way (Ain't no way)
There ain't no way (Ain't no way)
Just ain't no way baby (Ain't no way)
Ain't no way baby (Ain't no way)
There ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

Stop tryin' to be
Someone you're not
Hard, cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he's got
And if you need me
Like you say you do
Oh then please, please, please
Don't you know that I need, need, need you

Oh there ain't no way (to fade
