Song:

I never walk when I can run
I don't believe I ever could
People try to slow me down
Saying boy you really should
kick back and chill but,
I can't stand still

I called the doctor he said son
I cannot offer you a pill
So I never found relief
Now I've got to move until
I had my fill I can't stand still

Back where I come from
Lifes never humdrum
I wish I could take you there
oh...................
We had the world at our feet
Life was sweet
Aint no doubt
Grab a seat
Check it out!

Oh.............
I though it never would end
but I lost it some how
and just look at me now
I'm tryin hard to tone it down
Gotta watch my P's and Q's
Maybe look before I leap
and then I say "HEY WHATS THE USE"
Aint done it yet I can't foget
How it feels when you dance till you drop
So don't even start to suggest that I stop
I.. Never will
I ca........ A... Nt
no no no no, no no no no, no no no no
no no no no, no no no no, no no no no no no
I can't stand still......
No no no no no no no no no no no no.
