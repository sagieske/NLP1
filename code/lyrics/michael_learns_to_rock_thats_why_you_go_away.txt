Song:

[Verse]
Baby, won't you tell me why
There is sadness in your eyes
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
Love is one big illusion, I should try to forget
But there is something left in my head

You're the one who set it up
Now you're the one to make it stop
I'm the one who's feeling lost right now
Now you want me to forget every little thing you said
But there is something left in my head

[Chorus:]
I won't forget the way you're kissing
The feeling so strong were lasting for so long
But I'm not the man your heart is missing
That's why you go away I know

[Verse]
You were never satisfied no matter how I tried
Now you wanna say goodbye to me
Love is one big illusion I should try to forget
But there is something left in my head

[Chorus:]
I won't forget the way you're kissing
The feeling so strong were lasting for so long
But I'm not the man your heart is missing
That's why you go away I know (Yes, I know)

[Bridge:]
Sitting here all alone in the middle of nowhere
Don't know which way to go
There ain't so much to say now between us
There ain't so much for you (ain't so much for you)
There ain't so much for me anymore (ain't so much for me)
(Aaaaahhh)

[Hook:]
I won't forget the way you're kissing
The feelings so strong were lasting for so long
But I'm not the man your heart is missing
That's why you go away I know
That's why you go away I know
