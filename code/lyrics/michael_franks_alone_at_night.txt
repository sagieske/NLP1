Song:

When I'm alone at night all I do is think about you
Especially when I'm blue I just can't do without
I love the way you shiver my timbers
I need you here to keep myself limber
When I'm alone
I contemplate every way I'd like to rendez-vous you
I only hope s'il-vous plait you can respondez-vous
Your amplifier's already preset
Let's see of we can rattle the tea set
When I'm alone at night
Watching those reruns of Dragnet
Catching those rays of electrode light
Your love pulls at me like a magnet
When I'm alone at night
When I'm alone at night fasting on a love-free diet
I know I'm suffering some overdose of peace and quiet
Hanging on a ledge of depression
Is someone trying to teach me a lesson
When I'm alone at night
I'm hit with some vague kind of sorrow
Crossing the sea on a solo flight
Wishing today was tomorrow
When I'm alone at night
