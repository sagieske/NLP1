1st verse

Christmas will never be the same, 
If you have'nt come home yet, 
It would be a miracle to see you once again

Chorus:
I have enouh of your promising that you would come back on christmas day.
I don't believe you anymore, I am not a fool cause I know that you don't love me anymore

2nd verse

A promise is a promise that we would share the special holiday, just when I thought that it would be real, 
Who am I to be fooled with you, no no no, I can't believe you would do this to me, and I want you to believe that it's christmas day, it's all about love, it's all about keeping promises to each other

(Repeat chorus 2x and fade)
