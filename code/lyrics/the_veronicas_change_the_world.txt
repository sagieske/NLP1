Song:

We wanna change the world
We wanna change your attitude
Yeah we wanna change your life
We wanna give it back to you (O yea)

Another day has passed
Another week has come and gone
I didn't think I'd last
But those are things I did wrong
Say it with a Swing [?]
And I just want my chance with that
Here's my chance to sing
Doesn't matter where I'm at
Cuz we don't wanna fake it anymore

We wanna change the world
We wanna change your attitude
Yeah we wanna change your life
We wanna give it back to you

And we don't know why our lives have come to this
But we, we gotta try
You know that ignorance is bliss
Another week has passed
Another year has come and gone
Life goes so fast
Trying to find where I belong
And then I find myself
In a very distant place
With all my dreams
Taken on a different face
Cuz we don't wanna fake it anymore

We wanna change the world
We wanna change your attitude
Yeah we wanna change your life
We wanna give it back to you

And we don't know why our lives have come to this
But we, we gotta try
You know that ignorance is bliss

I know it's hard to be you
I know it's hard to be young
I know it's hard to see through
But life has just begun
Cuz we don't wanna fake it anymore

We wanna change the world
We wanna change your attitude
Yeah we wanna change your life (we wanna change your life)
We wanna give it back to you (Yeah)

We wanna change the world
We wanna change your attitude
Yeah we wanna change your life
We wanna give it back to you
Oh Ya Cuz we don't wanna fake it anymore
