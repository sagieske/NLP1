Song:

I can't believe that every day and every night
It's getting better with you out of my life
It's like I've flicked a switch and now I'm feeling good
No way of stopping, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes I know I'll feel alive
You will be the last thing on my mind
No regrets, do you know what that means

If how, if now, if when
We'll dance to this track
And I don't care what anyobody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

I can love again tonight

We'll dance to this track
And I don't care what anyobody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Bounce, bounce, bounce
