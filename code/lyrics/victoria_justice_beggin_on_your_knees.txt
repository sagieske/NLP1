Verse 1

You had it all
The day you told me
Told me you want me
I had it all
But let you fool me
Fool me completely
Yeah, I was so stupid
To give you all my attention
Cause the way you played me
Exposed your true intentions

Chorus

Cause one day I'll have you beggin on your knees for me
Yeah one day I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You mess with me
And mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day You'll be beggin on your knees for me

Verse 2

So watch your back
Cause you don't know when or where I could get you
I set the trap
And when I'm done then you'll know what I've been through
So oh mister player do you feel like the man now?
And I'll bet you're nervous cause this song makes you freak out

Chorus

Cause one day I'll have you beggin on your knees for me
Yeah one day I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You mess with me
And mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day You'll be beggin on your knees for me

I know I'm being bitter
But I'ma drive you under
Cause you just don't, don't deserve happy ever after
For what you did to me, after you told me you never felt that way
It was only just a game
(You had it all)
One day

Chorus

Cause one day I'll have you beggin on your knees for me
Yeah one day I'll have you crawling like a centipede
You mess with me
And mess with her
So I'll make sure you get what you deserve
Yeah one day You'll be beggin on your knees for me
