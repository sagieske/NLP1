Song:

I'll show you all of the places I'm dreaming
Of. I'll take you to the Ocean, 
I'll bring the Sun
We are seventeen, we are just begun... 
I have loved a five four and then some
But you are the one
Wake up in the morning, we're
Paralysed... We'll fly into the garden
Like butterflies
There will be no blood
And there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you
Again again again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
Amd you are taking my defences
You are pulling me apart
Forever we're young and we are dying
And will spilling all our blood
So I will take away my feelings
I will be an animal
An animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell eachother lies
Like we tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky and I'll colour you
I want to draw on your skin
Again again again

We will run away from danger
We will run away
