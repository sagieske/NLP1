Song:

English:

My heart, swimming
In the words the wind has borne
A voice, bouncing
On a tomorrow carried by clouds

A heart, trembling
On a mirror where the moon quivers
A star falls, spills
Gentle teardrops

Isn't it wonderful
If we could walk, holding hands
I'd want to go
To your town, your house, into your arms

To your heart
I leave my body
Mixed into the night
I dream

The wind stops; your words
Are a kind illusion
The clouds break apart; tomorrow
Is a distant voice

A heart flowing
In a mirror where the moon has seeped in
A star wavers, spills
Tears you can't hide

(repeat)

That face
Touch it, just so
And dream a dream
That melts in the morning

Japanese:

Kaze ga yoseta kotoba ni
Oyoida kokoro
Kumo ga hakobu ashita ni
Hazunda koe

Tsuki ga yureru kagami ni
Furueta kokoro
Hoshi ga nagare, koboreta
Yawarakai namida

Suteki da ne
Futari te o tori aruketa nara
Ikitai yo
Kimi no machi, ie, ude no naka

Sono mune
Karada azuke
Yoi ni magire
Yume miru

Kaze wa tomari; kotoba wa
Yasashii maboroshi
Kumo wa yabure; ashita wa
Tooku no koe

Tsuki ga nijimu kagami o
Nagareta kokoro
Hoshi ga yurete, koboreta
Kakusenai namida

(kurikaeshi)

Sono kao
Sotto furete
Asa ni tokeru
Yume miru
