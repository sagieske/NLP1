Song:

Ohhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh

Tornados spinning, I sit here grinning
I think we've all seen this movie before
This is confusing, almost amusing
It's hard to tell up and down anymore

When did it get so crazy
How did we lose control
Everybody's shouting how bad it really sucks
Situation normal, all funked up (uhhhh)
We're all funked up

We had some leaders and they all were cheaters
But they came out smelling like a rose
We should just reject them
But we respect them
For what they do when the door is closed

Nothing in this world, a simple man can do
Stand up and be counted
Ain't you had enough
Situation normal, all funked up

Yeah we're all funked up
We're functionally dysfunctional
We're functionally (yeah) dysfunctional
We're all funked up

Ohh
Ahhhh

Don't you know the meaning of the word snafu
Better known as trouble for me and you
Murphy's law will get'cha
He is on his way
Same ol' same ol' shit, a different day

Oh

Tornados spinning, I sit here grinning
I think we've all seen this movie before
This is confusing, almost amusing
It's hard to tell up and down anymore

Everybody's shouting how bad it really sucks
Situation normal, all funked up
We're all funked up
We're all funked up
We're all funked up

Ohhhhhhhh

All Funked up
