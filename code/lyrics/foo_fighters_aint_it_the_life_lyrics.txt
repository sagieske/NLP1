Song:

Dear Haley
Can you save me from the borrowed cloud I'm on
All you gotta do is try
Pray you're just getting by
Hey wait I thought you'd made it
How'd your bottled crown fall off
Tell me how'd you get so tired
Faded down to the wire
Try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise
Wasting time
So very ordinary
Wait until my bomb goes off
See the actors run and hide
Fake it all in stride
One day we all can say we're gone
And haunt the ground we're from
Everything's so open wide
Here within the divide
Try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise
Wasting time
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life
Just sail on by
Try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise
Wasting time
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Ain't it the life
Got no crime
Just sail on by
Sail on by
Ain't it the life
