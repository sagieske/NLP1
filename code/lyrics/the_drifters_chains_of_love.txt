Song:

The chains of love
Are the kind
That bind me to you
And you to me

The chains of love
Are not made of steel
But something deep inside
That I feel

Oh, I, oh, I
Don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me

With your (chains of love)
Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)
Now, that's life, baby

Just a little bit tighter
Just a little bit tighter

The chains of love are
The kind that I can't see
You got the lock, I got the key
But the key's no good to me

I said, I, oh, I
Don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me

With your (chains of love)
Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)
Now, that's life, baby
(Chains of love)
A little bit tighter, baby

I said, I, oh, I
Don't want to be free
Baby, make a prisoner out of me

With your (chains of love)
Keep on drawing me closer
(Chains of love)
Don't turn me loose
(Chains of love)
Now, that's life, baby
(Chains of love)

Just a little bit tighter
(Tighter, tighter)
Tighter, baby
(Tighter, tighter)
And I like it
(Tighter, tighter)...
