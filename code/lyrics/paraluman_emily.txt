Song:

The sun has set and the gray sky fade in blue
Been wanting to say goodbye but it leads me back to you
And the rain starts to fall down
As I watch the stars crash into the night
I wish I could turn, turn back the hands of time

As I pick up all the pieces that you have left behind
My heart bleeds your smile and my soul starts to die

Now I'm screaming I'm shouting I can't hear a thing
My eyes burn and blister I can't feel the pain
I don't know why I'm here
I don't know why I'm here

But I simply can't
No I simply can't
