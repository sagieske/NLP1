Song:

You used me for an ashtray heart
Right from the start
Case of the punks
I feel like a glass shrimp
Make invalids out of supermen
Call in a shrink
And pick you up, with a girdle
Used me like an ashtray heart
Right from the start
Case of the punks

Another day, another way
Someone's had too much to think
Open up another case of the punks
You hid behind the curtain
Waitin' for me to go out
A man on a porqupine fence

Each pillow is touted like a rock
The mother father figure
Somebody's had too much to think
Send your mother home your navel
Case of the punks

You picked me out, like an ashtray heart
Hid behind the curtain
Waited for me to go out
Used me like an ashtray heart
A man on a porcupine fence
Hit me where the lover hangs out

While they crushed me out
You used me for an ashtray heart
Hid behind the curtain
You looked in the window when I went out
You used me like an ashtray heart
Brushed me off while I was burnin' out
