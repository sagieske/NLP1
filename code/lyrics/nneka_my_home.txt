Song:

Is a wonder shoulda the dark the gets dark
Dug dug dug dug
I don't know what
Tomorrow will bring

For you say dat who don't know ha to survive
We never see good
Know I depend oh I'm depend on you â€“ into you

Chorus:
Where do I go?
When this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to
When they book me down,
You are my hope,
Will they all accept me- sure

My beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a hope
Give me some tomorrow
When they book me down,
Oooh you know
You are my home...
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end

All I'm left with is to trust in He- oh no
For my kindness -whoa - decepted me now - oh no
See me weary for I am lon-leey -lonely
Father, Father, Jah oh save me now
For I am dying

Chorus:
Where do I go?
When this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to
When they book me down,
You are my hope,
Will they all accept me- sure

My beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a hope
Give me some tomorrow
When they book me down,
Oooh you know
You are my home...
My beginning, my middle, my end
My beginning, my middle, my end

Bridge:
Where do I go?
My beginning, my middle, my end
To live when they forsake me and they call me I just don't know where to go
Oh

Where do I go?
My beginning... My middle... My end

Where do I go?
When this world forsakes me
Who do I turn to
When they book me down,
You are my hope,
Will they all accept me- sure
My beginning, my middle, my end
When there's a hope
Give me some tomorrow
When they book me down,
Oooh you know
You are my home...
My beginning, my middle, my end

My beginning, my middle, my end...
