Song:

Way down in Columbus Georgia
Lord I wish I was back in Tennessee
Way down in that old Columbus Stockade
My friends all have turned their back on me.

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Many a night with you I've rambled
Honey, countless hours with you I've spent
Thought I had your sweet love and your little heart forever
But I find it was only lent.

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Last night as I lay sleeping
Oh, I dreamd that I was you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken
Lord, I was still behind these bars

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind
Lord, I've got the walking blues
