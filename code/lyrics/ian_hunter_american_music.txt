Song:

(ian hunter)

I have a dream-its only one dream
But I know dreams can come true
And I have a wish-its only one wish
But I know wishes can too

I wanna be-faraway from here
With those honky tonk heroes-burnin' my ears-oh

Love american music-i play it all night long
Just me n' records-n' a vivid imagination
I love to dance in the mirror-i practice every single word
And it seems to me american music-is all I've ever heard
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh it's lonely on the underground
I sit and watch my world go round n' round n' round n' round n' round
I sit and watch the world go round

I hear the sons of memphis-i hear the brothers or harlem
I hear the nashville cats n' the rag time mamas outa new orleans
I hear the windy city-i hear a gospel singers hymn-and it seems to me
American music is all there's ever been

C'mon baby oh oh -oh oh-oo-oo
I love the names of the cities-i hear the echo echoing
And it seems to me american music is all there's ever been
