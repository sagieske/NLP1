Song:

[Verse:]
These aren't the days that will
Tell the stories all
Living on the days of the fallen
A voice that once spoke of strength and hope
Nothing's addict of the hopeless

[Chorus:]
You cannot break
This love we hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
To go your way
A tribute to the fallen

[Verse:]
We done, you done, we raised
And with new strenght
No we just begun
To fight this war with you

[Chorus:]
You cannot break
This love we hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
To go your way
A tribute to the fallen

Walk the path you're choosing
Our fear remains unbroken

[Bridge:]
Even if we die tonight
This is an endless fight
Our spirits will fall
In the hearts of those we leave behind
Broken bones, and the will of stone
In the end we will not stand alone

(Solo)

[Chorus:]
You cannot break
This love we hate
A tribute to the fallen
Your choice is made
To go your way
A tribute to the fallen
