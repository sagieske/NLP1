Song:

Once again
I wanna feel you once again
I wanna share my life again
With you again

Come what may
Whatever other people say
I wanna feel you once again
Once again, once again

For you to love me
Again would be too much to ask
And yet I've tried
But words got in the way
And though I know I've hurt you
Time and time again, just hear me say
For now I beg of you

Once again
I wanna feel you once again
I wanna share my life again
With you again, once again

Once again
I wanna feel you once again
I wanna share my life again
With you again, once again

Come what may
Whatever other people say
I wanna feel you once again
Once again, once again

I wanna feel you once again
Once again, once again
