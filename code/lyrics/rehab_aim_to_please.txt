Song:

Ain't you from Georgia
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
(Brooks)
She tender like tender roni
Suck the meat off the boney
You know that I'm feeling lonely
Make me some macaroni
Cook me a cheesesteak
Sit with me by the lake
Why bother with bein' fake
F**k it, let's mate
Like rabbits and caribous
You know I don't care, boo
Yeah, baby I care about you
Bust a nut over you
All in the family room
Lettin' the bass boom
You smilin' right now
But you'll be washin' your face soon
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
(Danny)
Okay, I'm in a gto, a '66
With this dixie chick
Lickin' Pixie Stix
All in my mix
Can't beat these ho's off me
Tricks and hicks all be kickin' digits at me
Hollin' call me
S**t, like I'm ballin'
Hell and y'all all callin' me
Spaulding, Rawlins to my face
Behind my back, pray I'm fallin'
I'm a lay the law then
I've been where y'all been
I ain't shamed
I've shared an eight ball with lame friends
But when does truth start
And where does the game end
I pushed on the door long enough
And it caved in
Now you're on my ankles
Holdin' on, stranglin'
My neck, no respect ho
I'm not your angle
I'm not gonna be able to pay your cable
I can't get you baby David on a label
So save it
If it was all gravy, maybe
"you done changed!"
Yeah b***h, you used to hate me
That's alright, come by the house around 11: 30
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
(Killa Mike)
Now she's a ball juggler
A d**k smuggler
She thinks I'm lovin' her
But, I'm just cuttin' her
So pimpish, wood grain in the parlor
Golden ball, 24s
Make these ho's holla
Swalla
Even make believe
And everything this weekend
Gold's in my mouth
Damn right, I'm from the South
Lookin' like a million bucks
I did us on some Chucks
Brooks Buford, Danny Boone
Crawlin' all up in your womb
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
I want somebody now
To come lay down with me
I got that dirty South
And girl I aim to please
