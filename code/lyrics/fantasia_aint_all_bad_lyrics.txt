Song:

[Verse:]
Today’s no cares, no tears,
I pray that this means I’m over you,
My, my, my, please God say it’s true.
I don’t wanna live in fear,
Spending my life without you,
I told you bye, bye. Bye, I swear I really mean it.
[Pre-Chorus:]
While the memories flow through my head
Maybe I should take back what I said.
[Chorus:]
Cause it ain’t all bad when you’re around,
But it ain’t all bad all by myself,
Treated me so bad I put you down
I guess it’s just my life turning back to back.
Let it go, even though I want you
Let it go, I don’t really need you.
Let me know, falling out of love, ain’t all bad.
[Verse:]
I think that I made a bad call
When I decided to five me my all,
Yeah, over and over and over and again.
Now I deal the tears screaming down my face,
But this crying eyes, they will never change,
Bet I want you go bye-bye,
I swear I really mean it, cause
[Pre-Chorus:]
While the memories flow through my head
Maybe I should take back what I said.
[Chorus:]
Cause it ain’t all bad when you’re around,
But it ain’t all bad all by myself,
Treated me so bad I put you down
I guess it’s just my life turning back to back.
Let it go, even though I want you
Let it go, I don’t really need you.
Let me know, falling out of love, ain’t all bad.
[Bridge:]
Used to think I never, never ever ever let you go
Now I know better, feeling like it’s best I let you go.
One time for the time, that you told ‘em you won’t let ‘em go
Still time you broke my heart and I can’t run, I’m walking out the door.
[Pre-Chorus:]
While the memories flow through my head
Maybe I should take back what I said.
[Chorus:]
Cause it ain’t all bad when you’re around,
But it ain’t all bad all by myself,
Treated me so bad I put you down
I guess it’s just my life turning back to back.
Let it go, even though I want you
Let it go, I don’t really need you.
Let me know, falling out of love, ain’t all bad.
