Song:

Face to face, I've got to understand
Did you mean to break my heart
Face to face, I got to realize.
Please don't tell me lies

Face to face, I've got to understand
Is it love or is it pride
Face to face, I got to realize.
Tell me what's the truth

If we all could stand together
There's no need to hide away
Would you stand by me forever
Face to face I got to know now
