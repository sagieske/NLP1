Song:

Come in from the cold, close the door from the hurt
That makes you feel alone
Time for you to share that coat you wrap around your life
Lay here in my arms, let me hold you close, I want so

Come in from the rain, shake away all the tears you try hiding them
Tell me every fear that keeps you from this love of mine
Leave it all behind, lay down my side, I'll show it to you

I've been hurt just like you, I know how hard
It is to give your love away but baby it's safe, I'm warm
All I'm really asking of you is come in from the cold

Yeah, I've been hurt just like you, I know how hard
It is to give your love away but baby it's safe, I'm warm
All I'm really asking of you is come in from the cold

Throw off all the memories that can bring you down
Loving is only the way to heal a heart that love has wronged
So baby give up the fight, you know it's right
Come in from the cold, baby you should know, I'd love for

You're my dying love, yeah yeah yeah
Girl I'll make you fall, jump to you from the storm
I wanna show to you and help you, please don't worry about me
If I need you, and I found you and I want you, oh baby
