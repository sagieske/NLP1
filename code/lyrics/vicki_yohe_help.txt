Song:

Sometimes it seems that
Life just isn't fair.
Oh no, no
Sometimes it's like you're
Just too tired to care.

Oh my, my sometimes you
Want to hang your head
And cry. But you are not
Alone, God is right by your
Side. But ya gotta hang on.

Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way

What about when this whole world
Brings you down, He will be there for you,
Your life is out of control spinning round and round, like a merry go round. He hears your prayer,
He hears your cries, but you are not alone, God is right by your side. But ya gotta hang on

Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way
Help, help, help is on the way

For the Lord is your shelter
In the night. He will protect
You by day, keep you from harm
He'll watch over your life.
