Song:

Dolly my love - hey Dolly, hey Dolly
Dolly my love - lovely Dolly, lovely Dolly
Sweet sweet Dolly my love - hey Dolly
Dolly my love

You make me smile when I don't wanna smile
You make me sing when I don't wanna sing
You are the one that brings up the sun

Dolly my love - hey Dolly, hey Dolly
Mmh Dolly my love - lovely Dolly, lovely Dolly
Sweet sweet Dolly my love - hey Dolly
Dolly my love

I'll do for you what nobody can do
I'll be your star, your sun and your moon
Let's give it a try, a hell of a try - try

Dolly my love - hey Dolly, hey Dolly

Dolly my love - lovely Dolly, lovely Dolly
Mmh ooh Dolly my love - hey Dolly
Dolly my love - whoo

We could get married on a hot day in May
Two of we kiss by a white 'do your say'
An' I'll be with you for the rest of our day

Dolly my love - hey Dolly, hey Dolly
Dolly my love - lovely Dolly, lovely Dolly
Dolly my love - hey Dolly
Sweet Dolly my love
Dolly my love - hey Dolly, hey Dolly
Sweet Dolly my love - lovely Dolly, lovely Dolly
Oh Dolly my love - hey Dolly
Precious Dolly my love - Dolly
I love you Dolly, sweet Dolly...
