Song:

She never been on a flight, 
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in LA
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention
She broke my hands on her body
And now she's whispering in my ear

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can't last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for... 

I hope this ain't a dream
This better not be no dream
Please don't let this be a simulation
Cuz you're a pretty thing
I hope it's not my imagination

I'm dancing on the floor
I'm dancing with you, girl
We spin it round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love

I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my mood
On saturday, on saturday
Tonight be for free
Now that I got you
I won't leave you alone, alone, alone
Call your guy phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can't last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for... 

You never know I was kinda go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she's never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like your the man
But deep you know, she's a fan
Cuz she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off cuz you see a sign of frightening
is spinning at her
T-pain is winking at her
Ludacris is with her chick but his homeboys giggle at her

What's the matter? oh nothing
... 
She grabbed my hand, throw me to the dancefloor
We dance closely, and she pulls my hands low

I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss til the morning light

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can't last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last forever
Let's make it last for... 

Let's make it last for... (repeats)

Let's make it last forever
