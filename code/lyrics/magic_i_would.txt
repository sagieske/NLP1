Song:

I know a girl
Halfway round the world
She's been feelin' nought in the room
No place to call her own
All she ever want
Was peace
Caught in a family
Tell me how we got so cold
Only heaven knows

You're bout to sail across the ocean
In a spaceship [?]
Aboard the two way ship to heaven
To rearrange our destiny

[Chorus: x4]
You know I would I would I would I would I would

I know a boy
Lost all of the joy
Living in the shadows of fear
With the devil in his ear
All she ever wanted was peace
Caught in a family
Tell me how we got so cold
Only heaven knows

You're bout to sail across the ocean
In a spaceship [?]
Aboard the two way ship to heaven
To rearrange our destiny

[Chorus: x4]
You know I would I would I would I would I would

You're bout to sail above the ocean
In a spaceship [?]
Aboard the two way ship to heaven
To rearrange our destiny

You're bout to jump in the Delorean
And jump back to yesterday
You know I'll change how the story ends
And you'll be right here next to me

[Chorus: x4]
You know I would I would I would I would I would

You know I would
