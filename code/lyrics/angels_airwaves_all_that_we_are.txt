Song:

The ice is really cold the street lights really old
Her child's all alone as she notes into her own
And slowly fades away and into a river or full of shame
But I least numb to the pain, can you see it?

Can you feel the shallow wave from a needle to the grave
From our hell to faraway your my only
You're so sad my valentine on your journey to the light
But first straight to the fire

[Chorus:]
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are
Holding on until we fall apart
And we are
All that we are, All that we are
All that we are, All That we are
All That we are, All That we are
All that we are, All that we are
