B. C People - Xavier Rudd

Oh the mountains are breathing
As the breeze hits the side
Oh so now thanks for the green peace
Oh my friend lets rip it down the line

Oh yeah these are good people
Oh yeah living for good times
Oh yeah these B. C people
Oh yeah they make me feel fine

Oh oh oh extreme are you seasons
Carving beauty as they rest
All through you I feel welcome
In your land so lush and so fresh

Oh yeah these are good people
Oh yeah living for good times
Oh yeah these B. C people
Oh yeah they make me feel fine

(Shall we put one together, ok why not, hey)

Oh yeah these are good people
Oh yeah living for good times
Oh yeah these B. C people

Uh uh uh uh they make me woooo, make meeeeeee feel fine.
