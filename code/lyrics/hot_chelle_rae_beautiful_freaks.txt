Song:

All you beautiful freaks,
Just grab somebody and light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.
If you're a beautiful freak,
No sleep, light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.

Downtown, spinning around,
Speakers about to blow out.
Can't keep my feet on the ground,
Yeah.

And it's you,
Next to me.
Living super fast,
Blowing Daddy's cash.
Call the cops,
Close the street.
Cause this shit's about to burn down!

All you beautiful freaks,
Just grab somebody and light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.
If you're a beautiful freak,
No sleep, light the place up,
Light the place up,
Yeah.

Get, set, going hardcore,
Crash in through the back door.
Rich, girl, give me some more,
Yeah.

And it's you,
Next to me.
Living super fast,
Blowing Daddy's cash.
Call the cops,
Close the street.
Cause this shit's about to burn down!

All you beautiful freaks,
Just grab somebody and light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.
If you're a beautiful freak,
No sleep, light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.

If you get it where you bid it,
Imma keep on grinning like a politician up on the stage.
Elixer in the mixer,
It's a temporary fixer when you're living in this crazy parade.

All you beautiful freaks,
Just grab somebody and light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.
If you're a beautiful freak,
No sleep, light the place up.
Light the place up,
Yeah.

Just light it!

Grab somebody, Grab somebody!

Beautiful freaks!

Beautiful freaks!

Beautiful freaks!

Beautiful freaks!
