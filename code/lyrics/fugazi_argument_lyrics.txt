Song:

When they start falling executions will commence
Sides will not matter now matter makes no sense
How did a difference become a disease?
I'm sure you have reasons a rational defense
Weapons and motives bloody fingerprints
But I can't help thinking it's still all disease
Here comes the argument
Folderol it's all about strikes now
So here's what's striking me
That some punk could argue some moral abc's
When people are catching what bombers release
I'm on a mission to never agree here comes the argument
Here comes the argument here comes the argument here it comes
