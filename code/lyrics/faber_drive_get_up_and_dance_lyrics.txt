Song:

C'mon and move your body, move your body body
C'mon everybody, everybody move your body

Chorus
No, no body stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance, get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body
No, nobody stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance g-get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body

It's going down tonight
The ladies looking right
Dressed up with fancy shoes
Tight jeans and sweet perfume
The lines around the block
But we just walk right up
We're here to make a scene
Cause were livin the dream
Tonight, tonight, were gonna do it right so

Chorus
No, no body stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance, get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body
No, nobody stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance g-get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body

C'mon and move your body, move your body body

Were lining up for shots
For every friend we got
Lets spend a couple more
Before we hit the floor
And when they start the beat
We'll take it to the street
Oh here's my limousine
Whos coming home with me
Tonight, tonight, were gonna do it right so

Chorus
No, no body stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance, get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body
No, nobody stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance g-get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body

Heeeey yeaaaah
Caught in the moment
You can't control it
Heeeey yeaaaah
This is your chance now
Get up and dance now (Dance now! )
Everybody dance now
Move your body now
Oh oh, oh oh

It's going down tonight
A thousand flashing lights
We're here to make a scene
Cause were living the dream

Yeaaah! 

Chorus
No, no body stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance, get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body
No, nobody stop e-verybody move
Get up and dance g-get up and dance
Move your body b-b-body

Caught in the moment
Move your body b-b-body
You can't control it
This is your chance now
Dance now dance now
G-get up and dance now
Dance now

C'mon and move your body, move your body body
C'mon everybody, everybody move your body
