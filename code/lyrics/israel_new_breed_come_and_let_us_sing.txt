Song:

Come and let us sing
Come and let us sing
Come and let us sing
To the King of kings

Enter his gates with thanksgiving
Enter his courts with praise

He's worthy to be praised
Exalt his holy name
Glory and honor
Majesty and power

Come and let us shout
Come and let us shout
Come and let us shout
To the Lord our God

Come and let us dance
Come and let us dance
Come and let us dance
Lift up holy hands

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
