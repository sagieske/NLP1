Song:

My house in Budapest
My hidden treasure chest,
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

For you
You
I’d leave it all

My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to,
Stop and believe

But for you
You
I’d Leave it all

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My many artifacts
The list goes on
If you just say the words
I’ll up and run

Oh, to you
You
I’d leave it all

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My friends and family
They, don’t understand
They fear they’d lose so much
If, you took my hand

But, for you
You,
I’d lose it all.

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

Give me one good reason
Why I should never make a change
And baby if you hold me
Then all of this will go away

My house in Budapest
My hidden treasure chest,
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo

You
You
I’d leave it all.
