Song:

Girl, you know it wouldn't take much
Just one little bitty touch from you
You could make me feel so fine
If you're so inclined to

If you feel like dancing
Let it show
Tell me anything
But please don't say no

I could get used to you
Oh, darling, you're so fine
I could grow accustomed to
Your body layin' right next to mine

If you would walk on my way
Girl, I'd give my heart away to you
Dancing all through the night
Holding each other tight
Darling that's what I'd like to do with you babe

I could get used to you
Oh, darling, you're so fine
I could grow accustomed to
Your body layin' right next to mine

I could get used to you
Oh, darling, you're so fine
I could grow accustomed to
Your body layin' right next to mine

I could get used to you
Oh, darling, you're so fine
I could grow accustomed to
Your body layin' right next to mine
I could get used to you
