Song:

River rich and mercy beckon
Eveyone who thrirst, is welcome
All who hungers, freely come
Bread of life for everyone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Free for all
Free for all
Over every limitation, free for all

[Chorus:]
Where the spirit, of the Lord is...
There is freedom, free for all

We're proclaiming freedom to nations
Set, and seek your whole salvation
Rivers in the desert... Clouds are forming
Celebrate this freedom out-pouring

Pre-chorus

Chorus

Whom the Son set free, is free indeed
