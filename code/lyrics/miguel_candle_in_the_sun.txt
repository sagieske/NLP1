Song:

There's no separation, we're all one. Right?

Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
(We're all one.)
Wavin the four four.

Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?
Look at all these people
Searching for a reason,
Searching for a piece of mind. Hey!
They say we're all created equal,
That's what they teach us,
But that ain't how we treat each other other other other
Nah that ain't how we treat each other other other other
The truth is that we need each other other other other, yeah.

Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
White colored boy crime, money gets spent
Just candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down.
Heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot got got got
Ohh will it be too late fore we realize?
We're all that we got
Take a look around now
We're all that we got.
Just take a look around
We're all that we got

Business and governments just watch as the innocent play.
Mindless bureaucracy fails, entering government aid.

Are you appalled?
Are you watching?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?

Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
(Oh yeah)
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
(Oh yeah)
White colored boy crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
(Take a look around)
Sun goes down.
(Look around)
Heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot got got got
Oh will it be too late once we find out?
We're all that we got
(Yeaa yea)
We're all that we got
(Yeaa yea)
We're all that we got
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
White colored boy crime, money gets spent
Just candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down.
Heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot got got got
Oh will it be too late when we find out yea?
We're all that we got.
Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Wavin the four four
White colored boy crime, money gets spent
Just candles in the sun, blowin in the wind

I used to think that the world was doing to me.
(Yeah baby)
And that the world owed me something.
And that either the Conservatives or the Socialists
Or the Fascists or the Communists or the Christians
Or the Jews or the Fascists were doing something to me.
I don't think that anymore cause I found out it doesn't f*****g work.
Most assholes just accept what it is anyway and get on with it, right?
So for the few of us who did question what was going on,
I have found out personally not for the whole world, that there's no
Separation. We're all one.
