Song:

Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs.
Remember, forget
The stakes, the ways you take,
The ways you make the moments pass.
For every regret,
I tell a beautiful lie.
And I would die if you find out.
I tell a beautiful lie every time that I
did not open up my mouth.
All the same, it's a game,
it's a play, it's a war,
it's a shame that we're always fighting for.
I don't mean to cast no blame,
I don't intend to pretend, I could, never loved you more.
But in the blink of an eye, everything you ever knew can change
And it's a beautiful lie if you think everything will always stay the same.

Babe.
My babe.
You got a secret - it's starting to show.
My babe.
Sweet babe.
How long can you keep it?
How far would you go?
You tell a beautiful lie.
You tell a beautiful lie.
And it's going to, it's going to drive you crazy.

Babe
My babe.
It's starting to show.
My babe.
Sweet babe.
How far would you go, go, go to tell a beautiful lie?
Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs
Remember, forget
Forever.
Lie.

Beautiful lie.
