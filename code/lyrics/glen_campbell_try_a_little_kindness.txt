Song:

If you see your brother standing by the road
With the heavy load from the seeds he sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Why don't you stop and say:
You're on the wrong way!

But you've got to try a little kindness
You show a little kindness
But you shine your light for every one to see
But if you try a little kindness
Then you'll overlook the blindness
Of the narrow minded people
On the narrow minded street

And don't you walk around the down and out
Just lend a helping hand and settle. Down
And the kindness that. You show every day
It's gonna help someone along life's way

But you've got to try a little kindness..
