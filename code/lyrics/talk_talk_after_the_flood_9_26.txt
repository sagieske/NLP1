Song:

(Mark Hollis / Tim Friese-Greene)
Sang soulless loud
Herding step on flesh and nothing else
To well to drown and drown
Sleight of reason how they come
Cain in number
Shake my head
Turn my face to the floor
Dead to respect to respect to be born
Lest we forget who lay
Who lay
Alone the crowd
Spurning step by static blame something else
Thirsting within, without
Sighted, weeded, how they run
Slain in number
Shake my head
Turn my face to the floor
Dead to respect to respect to be born
Lest we forget who lay
Who lay
