Song:

My girl is hotter than your girl
You know it, you know it
My ride is sweeter than your ride
You know it, you know it
Don't ya wish you were us? (Us)
Don't ya wish you were us? (Us)

You know we own this party
You know we run this town
I'm about to steal your girlfriend
I'm about to knock you down
Sorry, but your train has left the station
Maybe you should try a permanent vacation
Never really got an invitation did ya? Did ya?

Hey! What? Don't ya wish you were us?
Hey! What? Don't ya wish you could rock?
You're M. I. A., we're V. I. P.
You're L. O. L., we're B-I-G.
No one really likes you that much
Don't ya wish you were us?
Yeah! Don't you wish you were us?

Yeah, I score in every game now
You know it, you know it
You ride the pine for nine now
You blew it, you blew it
Don't ya wish you were us? (Us)
Don't ya wish you were us? (Us)

You know we rule this beach, yo
We kick sand in your face
We're gonna crash your birthday
And eat up all your cake

Sorry, but your train has left the station
Maybe you should try a permanent vacation
You're a member of the loser nation
Loser, Loser

Hey! What? Don't ya wish you were us?
Hey! What? Don't ya wish you could rock?
You're M. I. A., we're V. I. P.
You're L. O. L., we're B-I-G.
No one really likes you that much
Don't ya wish you were us?
Yeah! Don't you wish you were us?

Now all the pretty girls are waiting
To get their picture taken
With the crush
Don't ya wish you were us?
Yeah, don't ya wish you were us?
Well, don't ya?

Hey! What? Don't ya wish you were us?
Hey! What? Don't ya wish you could rock?
You're M. I. A., we're V. I. P.
You're L. O. L., we're B-I-G.
No one really likes you that much
Don't ya wish you were us?
Yeah! Don't you wish you were us?
