[Chorus 2x]
I know you caught me cheating
And you tired of me lyin'
Imma be honest with you baby
I know I crossed tha line
If you don't wanna f**k with me no mo than cool that fine
But before you go babe
Can we f**k one more time

[Verse:]
I know I f****d up and sorry aint
What you wanna here but I can't change
That s**t dog it is what it is.
You can go f**k another n***a if that's how you feel
If that's goin' to make you feel better than gone do it hell you asked me about this lil petty
S**t and I kept it real I know that s**t probably hard for you to swallow still I aint know how
Bad I hurt you til' I seen ya tears I aint asking you to accept how a n***a live, if you feel
Like another n***a can treat you better, than it is what it is. But let the truth be told it's
Been my p***y for years. Now you got all ya lil home girls up in ya ear just lets f**k one more
Time before you give

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2:]
I know it's probably best for us to go our separate ways, cause I know imma f**k up again
Anyway but from my fu***n' heart a n***a want you to stay but once you f**k up this s**t can
Never be straight I know that s***s wrong I aint got s**t to say bet you think a n***a didn't
Give a f**k anyway I just had to f**k you good the other day and how that p***y was bitin' I
Didn't wanna scape you rode that d**k so long until you started to shake and I can tell when you
Would nut I can see it in ya face imma miss fu***n' you from the back and how I grabbed ya waist
But most of all imma miss how that p***y taste

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3:]
There aint another n***a who's going to f**k you like I Do you can talk that s**t all you want
But baby you know it's true I know I f****d up I said I'm sorry now it's on you. You can play
Stupid and give me away if you want too. If you say f**k it it's over then I guess we through I
Know if I caught you cheating I'll probably cut you loose don't get it f****d up I ain't tryin' to
Tell you what to do. Whatever decision you make I gotta live with it but whatever your answer
Is just make sure you can deal with it but if we do break up imma keep tryin' to get it this
S**t we going through right now is real silly gone cuss me out and lets f**k and gone kill it.

[Chorus 2x]
