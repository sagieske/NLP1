Song:

There were times in the days gone by 
When I thought I was living, having fun with all the friends I knew 
Now it seems all so long ago 
For my life changed completely from the moment I met you 

Come what may, I will love you forever 
And forever my heart belongs to you 
Come what may, for as long as I'm livin' 
I'll be living only for you 

Now I know I was lost till I met you 
When I met you, love told me what to do 
Come what may, in a world full of changes 
Nothing changes my love for you 

Never ask what the past was like 
I will live for tomorrow, yesterday is very far away 
Now you're here, everything is new 
You are all that I long for, and I long for you to stay 

Come what may, I will love you forever 
And forever my heart belongs to you 
Come what may, for as long as I'm livin' 
I'll be living only for you 

Now I know I was lost till I met you 
When I met you, love told me what to do 
Come what may, in a world full of changes 
Nothing changes my love for you
