Song:

Maybe I didn't love you quite as good as I should have,
Maybe I didn't hold you quite as often as I could have,
Little things I should have said and done,
I just never took the time;

You were always on my mind,
You were always on my mind;

Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely nights,
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine,
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind,

You were always on my mind,
You were always on my mind;

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died,
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied,
If I made you feel second best, I'm so sorry, I was blind,

You were always on my mind,
You were always on my mind.
