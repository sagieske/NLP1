Song:

Baby you can say goodbye...

Tell me what you want, I'm not afraid
Look into my eyes and tell me so
Don't try to hide, no need to lie
I just wanna know
Why you gotta go

(I know)
I guess you got another girl
(I know)
Your love for me has faded away
(You know)
Still you can't seem to let me go

Baby you can say goodbye
Turn away, just walk away
Baby you can let me go
'Cause being with me hurts me more
All the love you gave me,
You can take it back
All your love, just take it back
I'm not gonna she'd another tear
Just gonna let you go

(I know)
Our memories will be fade away
(I know)
But you won't even look my way
(You know)
Deep down inside I'm holding on

Baby you can say goodbye
Turn away, just walk away
Baby you can let me go
'Cause being with me hurts me more.
All the love you gave me
You can take it back
All your love, just take it back
I'm not gonna she'd another tear
Just gonna let you go

(You)
Don't forget about our love...
(You)
The one and only I had was you
Every reason for my life was you, my baby
(Why)
Did you make me believe you
(Why) don't you even deny it
(Falling appart... What should I do)
This is all that's left of me

Oooh, oooh...

Baby please don't say goodbye
Tell me that it's all a dream
Baby please don't let me go
Loving you is everything
Hoping you'd remember
All the times we shared
There's just nothing to compare
I'm not gonna she'd another tear
Just gonna let you go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm not gonna cry no more
Oh, oh, oh, oh
No no, no no
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby I'll just say goodbye...
