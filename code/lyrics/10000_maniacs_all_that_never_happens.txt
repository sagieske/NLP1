Song:

She walks alone on the brick lane,
A year had changed her forever,
The breeze is blowing.
He used to live so close here,
Just like her grey home.
We'd look for places I can't remember.
The world was safe when she knew him,
She tried to hold him, hold on forever.
For all that never happens and all that never will be,
The earth was raw in her fingers,
A candle burning for the love we seldom keep.
She overturned it.
Considered planting some flowers,
No one to tend them.
They wouldn't last long,
It's funny how these things go,
The memories made her weary,
You were the answer to all the questions.
She shuddered slowly,
She didn't want to.
As a distant summer he began to whisper,
She looked into the glass,
And threw a smile her way.
Together present past.
Liquid surface showing that they were melding,
So where can I go from here?
He didn't answer.
The color fading,
So close forever,
She tried to hold him, hold on forever.
She felt him slip from her vision.
In a silent frozen sleep
