Song:

Yeah, I think I’m gonna leave
I’ll just have that one drink
And we’ve all gotta be up early

Boys, we oughta shut’er down
Just take it to the house
‘Fore anybody starts getting crazy

I started walking across the floor
Before I got to the door

Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, I just might have to stay hey
Aw Naw
Look at the time y’all
What happend to coats on
Long gone
I should be half way home but
Aw Naw

Yeah
Girl I saw you come in
With all of your girlfriends
Just cutting up and shooting Bacardi
Yeah
I got my boys with me
We’re just rolling on steam
Not looking to pick up anybody

I was gonna walk on by
You turned around and we locked eyes

Aw Naw
Do you hear that song
Oh one that just came on
C’mon dj what you tryin’ to do
Aw Naw
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw, Aw Naw

No I didn’t mean to be here this long,
And I tried to leave so it ain’t my fault
No I didn’t mean to be holding you
But tell me what was I suppose to do

Aw Naw
Somebody just bought a
Shot of that Patron
Hang on, We’ve been here all night long
Aw Naw,
It’ll be so wrong
If we didn’t dance one more song
Show off, Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw, Yea Aw Naw
Those jeans you painted on
Aw Naw
