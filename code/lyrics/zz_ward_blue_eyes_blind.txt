Song:

I feel the moon hitting the blacktop,
Just like a fuse, making the night so hot,
Forget the truth until tomorrow,
You'll be my Hughes, I'll be your Harlow,

All I know is you stole my eyes,
And was packaged to stone 'cause you put it down right,
All I know is you pull me through,
I don't wanna see nothing if I ain't seeing you,

You're the yellow stars up in my silver sky,
You are a ray, ray, you even make my blue eyes blind,
All of the lights went down when you came with me,
Now there's a million diamonds that I just can't see,

You, you, you,
Make my blue eyes blind,
You, you, you,
Make, make my blue eyes blind,

You set me straight, just like an arrow,
Until we lay, caught in the afterglow,
My world was gray with all the others,
Until you came, you showed me colors,

All I know is you stole my eyes,
And was packaged to stone 'cause you put it down right,
All I know is you pull me through,
I don't wanna see nothing if I ain't seeing you,

You're the yellow stars up in my silver sky,
You are a ray, ray, you even make my blue eyes blind,
All of the lights went down when you came with me,
Now there's a million diamonds that I just can't see,

You, you, you,
Make my blue eyes blind,
You, you, you,
Make, make my blue eyes blind,

There ain't nobody taking your place,
So you don't have to worry,
You got that good ****, darlin',
Ain't nobody gonna try to beat,
It's like you're freezing, it's like you're freezing time,
You make my blue eyes, you make my blue eyes blind,
It's like you're freezing, it's like you're freezing time,
You make my blue eyes, you make my blue eyes blind,

You're the yellow stars up in my silver sky,
You are a ray, ray, you even make my blue eyes blind,
All of the lights went down when you came with me,
Now there's a million diamonds that I just can't see,

You, you, you,
Make my blue eyes blind,
You, you, you,
Make, make my blue eyes blind,

You, you, you,
Make my blue eyes blind,
You, you, you,
Make, make my blue eyes blind
