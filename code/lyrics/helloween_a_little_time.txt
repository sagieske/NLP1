Song:

(M&L - Kiske)

Higher
It's what I expect from my life
It's like a wire
That holds me back down to the ground

Oh I hear you say
"that's the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"

Higher
I've set my limits and bounds
There's a fire
It's burning so hot in my head

Oh I hear you say
"That is the way of the world"
No, hear what I say
"I wanna do so much in my way"

We got
A little time to build up your lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time

We got
A little time to build up your lives
A little time to make up our minds
A little time to fill up our dreams
A little time, time
