Song:

Hold my hand, so I can hold you in my heart
Hold my hand, so I can guide you through the forest of the night
By the sea upon the raging tide

A message to the wind
I must begin to write of love and rain

Touch my heart for it is beating just for you
Hear my song, as I sing it to the lost and lonely ones
If there were time to spend another day

A message to the wind
I would begin if he could blow my thoughts to you

Hold my hand, now it is time for me to go
Take my love and let it rest
For we must meet again somehow

When you're alone and willows start to bend
And rain begins to fall
At times you will pretend and not pretend at all
I'll be with you again

A message to the wind
