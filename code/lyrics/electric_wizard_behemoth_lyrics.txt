Song:

His blackened wings shadow the Earth
This age of fire is his rebirth
Awakened now in these troubled times
He's come to judge us for our crimes

Behemoth
Behemoth

Day of judgment, it has arrived
All you sinners, you're gonna die
The Lord has shown you the way to live
Stop your hate, you've got to give

Behemoth
Behemoth

Were you a slave
And told what to do
If that's so
He's come for you
Did you follow
Religion is a lie
Be not afraid
You're gonna die
You're gonna die

So change now, before it's too late
Or life in servitude will be your fate
Be free, do as you will
Love and happiness, you take your fill

Behemoth
