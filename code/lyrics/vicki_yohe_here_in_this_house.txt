Song:

We've gathered here, in faith we believe
We lift our voices, His praises we sing
Whatever you need, my God will provide
The Father is waiting with arms open wide

Chorus 1:
Here is this house, there is a blessing
Here is this house, He's given a song
Here in this house refreshing anointing
Filling our hearts with perfect love
There's mercy and grace (mercy and grace) falling like rain
Here in this house, (Thank you Lord.)

Here in His presence, there is fullness of joy
There's peace like a river flooding our soul
We see His glory surrounding this place.
There's healing, (healing) forgiveness (forgiveness)
Mercy and grace.

Chorus 2:
Here in this house, (Here in this house), there is a blessing
Here in this house, (Here in this house) He's given a song
Here in this house, there's refreshing anointing
Filling our hearts with perfect love
There's mercy and grace (I feel it, I feel it) falling like rain
(Mercy is falling like raining)

Vamp:
Here in this house, there's refreshing anointing
Filling our hearts with perfect love
There's mercy and grace, (I feel it, I feel it) falling like rain
There's mercy and grace, (I feel it, I feel it) falling like rain (like rain)
There's mercy and grace, (I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it) falling like rain,
(Do you feel it?) mercy and grace!
