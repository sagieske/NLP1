Song:

Use my breath for every line you'll take, when you are lonely, words are holy
A deadly grip on lies, sing to these blood red skies, hail Mary, whisper softly

What you became
(Whoa)
Some things never change and so we

We learn from All Your Hate
We are lost in your mistakes
Play our hymn for the brand new day
We burn, we learned

Here's to your martyr watch her morals bend, an empty stories we grow hungry
To reclaim the notes we lend, you cannot win, when saints are glory I'll die slowly

What you became
(Whoa)
Some things never change and so we

We learn from All Your Hate
We are lost in your mistakes
Play our hymn for the brand new day
We burn, we learned

(We learned from all your hate)

We learn from All Your Hate
We are lost in your mistakes
Play our hymn for the brand new day
We burn, we learned
(We learned from all your hate)
