Song:

As I'm thrown into an empty room, or should I say a box.
I try to turn around to leave but the door is slammed and locked.
So I sit here and think about all the evil things I've done.
I lost where I was goin', 'cause I forgot where I came from.

I surrender,
Put my weapons down.
I can't remember,
What I'm doing in this town.
It's time for me to pack my bags,
I will always be alone.
The only thing I've ever known,
Is out there on the road.
I'm a drifter.
I'm a drifter.

Now every time I look straight into my father's eyes,
I see how hurt and broken down he is from all the times.
He had to watch the son he raised follow in his steps.
The only option that he ever had was to hope for the best.

I surrender,
Put my weapons down.
I can't remember,
What I'm doing in this town.
It's time for me to pack my bags,
I will always be alone.
The only thing I've ever known,
Is out there on the road.

My faith is weak, my soul is bound.
This lonely road I travel down.
I scrape my feet, this jagged ground.
The cuts run deep into me now.
Mother oh, why aren't you here?
So young I was, you disappeared.
I know the truth is ugly, did you truly ever love me?

I surrender,
Curse my mothers soul.
I still miss her,
No matter where I go.
It's time for me to pack my bags, I will always be alone.
The only thing I've ever known, is a broken home.
