Song:

Hear footsteps creak the floor
The shadows give away
Someone outside the door
Won't let 'em in

Life damaged gears to grind
A run down broke machine
That steals your peace of mind
Before you know it's gone

Lay down
Wait... 

Silence burning, hold your tongue
Keep us separate, so they know
Hiding in the darkness under
Boiling to the surface
Stumble, fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 

These things I hate in you
Also reflect it seems
Distortion laced with spite
Teach you how to lean

Lay down
Layne! 

Hiding in the darkness under
Boiling to the surface, somethin' 
Crawling on your skin, discomfort 
Makes you break and run
Stumble, fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 
It's why you never tell me 
Heavens on your mind

It's why you never tell me 
S3v3ns on your mind

That's why you never tell me 
Heavens on your mind

That's why you never tell me 
S3v3ns on your... 

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie! 

It's why you never tell me
Heavens on your mind

A vengeful mind... 
Oh god oooooh
Selfish plans, a vengeful mind
It's all gone
Oooooh
Except for the cross
A vengeful mind just reached inside
