Song:

It's been a long time
Haven't spoken for a while
Been tryin' to do it on my own again,
And I been fallin' on my face again.

It's been a long time
Since Galilee and the twelve
Since the time you died there on the tree
Since the time you set every one of us free.

It's been a long time.
It's been a long time.

It's been a long time
Since I felt really clean.
Since I felt completely relieved.
Since I felt like I really believed.

It's been a long time
Since I've listened to you.
Since I've walked a little way in your Light.
Since I've heard your voice and not put up a fight.

It's been a long time.
It's been a long time.
