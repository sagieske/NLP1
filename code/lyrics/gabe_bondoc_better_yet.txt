Song:

I couldn't be more obvious
About the way I feel tonight
And I couldn't want much more than us
That's the way I feel inside
You, you've been holding back and I'd

Love to find out why, oh why
We, we could move so perfectly
Just come out with me, let's try

Chorus
Can I have one chance?
Better yet, I want one dance
Can I see what you are like when the lights go out (tonight)?
(Do Chorus Twice)

(Repeat Intro)

You say you're not the dancing type
Baby, nor am I, it's fine
Baby don't be nervous, it's cool, we'll keep it natural
No need to impress me, already think you're wonderful
I can see myself with you for a long, long time

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge
Let's get moving baby, we'll cut loose
Let this music show us what to do
And if you take my hand while we're dancing, well, that's alright, alright

I've been waiting for this moment so long
All I want's for you to feel at home
With me, With me

(Repeat Chorus)

Second To Last Chorus:
(* means to let ring)

Can I have one chance?
Better yet, I want one dance
Can I see what you are like when the lights go out?
