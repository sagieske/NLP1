Song:

Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Just something about the boy

[Jesy]
It’s the verse in my head
The words that make stutter
The swag in my step
The change from gray to color
I guarantee that
Oh I found my lucky number
And the feeling that you get
Can’t help but make me wonder

[Leigh-Anne/Jade]
No need to try
He’s just right
He’s got that something
I can’t let nobody tell me no
No I don’t mind
Takes me high
I won’t stop until the boy is mine

[Chorus:]
He’s got me good
I’ve got it bad
He’s got me feeling like a girl gone mad
Got me running around like I’m a love fool
Taking me down I can’t stop
He’s got me up
I can’t come down
He’s got locked and I don’t want out
I know he’s playing my heart and I ain’t got no choice
There’s just something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
There’s just something about the boy

[Perrie]
It’s the first time we met
The lightening to my thunder
The green light on red
The kiss that pulls me under
It’s only for me
If you’re the test I got the answer
And I’m all that you need
Now you finally get the chance to

[Jade/Leigh-Anne]
No need to try
He’s just right
He’s got that something
I can’t let nobody tell me no
No I don’t mind
Takes me high
I won’t stop until the boy is mine
[Chorus:]
He’s got me good
I’ve got it bad
He’s got me feeling like a girl gone mad
Got me running around like I’m a love fool
Taking me down I can’t stop
He’s got me up
I can’t come down
He’s got locked and I don’t want out
I know he’s playing my heart and I ain’t got no choice
There’s just something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
There’s just something about the boy

[Bridge:]
I know you like to take it slow
But I’m running out of time
It’s like I lost my self control
'Cause you are the one
And you know what you’ve done
My poor heart come undone
Baby please

[Chorus:]
He’s got me good
I’ve got it bad
He’s got me feeling like a girl gone mad
Got me running around like I’m a love fool
Taking me down I can’t stop
He’s got me up
I can’t come down
He’s got locked and I don’t want out
I know he’s playing my heart and I ain’t got no choice
There’s just something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Just something about the boy

[Outro:]
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Something about
Something about the boy
Just something about the boy
