Song:

An angelface smiles to me
Under a headline of tragedy
That smile used to give me warmth

Farewell - no words to say
Beside the cross on your grave
And those forever burning candles

Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh, Lord why
The angels fall first

Not relieved by thougts of Shangri-La
Nor enlightened by lessons of Christ
IÒ‘ll never understand the meaning of the right
Ignorance lead me into the light

Needed elsewhere
To remind us of the shortness of our time
Tears laid for them
Tears of love, tears of fear
Bury my dreams, dig up my sorrows
Oh, Lord why
The angels fall first

Sing me a song
Of your beauty
Of your kingdom

Let the melodies of your harps
Caress those whom we still need

Yesterday we shook hands
My friend

Today a moonbeam lightens my path
My guardian
