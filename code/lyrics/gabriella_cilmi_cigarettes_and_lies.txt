Song:

Soon, Soon You'll Sing It Out Loud, You Gotta Stop Before You Go And Let Me Down, Yeah
Soon, Son You'll Sing It Out Loud, You Gotta Stop Before You Go And Let It Down, Yeah

And Too Many Times Have You Shut Me Out

Don't You Want To Come And Play
I've Seen You Too Many Times A Day
When We Go We Fight To Be Sure
See I Can't Leave You Alone

Maybe, Baby, Maybe, Maybe We Could Go Into The Sun, Every Little Baby Makes Me Feel I've Won, Yeah
I Said Maybe, Baby, Maybe, Maybe We Could Go Into The Sun, Every Little Maybe Makes Me Feel I've Won, Oh

Soon, Soon You'll Sing It Out Loud, You Gotta Stop Before You Go And Let It Down, Yeah
Soon, Son You'll Sing It Out Loud, You Gotta Stop Before You Go And Let It Down, Yeah

And Too Many Times Have You Shut Me Out

Maybe, Baby, Maybe, Maybe We Could Go Into The Sun, Every Little Baby Makes Me Feel I've Won, Ahh
I Said Maybe, Baby, Maybe, Maybe We Could Go Into The Sun, Every Little Maybe Makes Me Feel I've Won, Oh
