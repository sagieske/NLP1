Song:

Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face

You don't like my music
You don't have to use it
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release
You don't have to get it
All you do is let it
Then you'll know exactly how to groove

You don't like my music
You don't have to use it
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release

You don't have to play it
You don't have to say it
You don't even have to try to sing it

Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face
Get the funk out ma face

You don't like my music
You don't have to use it
Funkin' is a thing that all of us release

You don't have to get it
All you do is let it
Then tell us our funk did you some good
