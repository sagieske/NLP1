Song:

Hey there pretty girl can I kiss you?
With all you've said to me I think I'll miss you
And she said, "No one can kiss me while people scream
They're screaming for me"

Chorus:

One gun added on to the one gun
One gun added on on on
One gun added on to the one gun
One gun added on on on

Hey there pretty girl what is with you?
Don't you know the love that wants to kiss you?
And she said, "You may dream believe I see
All the people who are in need"

Chorus

Hey there pretty girl I will let you
Do just what you want until I can get you
And she said, "One more gun set free makes people scream
They're screaming for me"

Chorus

Hey there pretty girl please take me with you
With all you've said to me I think I'll miss you
And she said, "Come on man with me and see
We will kiss all the people free"

Chorus
