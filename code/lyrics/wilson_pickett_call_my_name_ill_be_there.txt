Song:

See, the sun is shinin' hot up above
Rain will follow you when you're in love
You may wonder, I get lost in the tide
But think of me darlin', when you're hurtin' inside

Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere
Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere

Nights won't ever get too dark
Days won't ever get too long
Winds won't ever blow too strong
I'll be there to wrap you in my lovin' arms

Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere
Let your love light shine on me, baby
I'll be there to love you endlessly, yeah

Call my name and I'll be there
And I'll follow you everywhere
Let your love light shine on me
I'll be there to love you endlessly

Nights won't ever get too dark
Days won't ever get too long
Winds won't ever blow too strong
Call me, call me, call me
