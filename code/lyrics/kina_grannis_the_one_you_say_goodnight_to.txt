Song:

I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.

Let me first say that you're so charming.
Don't you think that you could use someone to charm?
I would sit back, I would laugh, I would laugh again.
Ohh.
And maybe you'd like someone to greet you at the door after a long, long day.
I'm here for you, if you let me.

I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.

Funny thing is I'm trying hard and it's unlike me to get so caught up in things.
But I won't quit, I won't quit 'til you smile at me.
Ohh.
And I just cry if you don't stop to say hello.
It hurts the longer this goes.
I'd cry for you, if you let me.

I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.

Oh, oh, oh.
If you let me.
Oh, oh, oh.
If you let me.
Oh, ooh, ooh.
If you let me.
Oh, woah.
Oh, woah.
Oh, woah.

I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.
I will be the one you say goodnight to.
