Song:

[Chorus:]
Blessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed.........

[Verse:]
Since thou has walked uprightly
As a light in a dark land
Since thou has placed in thy heart
All the Lord's commands
He's set thee above nations
And cast thine enemies away
He's standing up within thee
So let me hear you say
[Chorus:]

We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed

(Verse 2)
Thou believesth in God only, and put no confidence in man
Everything that does concern me, you placed in it his hand.

Though a host rise up against thee, to try and spoil the day
They'll rush in one road to harm thee, but they'll flee seven ways.
[Chorus:]
We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed
[Bridge:]

We know that God's word
Is clothed in truth and righteousnes
We are his children
And with our heart we do confess
[Chorus:]
We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go

(Lead)
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
Right now the devil is defeated say
[Chorus:]
We are blessed
We are blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed
We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the devil is defeated
We are blessed

Blessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed......

(Lead Vamp)
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favor just you wait,
Now wave your hands in the air, wave them like you just don't care.
If your gonna be blessed any how, somebody say o yeah, o yeah, o yeah, o yeah
(Chorus Vamp 3x)

Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favor
Late in the midnight hour God's gonna turn it around
And around, and around, and around
