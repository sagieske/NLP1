Song:

Never before has a woman ever haunted me
But her magic spell keeps workin' overtime.
Somebody please put her out of my misery
Cuz' I just can't get her out of my mind.

Never again will a woman ever conquer me
It's happened once and just once, is one too many times.
All I don't need is a woman's memory haunting me
But I just can't get her out of my mind.

Never before has woman ever haunted me

But her magic spell keeps workin' overtime.
Somebody please put her out of my misery
Cuz' I just can't get her out of my mind.
No I just can't get her out of my mind.
