Song:

So easily I fall, So easily you reach your hand out,
Quickly will I drown, Know the pulls of all my reason,
So easily will I feel, So easily will your peace surpass me,
Quickly will I trust in anything I think is worthy,
How many times you make the waves calm down,
So I wont be afraid now?

[Chorus:]
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I supposed to do?
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I suppose to do?
(What am I suppose to do?)

How precious are your thoughts?
(How precious are your thoughts?)
And how many of them, you think about me,
Faithful are your ways,
I always feel your grace abound me,
Quickly will I call,
Quickly will you answer my cry,
Carefully will you bring, everything I need in my life,
How many of times you make the waves calm down,
So I wont be afraid now?

[Chorus:]
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I supposed to do?
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I supposed to do?
(What am I supposed to do?)

This narrow road I'm walking,
This world tries to draw,
Whoever will help me fight it,
But you wont face it all,

[Chorus:]
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I supposed to do?
I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall,
What am I supposed to do?
(What am I supposed to do?)
