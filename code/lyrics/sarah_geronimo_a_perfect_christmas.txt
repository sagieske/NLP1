Song:

My idea of a perfect Christmas
Is to spend it with you
In a party
Or dinner for two
Anywhere would do
Celebrating the yuletide season
Always lights up our lives
Simple pleasures are made special too
When their shared with you
Ii:
Looking through some old photographs
Faces of friends we'll always remember
Watching busy shoppers rushing about
In the cool breeze of December
Sparkling lights, all over town
Children's carols in the air
By the Christmas tree
A shower of stardust on your hair
Chorus:
I can't think of a better Christmas
Than my wish coming true
And my wish is you'd let me spend my whole life with you
Repeat ii
Chorus
My idea of a perfect Christmas is to spend it with you
