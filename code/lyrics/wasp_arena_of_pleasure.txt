Song:

I don't know where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there,
All I know is, I'm just going
I ran away from home last night, gone forever
I was running for my life
And I've heard the words of what I should be
Live, Work, Die, I am the orphan of the night

Take me down, I'm coming home, the road to ruins
Inside the pleasure dome
Take me down, I'm coming home, arena of pleasures
Where I belong

I'm in the eye of my rage, where no hurricane dies
I'm in the eye of my rage, where the hurricane lies
Oh, a storm's in my eyes
And like the beast that's in my soul, I'm the restless child
Ah mama, I'm running for my life

I was sixteen going nowhere, will I see seventeen alive
And I was running from the nightmare
I stand at the promised land with fire in my eyes
I'm at the crossroad of my destiny and desire
Oh, God, what will I be
And my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fire
Oh it's burning in me

Don't waste the tears on my wasted years
Mama I'm outta here

They are poisoned snakes with double tongues
Horney hedgehogs who do their wrong
Deaf men and blind worms, they'll be not seen
They are pawns and rooks for a crimson king
They are a government with a parliament of whores
Can you hear the screams from the fame machine
Down in Chainsaw Charlies morgue?
