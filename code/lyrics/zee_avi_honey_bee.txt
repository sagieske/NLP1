Song:

I am a honey bee
Shunned off from the colony
And they won't let me in
So I left the hive
They took away all my stripes
And broke off both my wings
So I'll find another tree
And make the wind my friend
I'll just sing with the birds
They'll tell me secrets of the world

But my other honey bee
Stuck where he doesn't wanna be
Oh my darling honey bee
I'll come save you
Even if it means I'll have to face the queen

So I'll come prepared
My new friends say they would help me
Get my loved one back
They say it isn't right
The bees have control of your mind
But I choose not to believe that
So we'll meet in the darkness of the night
And I'll promise I will be there on time
We'll be guided by my new friends the butterflies
Bring us back to our own little hive

Oh my other honey bee
No longer stuck where he doesn't wanna be
Oh my darling honey bee
I have saved you
And now that you're with me
We can make our own honey
