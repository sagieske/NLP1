Song:

Talking part
Yo, pull over... At the subway. I got this weird feelin just pull over right here

Singing part
I'm gettin a lil tired of your broken promises, promises
Lookin at your pager seeing different numbers and numbers
Call you when you steady hangin wit the fellas the fellas
Hangin wit my girls you always gettin jealous and jealous.
I was with you when you didn't have no dollars no dollars
Hangin at the crib, chillin with your mama your mama
Never funded you never brought the drama the drama
Now you flip the script playa please

No I'm not the one
(Say it again say it again oh)
No I'm not the one
You do or you don't!

Chorus:
You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, no more baby imma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man be a man man
No more no more baby imma do right

You treat me like a lady when you open doors and doors
Then you wanna front when you wit your boys your boys
How you gonna play me when I bought your clothes your clothes
The ones that you be wearin when you wit your boys your boys
I know you never thought that I would have the nerve the nerve
But think about it now since your at the curb the curb
Blowin up my pager say you want a chance a chance
Listen when I say playa please

Chorus:
You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, no more baby imma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man be a man man
No more no more baby imma do right

I just wanna know what happen to our love
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong
When you gonna see how good it is with me
I'm tired and I'm through with all ur little games

Hey boy, you promised me kate spade
But baby boy that was last year
In the eighth grade
And you ain't biggie baby boy so it ain't one more chance
When your friends around you don't wanna hold my hand
And you see a girl stylin and wylin inside the mix
Hoppin out the whips the whips, the five and six
Yes fly chrome so pardon my tone
Here go a quarter go call tyrone

Chorus:
You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, no more baby imma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man be a man man
No more no more baby imma do right

No I'm not the one
(Say it again say it again oh)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm tired of hearin it baby imma do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Never again never again no no)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one no)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again s-say it say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again s-say, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(I can do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the ooooonnnnneeee)

Chorus:
You do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't
No more, no more baby imma do right
You can or you can't can't
Be a man be a man man
No more no more baby imma do right
