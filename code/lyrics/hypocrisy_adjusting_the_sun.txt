Song:

Reach for the sky.
Dare it for quest.
It will make you blind.
There is no end.

Unleash the stars and planets
Solar systems afar.
Is there anyone out there
To end your sad prayer?

Silence.
Terrorists.
Religion.
Antichrist.
You think you know the answer?

Heaven.
Hell.
God.
Satan.
Would not be without the other.

Murderers.
Cowards.
Power.
Money.
It is all for the pleasure.

Cowards.
Martyrs.
God.
Satan.
Would not be without the other.

Religion, a violent machine.
Religion, you think it's presupposed too long?

Silence.
Terrorists.
Religion.
Antichrist.
You think you know the answer?

Heaven.
Hell.
God.
Satan.
There would be none without the other.

Murder.
Martyrs.
Power.
Money.
It is all for the pleasure.

Killers.
Martyrs.
God.
Satan.
There would be none without the other.
