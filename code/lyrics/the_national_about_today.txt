Song:

Today you were far away
And I didn't ask you why
What could I say
I was far away
You just walked away
And I just watched you
What could I say

How close am I to losing you

Tonight you just close your eyes
And I just watch you
Slip away

How close am I to losing you

Hey, are you awake
Yeah I'm right here
Well can I ask you about today

How close am I to losing you
How close am I to losing
