Written by gary barlow

The telephone it never rings when you wanted to ring
When it rings it's never the voice you needed to hear
It's funny how the radio sings the words you meant to say
When you need a smile, you only find a tear
I'm in deep regret I'm trying to forget
But hope you'll never sleep when we're apart
All that I've given, given away,
Is all that I need here tonight
All that I try to, try to forget
It's the more this empty heart seems to fight
It fights for all that I've given away
The day it never goes too fast when you needed it to pass
Every corner of the night loneliness sleeps
And though I'll never hear the answers
To the questions that I've had asked
I often wonder what our future could have been
(what our future could have been)
This deep regret makes it harder to accept
With love I payed the price from the heart
All that I've given, given away,
Is all that I need here tonight
All that I try to, try to forget,
Is the more this empty heart seems to fight
It fights for all that I've given away
When I know the lord of changes slowly turn you upside down
And the pieces of your life fall all around,
And the times it's hard to recognise the place you've always lived
Where's the sun, where's the sky, what is love,
What is life, you are mine (oh-oh)
You were mine
And I'm feeling nowâЂ?
(all that I've given away)
And I feelâЂ?
(is all that I'm living for today)
I've given away, it's all that I've been living for today
(all that I've feeling inside)
Feeling inside
(set the things I'm living for tonight)
Is the more this empty heart seems to fight
Yeah, yeah
It's all that I've given away
(all I've given away, is all that I'm living for today)
Oh yeah
(all that I've given)
It's all that I've been living for today
(all I've feeling inside)
Feeling inside
(set the things I'm living for tonight)
Is the more this empty heart seems to fight
Yeah, yeah
It's all that I've given away
(all I've given away)
Given away, it's all I'm living for today
(all that I've given)
Oh yeahâЂ¦uh.. OhhâЂ¦ohhh
