Hey yo Goldie Loc let me hear some dog (puff)
We gotta go some for the hood that's on the real
Yeah, this is a public service anouncement from the mathafuckin LBC
Yeah, check this out cuzz, uhm,

Hey yo Goldie Loc
Let's do this for the homies in the hood
The dub, waddup
No disrespect to them other hoods
But this is where I'm from
3-2-1 I can't cum
No other way
No way, no how
You know the bowwow do it Long Beach style
To the fullest young nigga row
With my steal I cap home feeling like a O
No he didn't, yes he did
Bank your chin in her crib
This ain't no fed
But now he did
On the other side where the cowboys at
Where the brown blast black
And the black blast right back
That's a fact in the city where I'm from
You betta get ready
Caus here they kitty come cum
Nigga we can dumb on your bitchass
I ain't trippin caus I'm from the oldschool
And I never hesita to blast
See, we be innin
You gotta beginnin to win
Holla back nigga in 20 minutes

[Goldie Loc]
Gimme your mic and watch me brake these niggas
How they figga
Bustas get shot tryin to plot
Blew the dice hit them twice hit a seven
Now Snoop watch me trip when I back your eleven
Mix for licks to double my chips
Some bangers so much I got cheers even go to there
Now back up and watch me stack up my dirt
I steal like G'z when you woke up and it hurt
Watch me try matches no need for no practice
Fuck around and get straight stoned with the package
Dogg get the weed bangin
How the homies feel
If me and you left here for hangin
I feel like givin it up
Caus I'm a young nigga livin it up
Me and Snoop ain't give a fuck
20 minutes to get your C-walk on
You know I get my ride on all on his own
Check this out dog, you don't know me shit
You know I respresent the eastside Long Beach with the crip nigga

[Snoop]
Two's, O's, fo's and hoes

Nigga only fuckin with the real 2-0's

Holla at me, 20 minutes

[Goldie Loc]
We ride
Sliding of to the eastside
Hoo-ride, to homicide
Rollin in the G-ride
So what yall bustas gon'do
When the pimps, bangers and hustlaz smash on you
One for the money
And too for the sjizzo

Smashing for the hood caus I wanted to gangbang

[Snoop Dogg]
Trip

And if the too damn big

Nigga where the pound
Hell yeah I'm from the pound
Nigga how that sound
Dogg pound bounce
I got homies from the dub that bang everyday
I got homies from the hood that do the same all day
I keep my feet real close to the street
And keep my hands real close to the heat
I'm not descreet when it comes to the dogg
I'm a real O like eight-ball
We C now us by the gangbangin
Crackslangin, entertain us
Sippin silver set not to contain us
Askin which one of yall niggas wanna scrap
We can do it G-style
Mathafucker strap
Just like I tought nigga
You got caught
Ol'bitchass nigga droppin all that soul
You see, first thangs first when your a grown man
You gotta get up, get out and get your own man
See, I don't owe you and you don't owe me

Respect your G'z is what my homies told me
So I show real love to the dubs
