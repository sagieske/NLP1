Song:

Awake, awake, you sleepy desert
Awake, awake, it's a-comin' day
Stick your head out of the window
And see what your true lover says

Some people say that courting's pleasure
Oh what pleasure do I see
The dearest girl in this world
Has gone and turned her back on me

Awake, awake...

You needn't to bother asking my papa
He's in his room taking his rest
And in his hand he holds a weapon
To kill the man that I love best

Awake, awake...

I have no one to follow to the bedroom
I have no one to sleep with me
I have a wife way up in heaven
And the lord knows she loves me

Awake, awake...
