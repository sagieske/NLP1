Song:

I don't even know about that redemption
'Cause I still hear someone whispering
Trying to tell me something bout you
Don't know how to tell him I'm through

Gave you my sanity, you give me a chance to leave
You're telling me I don't need you, I don't believe you
'Cause I don't need nobody like you

Don't go, don't go, don't want you, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't go too far, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't go, I hate you

I turn my head up to the sky
I smoke my reefa, getting high
You know without you I'ma die
You clip my wings now I can't fly

My mama told me never cry
She never told me to say bye
I cannot let you go I tried
I hate you, girl, you know I lie
I hate you, girl, you know I lie

Boy, you're gonna have to use your senses
Just to figure out the distance, difference
How you wanna love me, you choose
Except of why I'm looking confused

I gave you my sanity, I gave you a chance to leave
Telling me I don't need you I don't believe you
'Cause I don't need nobody like you

Don't go, don't go, don't want you, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't want you, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't go too far, I hate you
Don't go, don't go, don't go, I hate you

You's a muthafuckin' b***h to me
You just left me bleed, you just left me leave
Now I cannot see
'Cause when I cry, I cry, tears of blood

You the one I love
You the one I love
You the one I trust
And you said you can't f**k with me

I can't f**k with you
We can't f**k with we and we cannot see
I hate you, girl you know I lie
I hate you, girl you know I lie

Baby, I can't stand you, baby 'cause I'm gone
I'd rather hate you than see you at the door
Baby, ain't no love left in you, no
If that's what I'm telling you I hate loving you

I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you, no
Why not tell the truth? I hate loving you
I don't wanna, don't wanna be without you
I let you control my heart, baby, you go too far
Don't go, don't go, don't go, I hate you
