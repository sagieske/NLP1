Song:

Autumn the wind blows colder than summer
Autumn my loves gone with another
I can' t demand anything of myself now
So, I guess I' ll stay here in New England for Autumn, Autumn

The buildings look tall and gray
The birds flying haven' t much to say
They all know that it' s coming again
So I guess they' ll stay here in New England for Autumn, Autumn

Did you ever lose something that you thought you knew
Did you ever lose someone who was close to you
Well, I lost my lover, in my summer too

To Autumn wind blows colder than summer
Autumn my loves gone with another
I can' t demand anything of myself now
So, I guess I' ll stay here in New England for Autumn, Autumn
