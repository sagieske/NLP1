Song:

I got a sweet little angel and I love her so
She's there when I need her, she understands when I say go
In the night, when she says "Hold me", it makes me feel so strong
Living with her unfolds me, she gives me strength to carry on

I don't need anyone else
If I did I would be fooling myself
Anna, Anna

And I know if she left me, my world would turn cold
She's the best liitle lady that a man could ever hold
When I'm down, she knows what to say
She clears my blindness away
And in the night, she says "Hold me", it makes me feel so strong

I don't need nobody else
If I did I would be fooling myself
Anna, Anna

I found me a simple woman, yeah yeah
A simple woman
I have found me a simple woman, oooh yeah
A simple woman for a simple man
I found me a simple woman,
A simple woman, oh yeah yeah yeah
