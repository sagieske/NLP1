Song:

How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!

Carols being sung by the tree,

Window's candlelight shining bright for the whole world to see

Children's eyes of sweet expectations

Wondering what each present will hold

Lying in their beds and impatient

On long Christmas Eves of old

It used to be that all the family would gather for this one night

It used to be that special feeling shared together knowing Christmas was here one night a year

How I miss that Old Fashioned Christmas!

Memories that last through the years

Call me sentimental; Don't mind if you do

I send an Old Fashioned Christmas to you!
