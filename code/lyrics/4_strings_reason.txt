Song:

I think its time to talk with you
I think its time to realize
where is the love?

Are we gonna stay together
or is it time to say goodbyee
Where is the love?

Chorus:
give me a reason.. To hold on to what we've got
must be a reason... To hold on to what we've got

Time has come to set things right
is it worth another fight?
Tell me the truth

Is there something on your mind?
Tell me what you hind inside..
Tell me the truth

Chorus: (x2)

Are there things I should know?
Will you stay or will you go?..
Where is the love?..
Tell me is there hope inside?
Gotta read between the lines..
Where is the love?

Chorus:(x3)
