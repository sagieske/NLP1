Song:

Take a good look at yourself.
Your eyes always glaring always comparing
You can't stop your starring because there's always something wrong
Pull apart my heart, Scratch out my soul
Silence my dreams, When you see fit
This blood feud of chains and ice,
This blood feud has gone on too long
Cast your judgement somewhere else
Cast your judgement on yourself
Burn my idols but what about yours
