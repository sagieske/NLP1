Song:

I visualize the first time we're together
I close my eyes and for a moment all I see is you
Turn off the lights,
Don't look outside,
The world's gone crazy
But it's perfect here with you.

I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right now in this moment
I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right here standing next to you
I've never felt so alive.

I know what you're thinking,
You think that we're different
And my reputation, and the stories
Well at least you know it won't get boring
I know the one's who came before me,
Just let go as I crash into you.

I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right now in this moment
I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right here standing next to you
Heaven's heard me calling
The stars have all aligned
Your touch is so electric
And looking in your eyes
I've never felt so alive.

It's so surreal
The way you feel
How fast my heart is beating
And we're breathing together now
As we float out, above the clouds
I swear I'll never let you down.

I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right now in this moment
I've never felt so alive
Like I feel right here standing next to you
Heaven's heard me calling
The stars have all aligned
Your touch is so electric
And looking in your eyes
I've never felt so alive.

I've never felt so alive
I've never felt so alive
I've never felt so alive.
