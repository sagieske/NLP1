Song:

Hey, there's a look in your eyes
Must be love at first sight
You were just part of a dream
Nothing more so it seemed
But my love couldn't wait much longer
Just can't forget the picture of your smile
'Coz everytime I close my eyes
You come alive

The closer I get to touching you
The closer I get to loving you
Give it a time
Just a little more time
We'll be together
Every little smile
That special smile
The twinkle in your eye
In a little while
Give it a time
Just a little more time
So we can get closer
You and I

Then could I love you more
So much stronger than before
Why does it seem like a dream
So much more so it seems
I guess I found my inspiration
With just one smile, you take my breath away
So hold me close
And say you'll stay with me now

The closer I get to touching you
The closer I get to loving you
Give it a time
Just a little more time
We'll be together
Every little smile
That special smile
The twinkle in your eye
In a little while
Give it a time
Just a little more time
So we can get closer
You and I
