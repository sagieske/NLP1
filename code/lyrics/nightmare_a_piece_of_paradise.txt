Song:

Searching for a piece of paradise...

Day after day I hear the bell
A ray of light across the cell
Voices in the corridor
Keys are turning in the door
Hostile shadows darkness fall
And fade behind the walls
Invisible chains, my moves are in vain
I'm lost in my world of incredible pain

Searching for a piece of paradise
Oh I'm the one
Searching for a piece of paradise
I'm on my way
Searching for a piece of paradise
Please show me where to go!
Searching for a piece of paradise
Open the gates!

My trouble is too cold to share
Living a nightmare
"Paranoid disorder: therapy failed!"
The undertaker has my name
And I can hear the wolves howling in the rain
