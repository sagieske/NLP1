Song:

Swear to God I won't tell
Swear to God I won't tell
For my click imma ride or die
For my click imma ride or die [repeat]

Eatin on some chips
Plus I'm smokin on a blunt
Chillin on da front porch
Gray court pulled up in the front

All I know is smoke weed, rob steal and sell dope
Roll dice, get money and gang bang with my folk
Dre cap and waka
Hands, guns, and choppas
Can't find you then we dumping on ya mama [repeat]

Never again will I let a f**k try me
45 on my hip, gone check em if they try me
Squiggly lines and ivy closed caskets you dump b******s
From eastside to riverdale fake wheels thunder bells

That's gone keep my pockets swell
Hell yeah I rob and steal
Gucci he gone post da bail
Hand on my d*ck like f**k jail

Swear to God I won't tell
Swear to God I won't tell
For my click I'm a ride or die
For my click I'm a ride or die

Eating on some chips
Plus I'm smoking on a blunt
Chilling on da front porch
Gray court pulled up in da front
Now I'm grabbin on my pistol
And I'm running with da blunt
They think a n***a scared
I ain't no muf***king chump

All I know is smoke weed, rob, steal and sell dope
Roll dice, get money, and gang band with my folk
Dre cap and waka
Hand, guns and choppas
Can't find you den we dumping on ya mama [repeat]
