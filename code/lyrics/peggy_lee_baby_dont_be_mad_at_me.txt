Song:

"Baby, don't be mad at me.
If I made you cry, I'm sorry.
Baby, don't be mad at me.
If I told a lie forgive me.
Baby, don't be mad at me.
I know that I was wrong,
But I've paid for my mistake.
Won't you string along?
Give a broken heart a break?
I love only you, believe me.
Baby please be glad at me
Baby, don't be mad at me.
I know that I was wrong,
But I've paid for my mistake.
Won't you string along?
Give a broken heart a break?
I love only you, believe me.
Baby, please be glad at me.
Baby, don't be mad at me.
Baby, don't be mad at me. "
