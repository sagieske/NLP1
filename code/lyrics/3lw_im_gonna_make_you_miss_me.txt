Song:

[Intro:]
Hey (yeah)
Ehh (what)
Hey, yeah yeah
C'mon (c'mon)
(Here we go)

Everyday I see you
With some girlfriend, yeah
You think I could care less
About it (care less about it)
I could keep it secret
Keep playing pretend, oh
But the way I feel you, I doubt it

No more waiting, hesitating
It's gauranteed

I'm gonna make you miss me
You're gonna wanna kiss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
All of the time

Boy you wanna get with me
You know you can't resist me
I'm gonna make you miss me
'Til you are mine

(Verse two, check it out)

You're about to find out
I get what I want
Once I've made up my mind
(Made up my mind, oh)
Gonna let you see me
Turning it on
That'll make you open your eyes
Your eyes

You'll be pulling
You'll be pulling
Passionately, 'cause

I'm gonna make you miss me
You're gonna wanna kiss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
All of the time

'Til you are mine
You've gotta know that something's up
I'll show you how I could love you
I'll turn it on (I'll turn it on)
Then I'll be gone (then I'll be gone)
But only 'til you come through
And feel the way that I do, oh

I'm gonna make you love me baby (yeah, yeah)
I wanna hear you call my name (say again, say again)
Not gonna stop until you say it (say it)
All of the... (time)

I'm gonna make you love me baby (what, what)
I wanna hear you call my name (Keelay)
Not gonna stop until you say it (uh)
All of the time

I'm gonna make you miss me
You're gonna wanna kiss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
All of the time

I'm gonna make you miss me
You're gonna wanna kiss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
All of the time
