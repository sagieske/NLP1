1-800-Suicide

Do you want to die?(x7)

It? S the beginning of the end
You want things to go faster
It? S the beginning of the end
Now everything? S too slow for you
It? S the beginning of the end
You are one step closer
It? S the beginning of the end
Say Amen

Is the beginning of the end
You know nothing last forever
A beginning of a trend
You need someone there to care for you
Is the beginning of the end
I don? T think you understand
Just a beginning of a flatline
Together

1-800-Suicide
Or maybe Doctor Online could help you die
You need wings for fly
You need someone
To take your place
When you are gone

Or maybe Doctor Online could help you die

You need someone

When you are gone
