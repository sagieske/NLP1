Song:

The dawn of time breaks
See the sun rise to the sky
The wheel of time begins to turn

But then we heard it
A divine voice out of nowhere
Spoke to our hearts and showed the way

Almighty lord we have come to your hall
Do glatem live, creator of all
Open your heart and you will find a way
Paradise calling and enter you may

Falling down
Now your soul returns to paradise
7734

The wheel kept turning, ages came
Time passed us by
We lived in perfect harmony
But then it happened
Our ranks decreased rapidly
But now it's time for our return

Once we were numerous
But that's long ago
We are no longer 7734
We last 2united and 2 became 1
111 perished in flames
