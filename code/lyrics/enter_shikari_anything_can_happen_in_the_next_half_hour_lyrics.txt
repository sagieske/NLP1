Song:

His eyes are locked on her,
Her eyes are fixed elsewhere,
He's confident, but he's not aware,
She doesn't care.
Their only connection, is the silence that they both grasp,
He's lost control, but she's not aware, of his stare.
Everything seems to intimidate him, with the strobe lights
Flashing, her body's jolting,
But cracking, as his eyes, spilt in two, if only she knew...
If only she knew,
If only,
If only she knew.

The curtain goes down, on him again?
The curtain goes down, on him again?
Everything seems to be closing in on her,
It feels just like she is being hunted,
But it's all right, it's all good,
Shes not aware, of his stare.

We've had this date from the beginning.
We've had this date from the beginning.
The curtain goes down, on him again?
The curtain goes down, on him again?
Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down...?
Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down...?
