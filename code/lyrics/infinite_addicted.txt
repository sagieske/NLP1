Send* corrections to the typist Yo

for, real Y'all

living in a dream world Rexdale

It's

a reality world right here for, real Yeah

[First

Verse] Yo

I'm stuck in this organized crime life Shook

slingers get robbed blind Soldier

ain't afraid to do time We

run the range like a militant co-thug Meanwhile

on the streets what, I kill is just throw slugs Supplying

the corner so, them dealers can sell drugs Now

you see my block get hot Rob

or shoot and get shot Police

wanna know our names yo that's, why we stay low I'm

caught up between my music and street life My

blood is like my heart dear God And

my gat is my wife This

world is spinning into sicker times thawing, like ice Hated

female probation officers they, boook us for spite I'm

living fouler ever, since Squiggs lost his life Hard

cold stone don't, give f k**you get blown Never

talk my s t**on phone ever since I came home You

puff your glass jaw I, puff my marley sit on the rail You

tell your untruth I, tell reality from Rexdale [Chorus

1] Material

world - got me addicted Drug

money corners - got me addicted Them

sawed down barrels - got me addicted Guarding

my heart - but still I'm addicted [Second

Verse] Yo

I got hit ever, since worse No

I never did snatch purse example, My

palm grips the pearl handle Too

many flaws in the way that, makes us disturbed Like

pulling out broad, daylight like I got some nerve The

only thing now this, music got my face baited This

leaves me more risk round snitches and hipocrites Place

under warrents they, want me on the cell block Trying

to give me fourteen years and keep me on lock Surround

my house front, and back in the night light wishing to book me Two

in the morning but they can't find me trying, to look me Ain't

nothing much to say after, the street already hook me I

guess I'm addicted like my mind has took me - took me We

be dealing with this physical some, lie regardless Sometimes

the bigger the grains who hit hardest I

never boast about it be, smart like the smartest I

wipe it off I, loaded it with leather gloves regardless Chorus

1 [Chorus

2 ]:My

Rexdale blocks - got me addicted All

them work nights - got me addicted Undeath

fast money - got me addicted Guarding

my heart - but still I'm addicted [Third

Verse] I'm

from the Rex-village dollar, signs who's quick to stick it Run

up in your house to be specific Ain't

nothing perfect or terrific so, lay down quick Special

delivery of open burn wound inflicted I

guess they like the way we dip it Gangster

walks the, way we talk And

the way we lie they down on they sidewalk Face

down on the rich block mask, up right to my eyelids Stick

and move quick on, the run like a fugitive Stay

communicated from back roads to pay phones I

never talk too long I, switch clothes No

time for normal wasting wash, vinegar inside your basement Chorus

1 &amp 2; [Outro
