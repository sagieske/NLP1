Song:

My baby taught me how to be
My baby taught me how to fight
My baby taught me how to die
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.
My baby taught me how to smoke
My baby taught me how to breathe
My baby taught me how to hide
My baby taught me how to leave
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.
My baby taught me how to choke
My baby taught me how to eat
My baby taught me how to f**k
My baby taught me how to be
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol, alcohol.
