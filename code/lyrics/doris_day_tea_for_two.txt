Song:

Oh, honey
Picture me upon your knee
With tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'll awake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take, for all the boys to see
(Oh, darling)

We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Can't you see how happy we will be?

Picture you upon my knee
Tea for two and two for tea
Me for you and you for me alone

Nobody near us to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear
That we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and I'm gonna wake
And start to bake a sugar cake
For you to take, for all the boys to see

We will raise a family
A boy for you and a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy we will be?
(How happy we will be?)
