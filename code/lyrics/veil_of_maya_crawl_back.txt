Song:

I will be known and I will scream it
I will be known today
Relayed into thoughts of tranquil society, as this is our last nights rest
If these are all the wounds that we suffer, then we are the lucky ones
If this is all the time we have then we must move forward
I can't be your only savior
This will break
Under the pressure of their eyes I can't feel guilt I can't feel s**t
Do I need to repeat myself?
You can't crawl back can't crawl towards the light
I am now numb
