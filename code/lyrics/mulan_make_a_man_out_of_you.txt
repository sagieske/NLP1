Song:

(Shang)
Let's get down to business
To defeat the Huns.
Did they send me daughters
When I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I've ever met,
But you can bet before were through,
Mister I'll make a man out of you.

Tranquil as a forest,
But on fire within.
Once you find your center,
You are sure to win.
You're a spineless pale pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue.
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

(Chan-Po)I'm never gonna catch my breath.

(Yow)Say goodbye to those who knew me.

(Ling)Why was I a fool in school for cutting gym?

(Mushu)This guy's got them scared to death!

(Mulan/Ping)Hope he doesn't see right through me.

(Chan-Po)Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

Time is racing toward us,
'Til the Huns arrive.
Heed my every order,
And you might survive.
You're unsuited for the rage of war,
So pack up, go home, you're through.
How could I make a man out of you?

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

(Be a man)
We must be swift as the coursing river,
(Be a man)
With all the force of a great typhoon,
(Be a man)
With all the strength of a raging fire,
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.
