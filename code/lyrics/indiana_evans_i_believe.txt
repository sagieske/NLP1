Song:

I thought that life was kind
Just a state of mind
Then I found you and the sun shone brightly
It's like when your alone
Just pick up the phone
I hear your voice and I don't feel so empty

Uh, oh, you can do anything
Uh, oh, oh

[Chorus:]
Cause I-ee-I-ee-I believe in all that I can be
And I-ee-I-ee-I feel like the air now I can breathe
And think about love, 'bout love,
And think about you

And so we're here again
I talk with you my friend
Tears and fears they fall around so gently
And like the final call
We give and take it all
And just one kiss and I don't feel so empty

Uh, oh, you can do anything
Uh, oh, oh

Cause I-ee-I-ee-I believe in all that I can be
And I-ee-I-ee-I feel like the air now I can breathe
And think about love, 'bout love,
And think about you, yeah you

So how does it feel
When my love is real
You can be sure you set my heart free
And now that you know
Our love can grow
It can be all we ever wanted

Uh, oh, you can do anything
Uh, oh, oh

Cause I-ee-I-ee-I believe in all that I can be
And I-ee-I-ee-I feel like the air now I can breathe
And think about love, 'bout love,
And think about you
