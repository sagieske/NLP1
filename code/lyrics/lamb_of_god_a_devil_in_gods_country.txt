Song:

Down south soldier
Third world soldier
My vengeance will be swift and terrible
Many will die.
I am the distance between two points
Forgotten. A Void.
I dig holes brother.
Well, I've got a bone to pick
And a nerve to pluck
A skin to get under
And a home to wreck.
I've got ends to meet
So I've got a job to do.
Acrimonious and sanctified
Call me what you will.
Stick to your guns
The difference is mine are loaded.
Taste the sting of your arrogance
Stuck in this screeching b***h called life
Drop the coins and send you to Charon.
I will have my vengeance
In this life or the next.
Well, I've got a sucker to punch
And a back to stab
A head to kick in
And a throat to toslit.
I've got a job to do
Harsh and unrepentant.
Step back before you're the next to get served
With some Southern hospitality.
