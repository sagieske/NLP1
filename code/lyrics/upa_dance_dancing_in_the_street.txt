Song:

Dancing In The Street
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the street
We're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City
All we need is music
Sweet, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
[Bridge:]
There'll be swinging, swaying
And records playing
We're dancing in the Street
[Chorus:]
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So c'mon
Every guy grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing
We're dancing in the street
This is an invitation
Across the nation
A chance for folks to meet
[Bridge:]
[Chorus:]
