Cool music
Well I'm standin' here, looking at you.
What do I see?
I'm lookin' straight through. It's so sad
When you're young, too be told.
But, you're havin' fun so un-plug the jukebox.
And do us all a favor.
Oooh, that musics lost it's taste, so try another flavor.
AntMusic..
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh )
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh )
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh )
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh..)
Ooooh, when i'm standin here, what do I see?
A big Nothing, threatening me.
It's so sad, when you're young to be told.
But you're havin' fun so un-plug the jukebox.
And do us all a favor.
Oooh, that music's lost it's taste, so try another flavor.
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh...)
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh...)
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh...)
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh oh...)
Don't tread on an ant, he's done nothin' to you.
There might come a day
When he's treadin' on you.
Don't tread on ant you'll end up black and blue.
Oh, cut off his head, legs come lookin' for you. So;
Un-plug the jukebox.
And do us all a favor.
Hey ooohh
That, music's lost it's taste, so try another flavor.
AntMusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh......)
Antmusic...
(oh, oh oh oh oh......)
AntMusic!
(oh, oh oh oh oh......)
AntMusic......
Oh, un-plug the jukebox
And do us all a favor.
The music's lost it's taste, so try another flavor...
AntMusic.
