Song:

Well, Friday night
Has finally come around
And me and my baby gonna
Head for a spot we found

We're gonna forget our cares
And dance on into the night

Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
We're gonna say that it's all right

For two bits and a dollar
They've got a swinging show or you
Whoa, yes, they do
And the band won't quit
Til everybody tell them to

And when they place that slow dance
You can hold your baby tight

Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
We're gonna say that it's all right

Hey, they've got lots of pretty
Dancing girls for the fellows
But, oh, you better watch out
In case your baby get jealous

Now some people might like to sit
And watch a picture show
But if that's what your plans are
Don't ask me to go

Cause I'll be where the good times
Last til the early morning light

Down at the club (down at the club)
Whoa, everything is out of sight
(Down at the club) down at the club
They're gonna say that it's all right

It's all right (it's all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
It's all right (it's all right)
Let me tell you, it's all right...
