Song:

What I'm looking for is all I need
'Cause what I've wanted most is
Some space between her heart and mine
Which sure ain't no small chore to find

What I get will lead to what I do
I just hope that's not later than it is soon
Or else all night I'll be up again alright
What I straight up need to score is a place to cry

This ain't over until once it's through
But once more's twice as much as I can use
Or care to try for my eyes to get dry
'Cause man the fix I need right now is a place to cry

I don't need a lot just some quiet spot
That won't stain from tears
Please, I'd rather not see us both get caught
With cleaning up that could take years

What starts hurting worst is not as strong as
The aches that happen next
Then before long it passes by but not until I want to die
'Cause what I'm strung out for is a place to cry

I don't need a lot just some quiet spot
That won't stain from tears
Please, I'd rather not see us both get caught
With cleaning up that could take years

What I'm looking for is all I need
'Cause what I've wanted most is
Some space between her heart and mine
Which sure ain't no small chore to find

Oh, what I'm Jonesin' for right now
Is a place to cry
Yeah, what I'm jonesin' for right now
Is a place to cry
