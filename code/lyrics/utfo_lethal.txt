F/ Anthrax

[ Doctor Ice ]
Lethal - meaning - equivalent to deadly
And if you came to battle, homeboy, I hope you're ready
Cause Doc will be the slayer, emd will be the preacher
Kangol will be the lord while Mix-Master tries to teach ya
Not to f**k with the crew because we take on all comers
Slayin the scums through the winters and the summers
When I perform I wear rings that are nuggets
And you can best believe I'm comin ruff and rugged
Don't get me upset cause I'll persist to doubt you
Beat you in your face cause I don't give a damn about you
I'll make you lose control of your physical anatomy
Smile in my face until I'm gone, then be mad at me
At the Apollo Doctor Ice was cold hearted
I kill all the amateurs before they get started
Whenever I battle it be thunderin and stormin
So don't get nervous, that's just Doc performin

[ chorus ]
Kill the beat!
Kill the beat!
(Kill the beat!)
Kill the beat!
So suckers don't play us close cause we're lethal

[ all + (Joey Belladonna of Anthrax) ]
Pull out the tools, kill all the fools
And all those suckers sellin drugs in schools
(The White House is unaware) Anthrax!
(Watch the?????) drop the axe
On all the political people
Killin the poor (like a junkie with a needle)
We was born to be rulin, teachin and schoolin
All that's??????? While on the stage coolin
Devoted to demolish, slay anyone
And so it was written and so it shall be done
Man, if you think I'm bluffin (you ain't seen nothin)
a** and caps is all we're bustin

[ chorus ]

(Lethal)

[ all + (Joey Belladonna of Anthrax) ]
We only wanna beat you down with sound
(If the girl wanna get it on
Tell the girl) get on the ground
(Rock it to the left, cause I'm not deaf)
(That's the way...) ah-ha ah-ha
The untouchables, puttin heads to bed
Cause (that's the way...) ah-ha ah-ha
[ Educated Rapper ]
Yo bust it, from state to state they call me the great
In England they call me the educated mate
Cause I'm known to be quiet, at parties we riot
Sometimes I get beside myself, I can't deny it
The rhythm of the beat has emd on the attack
I'm bad - I'm better - I'm back
(Danny)

(Lethal)

[ Kangol Kid + (Joey Belladonna of Anthrax) ]
I'm lethal, and my venom can kill
There ain't a graveyard I can't fill
With bodies I've tortured, ripped in two
(Why) cause I had nothin better to do
If you ask me again, you'll regret it
My name is Kangol, don't forget it
This message is for the illiterate people
What are we, Anthrax? (We're lethal!
Solid like rock, above yo level
Lethal like a bomb, heavy like metal
Mix-Master, do you agree?)
(*Dj scratches "yeah"*)
(Well come on, scratch one for me)
(*Dj scratches*)

[ Joey Belladonna of Anthrax ]
(Full Force, get busy one time)
