Song:

Father can you hear me
We need your love today
I know that you are listening
You hear men everyday
Father please hear us
And we will be ok
Father we need you to heal families today

Father can you hear me
I'm calling on your name
Not budda nor muhammed
But it's jesus we cry out loud
Father just forgive us
Hear us when we say
We'll give ya, give ya, give you everything our lifes and souls today

Father you know we need it
I've never seen so much pain
We have the faith for now
Your victory we will gain
Father you know we mean it
There's no more heart of stone
Were ready for your power
Now the sin is gone
