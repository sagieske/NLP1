Song:

There's a picture that I carry, 
One we made some time ago
If they ask who's in the picture with me, 
I say just a girl, I used to know.

Just a girl, I used to go around with
Just a friend, from long ago, 
I don't tell them how lost I am without her
I say she's just a girl, I used to know.

I say, she's just another girl now
Just a flame, that's lost it's glow
And I say, her name has slipped my mind now, 
And she's just a girl, I used to know.

Just a girl, I used to spend some time with
Just a friend, from long ago, 
I don't talk about the nights I cry about her
I say she's just a girl, I used to know.

Just a girl I used to know...
