Song:

(Spoken Introduction)
I don't remember feelin like this...
Baby... Baby, I love you... Baby... Baby, I love you

[Verse:]
I got this Jones formin in my bones (from a man),
Who indeed took over my soul, (understand),
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
Get on my knees, till they bloody red (baby please).
See, I don't know if you get it yet, (just don't know).
He's like the lighter to my cigarette (watch me smoke).
I never knew another human life (didn't know),
Can have the power to take over mine, so baby, baby

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, (baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,.
I love it when I hear yah name, got me sayin,
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, (baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,.

[Verse 2:]
See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I'll give up everything I own for you (wont think twice).
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I lose my thought lookin in your eyes (I know why),
Because your kisses make my lips quiver (ooh-ooh-oooh-and that's real),
And when you touch me my whole body shivers. (oooh-oooh-oooh-I can feel).
Now, I can see how another life (another life),
Can have the power to take over mine,

[Bridge:]
Cause you're my

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, (baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,.
I love it when I hear yah name, got me sayin,
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, (baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,.

[Verse 3: Ad-libs)
Break it down.
Baby, I can't see my worth (I can't see),
Living here on Gods green earth (Gods).
You don't know what youve done to me (done to me).
I never thought I'd need you desperately (desperately).
It's kind of sick how I'm stuck on you (stuck on you),
But I don't care cause I'm needin you (I'm needin you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
Cause you're my baby (cause your my baby).

[Verse 4:]
Listen, and when the world starts to stress me out (where I run),
It's to you boy without a doubt (youre the one),
Who keeps me sane and I can't complain (can't complain),
You're like a drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange).
You're like the blood flowin through my veins (ooh-ooh-ooooh),
Keeps me alive and feedin my brain (oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooh).
Now this is how another human life (another life),
Could have the power to take over mine,

[Bridge:]
Cause you're my

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
I love it when I hear yah name, got me sayin,
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby(ooh-ooh-aah-ooh-ohh),
(baby, I love you).
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

[Outro:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.
