Song:

Underground I'm waiting
Just below the crowded avenue
Watchin' red lights fading out of view

Oh the air feels heavy
Everything just passes by
And I think that I'm a little shy

Meet me outside above ground
I see you on your way
I'll be with you someday, someday

Drawing lines above my head
But the fan keeps spinning over me
Just my thoughts to keep me company

Now I know I'm ready
Pour the night into a glass
Can I sip it slow and make it last?

Meet me outside above ground
I see you on your way
I'll be with you someday, someday

Meet me outside above ground
I see you on your way
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
