Song:

I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,
I'm holding on,
I'm still awaiting you,
You cling to me but I remain composed,
I'll take the blame, grow you a thornless rose
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,
I'm holding on,
I'm still awaiting you,
Awaiting you,
Awaiting you
I swallow deep but the distance grows,
I'm struggling on to find the endless road
You cling to me, but I remain composed,
The moon is full, but the darkness knows
I swim the lake for I have lost my shoes,
I'm holding on,
I'm still awaiting you,
Awaiting you,
