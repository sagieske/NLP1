Song:

When the world gets too heavy
Put it on my back, 
I'll be your levy.
You are taking me apart
Like bad glue on a get well card.

It was always you
Falling for me.
Now there's always time.
Calling for me.
I'm the light 
Blinking at the end of the road.
Blink back to let me know.

I'm a fly that's trapped
In a web
But I'm thinking that
My spider's dead.
Lonely, lonely little life.
I could kid myself 
By thinking that I'm fine.

It was always you
Falling for me.
Now there's always time.
Calling for me.
I'm the light 
Blinking at the end of the road.
Blink back to let me know.

That I'm skin and bone.
Just a cane and rusty throne.
All the castle's under siege.
But the sign outside says leave me alone.

It was always you
Falling for me.
Now there's always time.
Calling for me.
I'm the light 
Blinking at the end of the road.
Blink back to let me know. 
(It was always you)
Blink back to let me know.
(It was always you)
