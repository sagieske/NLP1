Song:

Hmm (Dna)
Yeah, yeah, hmmm,

We are friends for life
Hold that deep inside
Let this be you're drive
To survive

And you stand high and tall
Make sure you give you're all
And if you have a fall
Know that I'm right here

We'll always be together
Don't you worry
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry

The circle will never end
Just know that we'll meet again
And we'll always be together forever always
Oh oh, I am here

Find me in the sky
Dancing with the moon at night
You're heartbeat is disguised as mine
Lullaby

Be happy and know that I'll
Watching you travel far and wide
Waiting for us to meet again

We'll always be together
Don't you worry
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry

The circle will never end
Just know that we'll meet again
And we'll always be together forever always
Oh oh, I am here

If you need me yeah
I'm in the wind look for me friend
I'm in the stars
When you need me the heaven will send a message within
Straight to your heart

Oh oh oh

We'll always be together
Don't you worry
I'll always be by your side
Don't you worry

The circle will never end
Just know that we'll meet again
And we'll always be together forever always
Oh oh, I am here

I am here
Yeah
I am here
I am here
