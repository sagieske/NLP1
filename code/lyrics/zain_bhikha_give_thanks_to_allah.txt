Song:

Give thanks to Allah,
For the moon and the stars
Praise Him all day
For what is and what was.
Take hold of your Eeman
Don't give in to Shaitan
O you who believe please give thanks to Allah.
Allahu Ghafur, Allahu Rahim, Allahu yuhibo el Mohsinin,
Hua Khalikuna, Hua Razikuna, wa hua ala qulli shayyin Qadir.

Allah is Ghafur, Allah is Rahim, Allah is the One Who loves the Mohsinin,
He is the Creater, He is the Sustainer and He is the One Who has power over all.

Give thanks to Allah,
For the moon and the stars
Praise Him all day
For what is and what was.
Take hold of your Eeman
Don't give in to Shaitan
O you who believe please give thanks to Allah.
Allahu Ghafur, Allahu Rahim, Allahu yuhibo el Mohsinin,
Hua Khalikuna, Hua Razikuna, wa hua ala qulli shayyin Qadir.

Allah is Ghafur, Allah is Rahim, Allah is the One Who loves the Mohsinin,
He is the Creater, He is the Sustainer and He is the One Who has power over all.
