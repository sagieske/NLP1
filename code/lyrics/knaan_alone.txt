Song:

Slum dog millionaire
The underdog sign when nobody can
Big shows, sick flows
I'm on the roll, that's just how it goes.
I think big, I act high
I chop it up in the streets like crack rock.

Got lots of money
But I don't got everything.
Got lots of honeys
But ain't got me a Queen! 
Feel like a champ
But I don't got me a ring.
Not me, not me yup.
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around around).
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around around).

The fast life, the fast cars
I spend my time with 'em honeys at the bar.
Bank roll, credit cards, 
Up in the club they think they know
Just who I ARE.
A big deal, a big star
Ridding big WHEELS
Ahaaa! 

Got lots of money
But ain't got everything.
Got lots of honeys
But ain't got me a Queen! 
Buy lots of diamonds, 
But I don't got me a ring.
Not me, not me yup.
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around)
(Not maybe just yourself), yup
(I'm looking in your face)
(The life from the party)
(And everything will stay stay), yup.

Got lots of money
But I don't got everything.
Got lots of money
But I don't got everything.
Not me, not me yup.
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around).
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around).
(Not maybe just yourself), yup
(I'm looking in your face)
('Cause I'm the life from the party)
(And everything will stay stay), yup.
