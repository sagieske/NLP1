Song:

Intro:
Dreams are made for children
Reasons you and I can see
The answers are a-plenty
They happen to you and me.

(Repeat Intro)

Chorus:
Dreams are made for children
Well, now you do not see
The answers you no longer find
What has happened to you, to you and me?

Stanza 1:
Have the years passed?
Has our love not soared?
When have you dreamt last?
Oh, now you're bored.

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

Stanza 2:
Now at the wall we stare
Back against the door
Looking for that dream so rare
From what sky did we fall?

(Repeat Chorus)

Coda:
Dream, dream away
Dream, dream, dream away
Dream, dream, dream away
Dream, dream, dream away.

(Repeat Chorus)

(Repeat Coda 2x)
