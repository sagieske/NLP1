Song:

Naked and frozen at the side of a lake,
I think I've gone and made my big mistake,
I took her swimming, we had a fight,
Now my clothes and the lady are well out of sight;

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

Naked and frozen at the side of a lake,
If she was here I wouldn't hesitate,
To tell her how, the way things are,
With a long conversation in the back of a car;

And it looks like I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,
Just me and my beating heart, singing in the dark;

I think she owes me an explanation,
She's got the whip hand in this situation,
If I try to tell her just the way I feel,
It could start the whole thing all over again;

Ooh, I think I'm heading for a night on the river,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be I'm heading for a night on the river,
But I see the lights of a car, shining in the dark,

Ooh, could be we're heading for a mm-mm,
Under the moon and the stars,
Could be we're heading for a mm-mm,
Just you and me and our beating hearts,
We're singing in the dark...
