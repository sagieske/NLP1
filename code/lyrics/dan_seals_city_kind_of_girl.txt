Song:

I'm just a country boy
I'm used to starry nights
She's metropolitan
She's used to neon lights
She loves the Gucci scene
I love my own blue jeans

Everybody says she's not my kind
She's a city kind of girl
Says she's only playing with my mind
She's a city kind of girl

I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild

Maybe I'm a crazy boy
But I know when the feeling's right
I got her going fishing now
She's got me climbing higher and higher
She loves to bait my hooks
I love to read her books

Everybody says she's not my kind
She's a city kind of girl
Says she's only playing with my mind
She's a city kind of girl

I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild

I love the way she walks
She loves the way I talk
I love the fancy style
She loves how I drive her wild
