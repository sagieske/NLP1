Song:

Back to the streets where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Well, now we're feeling so good

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can
Now we're feeling so good

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a place, where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's night in the afternoon
Now we're feeling so good
Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Can you feel it too?
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street
Down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do ya know what I mean?

Back to the place, hey
Where we used to stay
Man it feels good to feel this way
Now I know what I mean

Back to the street, back to the place,
Back to the room where it all began
Back to the street, back to the place,
Back to the room where it all began
Where it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When's it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can so you do
We're feeling so good
Just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
