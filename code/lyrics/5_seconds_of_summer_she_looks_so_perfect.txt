Song:

Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Heyy!
Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Heyy!

Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
That I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrowed heart
And I know now
That I'm so down
Hey! Hey!

Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Heyy!

Let's get out, let's get out
Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
Cause I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
That I'm so down
I made a mixtape stream out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now
That I'm so down
Hey! Hey!

Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Heyy!

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
That I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrowed heart
And I know now
That I'm so down
Hey!

Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Hey-ey! Heyy!

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now
That I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrowed heart
And I know now
That I'm so down
Hey! Hey!
