Song:

I'm a little pawn still in your game
And you ignore my advances
I turn my head and I look away
But I can't control my eyes are on you

Oh, you're on the run and I'm chasing you
Feels like war with all your glances
I'm just a boy without a clue
And I can't control following you

But it's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me

I know you better than you know
You can fight but it's not over
I say to stop but you start to go
I guess that means it's L-O-V-E

I say to look but you turn away
I say we put our best foot forward
Will you believe, come next to me
Oh, why can't you see, I'm begging you, please

But it's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me

And I'm knocking on your door
Baby baby, please now
Falling on your floor
Baby baby, please
I keep knocking on your door
Baby, baby, please now
Falling on your floor
Baby baby, please

But it's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
It's alright, alright with me
