Song:

She only smiles
He only tells her
That she's the flowers, the wind and spring
In all her splendor sweetly surrendering
The love that innocence brings

**
Almaz, pure and simple
Born in a world where love survives
Now men will want her
'Cause life don't haunt her
Almaz, You lucky lucky thing

Now I watch closely
And I watch wholly
I can't imagine love so rare
She's young and tender
But will life bend her
I look around is she everywhere

** Repeat

He throws her kisses
She shares his wishes
I'm sure he's keen without a doubt
With love so captive
So solely captive
I ask if I could play the part

** Repeat

Almaz, You lucky lucky thing
Almaz, You lucky lucky thing
