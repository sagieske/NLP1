Song:

Hold it in your arms, be still, pull there
I’ll hold you in mine before we run
We can start to sing, I know it’s odd
Beliving in all of this, and then we run
Running away from the end
Running away from the end
Running away to say

Orange clouds in full, the sky falls back
Before we lose our mind
Before we escawe, ... Line
To fast, and wise
Slowly like the storm
And still we’re there
Running away from there
Running away from there
Running until we’re there

Take me to a place where I’ll need this
Take me on the honest trial
Speak to me words we can’t erase
Take me there, it’s only us
