Song:

Well I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry
Yes I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's something that money can't buy

Well a poor boy's chances for pretty girl's glances are sometimes very few
Though I've got no money if you'll be my honey here's what I'll offer you
Well I'll give you love...
[ steel ]
We met by chance and I knew at a glance that I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you if you will agree
And I'll give you love...
