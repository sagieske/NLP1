Song:

How can I run away from darkness at the close of day
When all I think about is you?
Not knowing where I'm going, what am I to do
When all I think about is you?

I'll stand an hour knocking
Knowing that my heart is mockin' me
She doesn't live here anymore

I don't know why I bother, what else can I do
When all I think about is you?
Dream maker, heart breaker, how can dreams come true
When all I dream about is you?

I'll stand an hour knocking
Knowing that my heart is mockin' me
She doesn't live here anymore, oh

How can I run away from darkness at the close of day
When all I think about is you?
Not knowing where I'm going, what am I to do
When all I think about is you?

I don't know why I bother, what else can I do
When all I think about is you?
