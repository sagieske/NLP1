Song:

When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you

When the load gets to heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere
There's no one there
And I'm feeling like a fool

Chorus
That's when I think of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm caught in the crossfire
Of wrongs making right
When I wake in the night
That's when I think of you

When I'm halfway to heaven
With three parts of hell
And its all just as well
That I can't even tell
And I'm lost without a clue

Chorus

If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

When I'm a long way from loving
So far from home
When it feels like I'm in the twilight zone
And I just can't make it thru

Chorus

If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you

I'm always thinking of you
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad not being with you
If not for the thought of
Promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad not being with you
