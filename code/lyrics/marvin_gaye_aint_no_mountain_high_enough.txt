Song:

Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

'Cause baby,
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Remember the day
I set you free
I told you
You could always count on me darlin'
From that day on I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way,some how

'Cause baby,
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Oh no darlin'
No wind, no rain

All winters cold
Can't stop me baby (No No Baby)
'Cause you are my goal
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me oh baby.

My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you babe

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
