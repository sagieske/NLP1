Song:

A hundred times I have walked out the door
Just to walk back a hundred times more
A thousand nights I have sworn not to stay, ooh oh
I remained tangles in the chains of desire, ooh
I know that it's no good
I shouldn't be here
I know I should leave you

Chorus
Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
No I shouldn't be so weak
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes I know
That a heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong

A hundred ways you have captured my soul
I can't hold on but I can't let go
Your spell on me is a spell I can't break, ooh oh
All my strength burning in the flames of desire, ooh
I don't wanna stay here
I don't wanna leave you
Don't know how to leave you

Chorus
Wo, so strong, oh
I can't let go oh no
Wo, so strong, wo, so strong
'Cause you're a part of my soul
And I, can't escape you
No matter how hard I try
I can never be free
Of your hold on me
I can't let go

A hundred times I have walked out the door
Just to walk back a hundred times more

Chorus
Shouldn't let you close to me
Shouldn't have this hold on me
But a heart can only be so strong
Every time I try to go
Just one look in your eyes I know
That a heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong
A heart can only be so strong
