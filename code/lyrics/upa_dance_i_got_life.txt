Canta: Pedro

I got life, mother
I got laughs, sister
I got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too
Like you

I got my hair, I got my head, I got my brains,
I got my ears, I got my eyes, I got my nose, I got my mouth,
I got my teeth, I got my tongue, I got my chin, I got my neck, I got my t***, I got my heart, I got my soul, I got my back
I got my arms, I got my hands, I got my fingers, got my legs, I got my feet, I got my toes, I got my liver, got my blood

[Chorus:]
I got life, mother
I got laughs, sister
I got freedom, brother
I got good times, good time man
I got crazy ways, daughter
I got million-dollar charm, cousin
I got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too
Like you...

I got my hair, got my head, got my brains, got my ears, got my eyes, got my nose, my mouth.
I got my teeth
I got my tongue, got my chin, got my neck, got my t***, got my heart, got my soul, my back

I got my arms, I got my hands, I got my fingers, Got my legs, I got my feet, I got my toes, I got liver.
Got my blood

[Chorus:]

I got my arms, I got my hands, I got my fingers, Got my legs, I got my feet, I got my toes, I got my liver.
Got my blood

Got my guts
Got my muscles
I got life, life, life, life
Life!
