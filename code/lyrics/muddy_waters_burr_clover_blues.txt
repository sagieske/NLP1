Song:

Well, now the reason that I love
That ol' Stovall's farm so well.
Yes, now the reason that I love
That ol' Stovall's farm so well.
Well, you know we have plenty money
And we never be raisin' hell.
Well, we raise plenty cotton
And we are booked out with the corn.
Yes, we raise plenty cotton
And we are booked out with the corn.
Well, you know, we have to carry the place on
Now the main boss been here and gone
