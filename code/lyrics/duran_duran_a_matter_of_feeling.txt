Song:

How does it feel
When everyone surrounds you?
How do you deal?
Do crowds just make you feel lonely?
What do you say
When people come and try to pin you down?
Acquaintances smile,
But that's no understanding.
How, after a while
You keep falling off the same mountain.
Try to explain it,
But nothing really gets them that high.

CHORUS
Steal away in the morning;
Love's already history to you.
It's a habit you're forming.
This body's desperate for something new.
Just A Matter of Feeling
These moments of madness are sure to pass,
And tears will dry as you're leaving.
Who knows, you might find something to last.

Emotion's a game,
Saved up for a rainy Monday.
But you laugh just the same,
'cause it's been pouring on Sunday.
Call up your numbers,
And never let the zeros bring you down.
How does it feel?
Is time too heavy to hold?
Whatever you decide for the moment is holy.
Whenever you slow down to see life is passing by.

CHORUS

You can...CHORUS

A matter of feeling. A matter of feeling.
A matter of feeling. A matter of feeling.
