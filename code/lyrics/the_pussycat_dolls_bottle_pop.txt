Song:

(Feat. Snoop Dogg)

Tip top, drip drop, bottles pop,
Lips lock, hips rock, don't stop,
Big Snoop Dogg is back on the block
P. C. Disney shake that thing to this beat
Taste like brandy
Shape like landy
Sweet like candy candy candy

All them other models bottling
Like mama's bottle tasty
If you put my bottle
All the models gonna hate me

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me

Every girl dreams of herself in pearls
Wanna be the fast driver of a shiny car
But the good girls suddenly the bad girls
Just because they wanna be a movie star

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me

Every girl feels this world belongs to her
No matter who make her purr she's a super star
Now the worry is us
My girl with curves
That'll make you smell the burn when her bottle pops

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me

Pass the fifth I pass it back
Turn around lil mama got a** in the back
See it's a fact a bottle of pop
If you shake it, then drop it like it's hot
Time is money and money is time
And if you with me all your money is mine
Yup yup, do it to deaf
Is it true that you get wet wet wet?

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me

Your turn me on
Your shake me up
So don't cha wanna take me
Just because
I'm the chosen one
Oh them models gonna hate me

All them other models bottling
Like mama's bottle tasty
If you put my bottle
All the models gonna hate me

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me

When my bottle pop
Shake Me

When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
When my bottle pop
Shake me
