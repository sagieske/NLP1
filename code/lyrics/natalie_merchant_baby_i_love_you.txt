[ Ronnie Shannon ]

If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid, just ask me
And you know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh I do declare (I do), wanna see ya willing
Stretch out your arms and boy you're gonna get it

'Cause I love you
Baby baby baby I love you
Now ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
Baby baby baby I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

If you feel you wanna kiss me
Go right ahead, I don't mind
All you got to do is snap your fingers
And I'll come runnin', I ain't lyin'
O what'cha want little boy, ya know ya got it
I'll deny myself before I see you without it

'Cause I love you
Baby baby baby I love you
Now ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
Baby baby baby I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

Some day you might wanna run away?
Leave me standin' here and cryin'
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from sayin' goodbye
Baby I love you (baby, baby)
Baby I need ya (baby, baby)
Baby I want ya (baby, baby)
Baby I love you (baby, baby)
Don't let your neighbors tell you that I don't love you
Don't let your low down friends tell you I don't need you
