Song:

Danny: Yo, Jordan! What's up?
Jordan: Hey Danny! What's happening?
Oh, here comes little Joey Joe down the street
Joe: Ho! What's happenin' fellas?
Jordan: Yo, there's Jon, but has anyone seen Donnie?
Danny: I don't know, but I thought I saw him walking towards the corner store.
Joe: Nah, he's at the park playing ball
Jon: Oh, here he comes now
(ad libbed greetings)
Donnie: Hey Guys!
Danny: Where have you been?
Donnie: Man, I've got a story to tell!
All: hit it!

Donnie:
Saw a homegirl at the corner store
Eyes started bugging, mouth fell to the floor
She had a miniskirt and a s*** pose
I tried to rap to her, but I just froze
Tell me now fellas, what can I do?
To make a girl like me, like a girl likes you?

Danny: Well Homeboy get ready!
Joe: 'Cause you want correcting
Jordan: 'Cause a girl needs love
All: And plenty of affection

Jon: If a girl were mine, I'd give her the world
I'd buy her diamonds and pearls just to make her my girl

Jordan: That might work with your girl, but not with mine.
She's not the type of girl to fall for any line

Joe: I'd take her out to dinner, treat her like a winner
I may be young, but I'm no beginner

Danny: All your ways are good, but not as good as mine
You have to be sincere for a girl that fine!

Chorus
Baby, won't you please be mine?
Are you down?
Baby, won't you please be mine?
Are you down? Ho!

Danny: Alright then, D., since you gave it a try
All: Tell us about the girl who caught your eye

Donnie:
It was after school and I was feeling cool
'Til I saw that girl and I started to drool
So I thought to myself, take it easily
I couldn't let peer pressure get the best of me
I thought to myself, what should I do?
That's when she came up on me and said 'i love you'

Donnie: Who me?
All: Yeah, you!
Donnie: Couldn't be!
All: But it's true!

Donnie: So I rushed back home to tell you guys,
But not before I got a quick kiss goodbye!

All: Did you meet her friends?
Donnie: Yeah, they looked def.
All: Yo, that was fresh!
Donnie: Word! Let's go left.
Jordan: So here goes the keys
Joe: On which it depends
Jordan: She's got
Joe: One!
Jordan: Two!
Danny: Three!
Jon: Four!
All: Fresh girlfriends!

Chorus

Are you down?
Are you down?
(repeat 5x)

Chorus

Are you down?
Are you down?
(repeat)

All: Joey Joe!
Joe: Nimble and quick.
You have to be def to be down with my clique

All: Jon!
Jon: You know I've got the style
When I go into a party all the girls go wild

All: Danny D!
Danny: The prince! Make no mistake.
I'm the mc devistating. So cool and I break.(dance)

All: Don-nie! Donnie: That's me, don't give me no slack!
I get loose with the juice, 'cause I got it like that
