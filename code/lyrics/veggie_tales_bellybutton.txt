Song:

Mr. Lunt: Baby I know your eyes see right through my disguise
Boyz: (Larry, Jimmy, Junior): And no one can deny
Mr. Lunt: Baby that I'm the one whose love is no surprise
Boyz: And he can't tell you no lie
Mr. Lunt: But there's a secret I've been hidin I can't keep it no more
Boyz: there's this thing about himself he's never told you before
Lunt: Baby!
Chorus:
Boyz: He needs to tell you something
Mr. Lunt: I don't got a bellybutton
Oh I need to tell you something
Boyz: Have you figure it out
He don't got a bellybutton
Boyz: Bellybutton no, oh no no
Mr. Lunt: Baby please don't squeal, just tell me how you feel
Boyz: Cause his love is for real
Mr. Lunt: And if you went away, my heart would never heal
Boyz: So to you he appeals
Mr. Lunt: there's something missing in my middle and it's hard to ignore
Boyz: there's this thing about himself he's never told you before
Lunt: Baby!
Chorus
Khalil: Bellybutton!
Boyz: Uh, uh
Khalil: Bellybutton!
Boyz: Uh, uh
Khalil: You say your bellybuttons missing, there's no reason for alarm
Its a common thing for gourds, it wont do you any harm
Youre technically a fruit and with that much being said;
Your umbilical equivocal is up there on your head!
You could opt for a prosthetic but of course you'd have to know
Itd be covered by your shirt, but not your hmo
Khalil: Bellybutton!
Boyz: Uh, uh
Khalil: Bellybutton
Boyz: Uh, uh
Mr. Lunt: a stylish something absent from my midriffs dcor
Boyz: there's this thing about himself he's never told you before
Lunt: Baby!
Boyz: He need to tell you something
Mr. Lunt: I don't got a belly button
Oh I need to tell you something
Boyz: Have you figure it out
He don't got a belly button
Boyz: Belly button no, oh no no
Lunt and Boyz: No belly button!
