Song:

You mean nothing but trouble baby, beat it
You mean nothing but trouble baby, beat it
If you think that you're still my friend
You are wrong, don't you understand
We can't go on like this, love was just a game now

You deceived me like a child so stupid
You deceived me like a child so stupid
I never believed you're a duchess
'Cause you cannot lie when you ought to
But I loved you so, everything was different

I despise you, I despise you

You tumbled all back down
I despise you, I despise you
The queen without a crown

I despise you, I despise you
You tumbled all back down
I despise you, I despise you
The queen without a crown

You mean nothing but trouble baby, beat it
You mean nothing but trouble baby, beat it
If you think that you're still my friend
You are wrong, don't you understand
We can't go on like this, love was just a game now
