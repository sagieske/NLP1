Song:

I've been driving around all night
Wondering what to do
The music on my radio
It only reminds me of you
I've been waiting all night long
I know you won't let me down
You know I can't stop
Till I've reached the top
I just wanna hear that sound

I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
Cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
Cause I need you so
And babe I can't let go

Satin sheets on my bed
It's empty as can be
I often think of you for a while
Yeah I want you close to me
I've been waiting all night long
I know you won't let me down
You know I can't stop
Till I've reached the top
I just wanna hear that sound

I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
Cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
Cause I need you so
And babe I can't let go

I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know you're mine
Cause I need you so
Babe I can't let go
I can't let go
Yeah babe
I wanna know your mine
Cause I need you so
And babe I can't let go
