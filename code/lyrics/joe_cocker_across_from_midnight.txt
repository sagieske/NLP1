Song:

It's come down to just the two of us
Me and my shadow on the wall
Radio playing softly
Somewhere down the hall

And over in the next room
The hollow sound of the cigarette come
I'm sitting across from midnight
And morning is a long way off

There's a fire in the trashcan
In the alley below
A thousand others gather 'round
Sipping wine and talking low

We're companions of the night time
We've got no place to go
Just sitting across from midnight
Time dragging by too slow

You can feel the night when you're all alone
There's comfort in the room
You keep hanging on
You wait until the dawn, oh yeah

The skeletons in the closet
March around like [Incomprehensible]
I guess it's too much too ask for
I need some breathing room

And the tall city buildings
They cover up the moon
I'm sitting across from midnight
Bored and you can't come too soon

The early morning hours
Bring out the darkness of your thoughts
When you sit across from midnight
Morning's a long way off, so faraway

Sitting across from midnight
It's dark
Sitting across from midnight
Me and the shadow on the wall

Sitting across from midnight
Morning is such a long way off
You know I'm sitting across from midnight
Sitting across from midnight
