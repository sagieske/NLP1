Song:

747 flyin' me back home
747, been lonely too long
I've been workin' on the road with a five-piece band
But don't you know I'm a little bit tired of all these one-night stands?

747, get me there tonight
There's a little bit of heaven, she loves me so fine
She'll be waiting at the gate for me when I land
There'll be a fire in her eyes, you know, for her lovin' man

747, please get there on time
747, hear your engine whine
Oh, and I'll hold her to me as long as I can
'Cause I love that girl and I'm gonna miss her 'til I'm home again
One more time

747 flyin' me back home
747, I been lonely too long
I've been workin' on the road with a five-piece band
Oh, but Lord, you know I'm a little bit tired of all these one-night stands
