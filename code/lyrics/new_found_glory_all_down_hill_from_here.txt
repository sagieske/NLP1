Song:

You're hiding something
'Cause it's burning through your eyes
I try to get it out
But all I hear from you are lies

And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were acting out your part
Once again we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?

Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness
Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss
(Let's go)

And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were acting out your part
Once again we're playing off emotions
Which one of us will burn until the end?

Catalyst you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

And I can't believe you pulled it off again
Or notice till it all sets in
You'll deny it till you're at your bitter end

And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were acting out your part
Once again we're playing off emotions
Which one of us will burn until the end

Catalyst you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

And you keep pulling me down, pulling me down, pulling me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here
