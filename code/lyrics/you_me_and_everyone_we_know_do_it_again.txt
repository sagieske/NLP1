Song:

Tonight will be presided by
A few drinks to calm me down
To settle my gut, to work up a smile
Because your bones are shaking
Baby, agitate my nerves
I'm feeling reckless and I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll do this till I'm somebody else

Tonight I'll be a classic work like
Edgar allen poe
And I'll die on these streets of baltimore
As a beggar, john, or buyer
Look I'm just trying to score!

But at least I wont be out alone I'm with my
Uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history is shouting
"HAVE ANOTHER"
Now I'm taking all the liberties I was
To scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now lay over and touch the floor

Plan A: has got a boyfriend but she melts to my touch
Plan B: has got a crush as much as she's got a lust
Plan C: well, god forgive me, but she just lives to f**k
I'll just act like I'm not in control

I'm feeling wreckless and I feel the need to stress this
I'm stepping out
And I'll take this drink this, do this, smoke this
F**k you while we're somebody else

But at least I wont be out alone I'm with my
Uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history is shouting
"HAVE ANOTHER"
Now I'm taking all the liberties I was
To scared to before
I've accepted that we're just chemicals
Now lay over and touch the floor

Shut up and dance, ms. Sings in her sleep
Ms. Moves to my beat, what kind of secrets are we keeping tonight?
Because he's not here and he's not waiting up
How about another spin around the floor?

But at least I wont be out alone I'm with my
Uncle and his mother
And the rest of my family's history is shouting
"HAVE ANOTHER"

Be sure I'm slutting it up
Cuz I know loves not enough
Now, I'll be outside the bar...
Hopes for the back of her car
She's got wander eyes,
But much more curious lips
And I'm still betting every dime
She answers as her skirt slides over her hips
