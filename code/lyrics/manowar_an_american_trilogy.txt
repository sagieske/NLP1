Song:

Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie

Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on

So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on
