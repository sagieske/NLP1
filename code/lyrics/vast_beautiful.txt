Song:

Stay with us my darling
Tomorrow is a brighter day
Stay with us my darling
There are so many things to love

You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to everyone
There are so many things to see
You are so beautiful to me

Heaven is a place I cannot see
When I'm beside you it's so close to me
These are the reasons you should stay
There is so much that you can give

You're a diamond I can't buy
You're a sin I can forgive
And when you sink into the dark
Know that I am there with you
