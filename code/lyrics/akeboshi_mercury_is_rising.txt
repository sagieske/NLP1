Song:

The sounds of horns
Break the still of the night
Folding up the map
Dear so near but hear in fear
Closer ever, closer ever

Blue sky lasts not long
Above your shoulder a fiery sunset
All the leaves lost their colors
Into the night, in that moment

When you sing sing sing
In a clockwise tone
Drum beat falls out
Rain drops rise up into the sky

When I dream dream dream
In a hidden place
I see a world upside down
Deep breath I take on the stump

When you sing sing sing
In a clockwise tone
Drum beat falls out, and rain... 
Rain drop rise up into the sky
