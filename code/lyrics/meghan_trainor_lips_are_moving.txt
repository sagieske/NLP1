Song:

If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

[Verse:]
Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

[Pre-Chorus:]
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

[Chorus:]
I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?

If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

[Verse 2:]
Hey baby don't you bring them tears
Cause it's too late, too late baby
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced babe

[Pre-Chorus:]
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

[Chorus:]
I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?

If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are movin, If your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, I said you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

[Chorus:]
I know you're lyin'
Cause your lips are movin'
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young, but I ain't stupid
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass, You gave me sweet talk
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie
Cause your lips are movin
Baby don't you know I'm done?
