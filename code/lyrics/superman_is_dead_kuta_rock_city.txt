Song:

Getting dressed and getting drunk, make some noise don't left behind
And the scars around your back
Never slip and never fall, we are young and we are free
So we sing it loud and clear
Like a rocket like a bomb, do we have to take it slow

BRIDGE:
And then here we are again
Tequila blast and Cadillac girls with the music swingin' (really) hard

CHORUS:
In Kuta Rock City, where the evil dance
Kuta Rock City, where the hero dies
Kuta Rock City, where's all my cash
Kuta Rock City, please don't break my heart again

It is late and getting hot, with the engine running fast
Story of suburban trash
Against every think you know, like a rebel with a gun
No time for society
Recognize and realize, move be just a little fast
