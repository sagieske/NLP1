Song:

Who are you?
Who do you think you are?
Your opinion means nothing
Your words are shallow and you'll get what you deserve
Get what you deserve

Isn't it funny
How life works in such
Mysterious ways,
Mysterious way?

All my life, I've been waiting for this moment
To live free and be me
All my life, I have always fallen short
But not this time, not this time
All my life, I've been waiting for answer
All my life

You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to
It's plain to see, I wanna be
A voice of hope and not the voice of a dying breed
And finally I'm doing what I wanna do
I've never felt so free in my whole life
There's nothing I would trade for
This is what I was made for

I won't be held back by failure (failure)

It's easy to lose yourself completely
To become your own worst enemy
Yeah, yeah

Don't try to tell me how to live my life
Don't try to justify what's wrong and what's right
Let's put it this way
I've been doing this for far too long
To give up everything I've worked for
I've made my deals and cut my losses

For you it's all about the money (money)
For you it's all about the fame
And how you play the game

You couldn't stop me even if you wanted to
It's plain to see, I wanna be
A voice of hope and not the voice of a dying breed
And finally I'm doing what I wanna do
I've never felt so free in my whole life
There's nothing I would trade for
This is what I was made for (made for)

Cause at the end of the day
We're all just trying to make a way
For ourselves, for ourselves

And I'm giving everything that I have left inside of me
Your words are meaningless
Cause I'm above the negativity

So take these words and hold them close
It's not about where you are right now
But where you wanna be that matters most
