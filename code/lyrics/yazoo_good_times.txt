Song:

Sometimes I feel I'll never belong
I want to get there so bad but it's taking so long
Sometimes I feel like letting go
But when it comes right down to it baby, who wants to know? (No-one)
And I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
Now I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)

Standing on the outside, I'm looking in trying to be heard, I don't know where to begin
Help me baby, show me how to be a part of it all and all c'mon, right here and now
Now I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
Now I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)

Hands are full of silver, my pockets full of gold
It's time I'm trying to spend and I can't get myself sold
I'm a bargain honey, I'm a giveaway
And you can have it all if you'd use up my day
Now I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
And I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
Now I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
And I find (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
(For a good time) Good times, good times, good times (For a good time), good times, good times (For a good time)
(For a good time) Good times, good times, good times (For a good time), good times, good times (For a good time)
Now I find (For a good time) (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
Now I find (For a good time) (For a good time) I'm knocking for a good time (For a good time)
(For a good time) Good times, (For a good time), good times, (For a good time)
(For a good time)
