Woke up this mornin' just about noon
Rolled back on over, it was way too soon
My sensibilities hadn't stirred you see
Might bother some, but it don't bother me
'Cause some people say ain't had enough fun
Some people say ain't had enough fun
I'll tell ya when I'm done
But until that time, ain't had enough fun
Right 'round the corner, right over the hill
Somebody's waitin' for some new thrill
They can wait there all of their life
Spinnin' them wheels 'til the time is right
As for me, I think I'll jump right into the fight
'Cause some people say ain't had enough gun
Some people say ain't had enough gun
I'll tell ya when I'm done
But until that time, ain't had enough fun
Why some people sure wound up tight
I'm here to tell ya Lord -- I got too many chills
To feel 'em all in one night
Now who says ya can't teach an old dog new tricks
Jus' fire off a few rounds at the poor boy's kicks
Ruler boy says don't worry
The monkey ain't dead so what's your hurry
The show ain't over so people please grab your seats
'Cause some people say ain't had enough gun
Some people say ain't had enough gun
My time ain't yet begun
So don't say I'm finished, no
I'll tell ya when I'm done
Until that time, I ain't had enough fun
