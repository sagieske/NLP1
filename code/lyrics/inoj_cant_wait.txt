Chorus
(can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on
Can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on)

Baby you know i like you but i just don't love you,
Don't want to leave you but i just can't please you
Since you don't want me,i kept you waiting
Gotta get it off on your own yeaa.


Chorus
(can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on
Can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on)



I gave you lovin', kissin and huggin,
But you say i'm buggin, when i want you i want your love.
I still can't please you, baby i gotta leave you,
Gotta get it off on my own.

Chorus
(can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on
Can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on)

Can't wait no more for you it's true,
Somehow i keep looking like a fool.
But i do wat gotta i do to prove,
That i can live without you 

Chorus
(can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on
Can't wait for you, no more i gotta move on)
