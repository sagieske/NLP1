Song:

Hush now, let's go quiet to the park where it first started
Cold night, us lying in the dark
I felt my heart was trying to find a place for you to stay
A place where I'd feel safe

Anything we have known
Anything we've forgotten
In the rain, in the dark we'll lay
In your arms, in your arms I'll stay

Take my hand, let's go into the trees
Behind the branches, falling on our knees
I remember feeling like this part of us would never change

Anything we have known
Anything we've forgotten
In the rain, in the dark we'll lay
In your arms, in your arms I'll stay

Follow me
We both know the way
It's always been the same

Anything we have known
Anything we've forgotten
In the rain, in the dark we'll lay
In your arms, in your arms I'll stay
