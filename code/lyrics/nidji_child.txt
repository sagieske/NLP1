Song:

I am one
I am child
I'm the saint who marches in love
I am the paint
Electric pain bolt of thunder in the rain

I'm the blood
I'm the key
You are evergreen who blessed in union
Let them born in to this world
Let them sing into the sky

I will be fading
As your child
As your child

Don't let go
Don't be frightened
Don't be scared and don't be late

I am one
I am child
I'm the saint who marches in love
