Song:

I remember the days
Of just keeping time
Of hanging around in sleepy towns, forever
Back roads empty for miles
Well you can't have a dream
And cut it to fit
But when I saw you, I knew
We go together, like a wink and a smile
Leave your old jallopy
By the railroad track
We'll get a hip, double dip, tip toppy, 2 seat pontiac
So you can rev her up
Don't go slow
It's only green lights and alright
Let's go together with a wink and a smile
(Instrumental)
Give me a wink and a smile
(Instrumental)
We go together like a wink and a smile
Now my heart is music
Such a simple song
Singing again, the notes never end
This is where I belong
Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes
Your so far away from yesterday
Together, with a wink and a smile
We go together, like a wink and a smile.
