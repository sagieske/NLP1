Song:

Verse 1: So blind was I not to realize that you needed me.
I'm here to try and give you everything cause you made me see.
Maybe for your love I would cry and maybe for your love I would die.
Just tell me what to do to prove to you. I'm serious, serious (yeah) ohh ohh ohh

Chorus: Cause baby time is not on my side. I've learned to love and with you I cry.
Give anything to be with you somehow.
Settle down maybe for your love.

Verse 2: I've lost you once yeah and I vow that I would never lose you again.
And I would never give up again.
Cause life without you is truly ain't worth living.

Repeat Chorus:

Bridge: Ohhhhhhhhhh, ohh wee babe, no I can't see nooo oh no no,
Maybe for your love I would die and maybe for your love
I would die just tell me what to do to prove to prove to you
I'm serious
