Song:

I wish I had your pair of wings
Had them last night in my dreams
I was chasing butterflies
Till the sunrise broke my eyes

Tonight the sky has glued my eyes
Cause what they seeґs an angel hive
Iґve got to touch that magic sky
And geet the angels in their hive

Refrain
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you

And all the sweet honey from above
Pour it all over me sweet love
And while youґre flying around my head
Your honey kisses keep me fed

I wish I had your pair of wings
Just like last night in my dreams
I was lost in paradise
Wish Iґd never opened my eyes

Refrain
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you

But thereґs danger in the air
Tryinґso hard to be unfair
Dangerґs in the air
Tryinґ so hard to give us a scare
But weґre not afraid

Refrain x 2

Oh I wish I were you
