Song:

The fog has finally cleared to see,
The beautiful life you've given me
To feel the breeze of my newborn's gentle breath
With one to walk hand in hand,
To share this life that you have planned
It's like a storybook with dreams
That are meant to see
Every next step is an extraordinary scene

I know that I've been
Given more than beyond measure,
I come alive when,
I see beyond my fears
I know that I've been
Given more than earthly treasure,
I come alive when
I've broken down and given you control

I've faced a great tragedy,
But have seen the works of what you bring
A display of faith that you give,
I don't know if I will ever understand
The depth of what it is you've done inside,
But I know I won't find any worth apart from you

I know that I've been
Given more than beyond measure,
I come alive when,
I see beyond my fears
I know that I've been
Given more than earthly treasure,
I come alive when
I've broken down and given you control

Everything that I have
Has been given so unselfishly
And shown that even when I don't deserve
You always show the fullness of your love

I know that I've been
Given more than beyond measure,
I come alive when,
I see beyond my fears
I know that I've been
Given more than earthly treasure,
I come alive when
I've broken down and given you control
When I've broken down and given you control
When I've broken down and given you control
