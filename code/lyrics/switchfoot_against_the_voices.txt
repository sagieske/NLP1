Song:

Start the day against the voices
The ones that tell me that I'm wrong
I hear them now
Screaming their delusions
Close my eyes and they're gone

If they ain't singing
And they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

'Cause everybody knows
The hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else

Start the road against the voices
I pick a path out in the woods
I've made mistakes
I've got the scars to prove them
I'd change the past if I could

If they ain't singing
And they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

'Cause everybody knows
The hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else

La la la la la la la la la la la

I close my eyes and then they're gone

If they ain't singing
And they're just talking
Let them keep talking to themselves

'Cause everybody knows
The hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself
Yeah, the fight to be yourself

If they ain't singing - yeah
If they ain't singing - ye-ah
Let them keep talking to themselves

'Cause everybody knows
The hardest war to fight
Is a fight to be yourself
When the voices try to turn you into someone else
