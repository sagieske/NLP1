Song:

Good pals, blood brothers
Me and three others
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four friends, none closer
Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team

Four guys our poundin'
The pavements of Agrabah
Poor guys with one Alabian dream

To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four bums, none better
Not one go-getter
Unmontivated in the extreme

Folks say, "Hey, go earn a living in Baghdad
Grow up, go earn the city's esteem! "
We say, "Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie! "
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four guys out making our music in Baghdad
In Baghdad we're the creme de la creme
Okay, supporters,
Clap hands, throw quarters,
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Good pals, real chummy
Whozat? Guess dummy!
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Old pals, none newer,
None tried, none truer
Eight eyes with one impertinent gleam

Four guys out passing the turban in Baghdad
For lettring off some musical stream
That's our finale

'Kay guys, let's blow this alley
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin and
Howzat so far, not bad'n it's
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim
