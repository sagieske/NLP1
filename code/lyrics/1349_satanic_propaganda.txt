Song:

Guided by the voice of silence,
I seek the chosen ones
To fullfill the wishes
Of the master beneath
Their souls are mine to keep
Sold for hopes and dreams
Signing with their own blood
I rule their destiny

I offer immortality

I offer power and-
Influence on whatever their simple
And primitive minds is able to come
Up with of
Stupid wishes and pathetic human
Materialistic requests

As Satan's army increases,
Endless lines of lost souls,
Is waiting to march out of hell

As the mighty demon hordes
Spread their wings
And rise to the sky
The seven gates of hell opens wide

Sell your soul
To an evil cause
