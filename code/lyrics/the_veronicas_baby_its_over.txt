Song:

Baby it's over
We can't recover
You can be sure that you aint my lover
Baby it's over
Now that you're out of my life
I'm gonna get on with my life

It's over baby
I don't need you tonight
Coz I don't wanna be with you
And no matter what you say
You're out of my life
Coz I don't give a damn 'bout what ya do
Why'd ya lie to me?
Why'd ya cheat on me?
I was blind to see
Don't wanna be the one you need
Baby we are through
I'm really over you
I'm over you

Baby it's over
We can't recover
You can be sure that you aint my lover
Baby it's over
Now that you're out of my life
I'm gonna get on with my life

Keep on telling me you'd do me right
And promise that you never do me wrong
It's like I said before
I can't take this anymore
You want me back but now I'm gone
I'm over you I'm moving on

Why'd ya lie to me?
Why'd ya cheat on me?
I was blind to see
Don't wanna be the one you need
Baby we are through
I'm really over you
I'm over you

Baby it's over
We can't recover
You can be sure that you aint my lover
Baby it's over
Now that you're out of my life
I'm gonna get on with my life

Why'd ya lie to me?
Why'd ya cheat on me?
I was blind to see
Don't wanna be the one you need
Baby we are through
I'm really over you
I'm over you

Baby it's over
We can't recover
You can be sure that you aint my lover
Baby it's over
Now that you're out of my life
I'm gonna get on with my life

Baby it's over
We can't recover
You can be sure that you aint my lover
Baby it's over
Now that you're out of my life
I'm gonna get on with my life
