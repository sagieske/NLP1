Song:

[Niall]
I figured it out
I figured out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe we had to take some time

[Liam]
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound 
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us? 
Did they ever fight, like us?

[Harry]
You and I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between
You and I
Oh, you and I 

[Zayn]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground

[Louis]
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light, like us
But they never tried, like us

[Harry]
You and I
We don't want to be like them
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us

[Zayn]
'Cause you and I

[All]
We don't want to be like them, 
We can make it 'till the end
Nothing can come between
You and I
Not even the God's above
Can separate the two of us

No, nothing can come between 
You and I
Oh, You and I
You and I
We can make it if we try
You and I
Oh You and I
