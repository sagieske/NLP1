Song:

Will your heart and soul say, yes?
Will your Spirit still say, yes?
There is more that I require of thee;
Will your heart and soul say, yes?

Now will your heart and soul say, yes?
Will your Spirit still say, yes, yes?
If I told you what I really need,
Will your heart and soul say, yes?

(Repeat All)

(Choir)
Soul say, Yes!
(Lead's adlib)
Open up your heart and
Tell the Lord: Yes!
Say: Yes, yeah yeah!
Say:
I'll obey Jesus, I won't stray Jesus
But this time I've made up in my mind, I've made up in my mind
I'll say, say say, Yes!
My soul says yes,
My mind says,
My heart says yes, yes,
Yes I will Jesus,
Yes, Yes!
I'll do what You want me to do
I'll say what You want me to say

I'll go, if You lead me,
If you lead me, if you lead me,
If you lead me,
If you lead me I'll go, yes!

Lift your hands and tell the Lord,
Come on open up your heart and say: Yes, yes, yes!!!

ALL God wants is, YES!
All God wants, all God wants,
All God wants is YES,
I won't be afraid
I'll step out on Your Word
I'll declare Your glory
Yes I will, Yes I will
I wanna do Your will Jesus,
I wanna do your will,
I wanna do your will
My soul says
Yes, yes, yes, yes!!

(Background the whole song)

Yes (repeat)

There is more that I require of thee (repeat)

My soul says:
Yes!...
