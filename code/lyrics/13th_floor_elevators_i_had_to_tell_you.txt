Song:

Chaos all around me,
With it's finger clinging,
But I can hear you singing,
In the corners of my brain.

Every doubt has found me.
Every sound of riot.
Everything is quiet.
But the song that keeps me sane.

I can hear your voice,
Echoing my voice softly.
I can feel your strength,
Reinforcing mine.

If you fear I'll lose my spirit,
Like a drunkard's wasted wine,
Don't you even think about it,
I'm feelin' fine.

I can hear your voice,
Echoing my voice softly.
I can feel your strength,
Reinforcing mine.

If you fear I'll lose my spirits,
Like a drunkard's wasted wine,
Don't you even think about it,
I'm feelin' fine...
