Song:

You can watch your garden grow
And skim along the surface and take it slow
Just let nature have it's way
Let your little flowers bloom where they may
[Chorus:]
If you dig down deeper
Under the ground
Oooh yeah
You got to dig down deeper
Girl you can
If yur wanting to win
Then you better begin
To get a little bit dirty
And to dig deep down
Oooh yeah

You can keep things as they have always been
And you'll never leave the road youve been planting in
Take a chance and make the leap
And anything can happen if you dig down deep

(Reareat chorus)
Come on and dig deep down

Dig down deep and break the streak
(Reapeat three times)
