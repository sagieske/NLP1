Song:

Now keep this to yourself but
My love plays games with me
I don't mean gin or monopoly
Strings me along like some pet animal or other

Why do I play her game
When she can't even remember my name
Wish I could whistle like the "Big Sleep's" famous lover

Hey there, bogart
Could you help me out
Talk to be bogart
What is it all about
Hey there bogart
Proud and brave and strong
Talk to me bogart
What did I do wrong
Help me bogart
If time and space allow
Talk to me bogart
What would you do now

I have to tell you 'bout Chuck
He's indestructible
Well he is six and one half feet tall
And he's witty and pretty and all american, I'm afraid

She thinks that he's so smart
She doesn't know that she's breaking my heart
Which I could wrastle like Hollywood's favourite renegade

Hey there, bogart
Could you help me out
Talk to be bogart
What is it all about
Hey there bogart
Proud and brave and strong
Talk to me bogart
What did I do wrong
Help me bogart
If time and space allow
Talk to me bogart
What would you do now

What did I do wrong help me bogart
If time and space allow
Talk to me bogart
What would you do now.
