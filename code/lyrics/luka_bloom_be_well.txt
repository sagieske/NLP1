Song:

Be well my love
Be well
As you brave
The raging storm

Be well my love
Be well
Into a new world
We are born

Step out on the road
Alone for awhile
Underneath Dublin sky
The quiet grows

Go on through the night
Alone for awhile
Walk along the waterfront
To Sandycobh

Fare thee well my love
Fare thee well
I must go down embrace the sea

Fare thee well my love
Fare thee well
Feel the waves wash over me
