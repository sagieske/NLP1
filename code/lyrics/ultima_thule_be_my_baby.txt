Song:

The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So want you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads
Every place we go
So won't you please

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

I make you happy baby, just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh sieze the day I saw you, I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you till eternity
So wont you please

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So want you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make them turn their heads
Every place we go
So won't you please

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!

Be my, be my baby, be my little baby
My one and only baby - Save me my darling
Be my, be my baby, be my baby now!
