Song:

Remember the day you came to me
And said you found the truth
And I turned away and told you
To take another look

The city you see is going numb
I know you trust
But something's wrong

[Chorus:]
We have our lives to bare
Our bags still burdedned but
We just buy and wear
The plastic version of love, hope
Understanding
We can't survive on candy

A red carpet ride can take your mind away from anything
And I wanna die at every mention of "celebrity"

Like who's doing who
Just how and where
Long as it's not you
I just don't care

Chorus yay
[Chorus:]
We have our lives to bare
Our bags still burdened but
We just buy and wear
The plastic version of love, hope
Understanding
We can't survive on candy

Running far away from all your serious concerns
I know you've learned to use your fairytales
It gets you through the hurt
You're falling
We're falling
And there's just no climbing back
So I'm stolen
I'm stolen
While I'm under full attack

[Chorus:]
We have our lives to bare
Our bags still burdedned but
We just buy and wear
The plastic version of love, hope
Understanding
We can't survive on candy
