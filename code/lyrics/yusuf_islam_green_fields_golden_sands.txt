Song:

Green fields and golden sands
Are all I need, are all I want
Let the wind blow hard, I don't mind

A small house and an olive tree
To keep and feed my family
Let the wind blow hard, I don't mind

One day, we'll all realize
I'm not the only one
Just raise your eyes up
And you'll be gone

To those green fields and golden sands
That's all I need, that's all I want
That's all I really need
Let the wind blow hard, I don't mind

One day, we'll all realize
I'm not the only one
Just raise your eyes up
And you'll be gone

To those green fields and golden sands
That's all I need, that's all I want
That's all I need, that's all I really want
