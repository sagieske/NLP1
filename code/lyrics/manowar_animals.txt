Song:

HEAR THE CALL OF THE WILD IN US ALL
IT WAITS FOR THE NIGHT TO FALL
I'M GETTING HOT, I'M READY FOR THE NIGHT
NO HOLDIN' BACK, LET'S BALL
I'M GONNA GIVE ALL YOU CAN TAKE ALL NIGHT
AND LEAVE YOU IN THE MORNING FEELING RIGHT
I'M AN ANIMAL, THERE'S AN ANIMAL IN ME
GONNA SET IT FREE
I'M AN ANIMAL, THERE'S AN ANIMAL IN ME
GONNA SET IT FREE
I'VE BEEN LOOKING, YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING FROM THE SIDE
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE
OH, YOUR GETTING WET, YOUR WORKING UP A SWEAT
YOUR HAIRS STANDING UP ON END
YOUR SKIN IS SCREAMING, GLAD WE MET?
TONIGHT'S ONE NIGHT YOU WON'T FORGET
I'M AN ANIMAL, THERE'S AN ANIMAL IN ME
GONNA SET IT FREE
I'M AN ANIMAL, THERE'S AN ANIMAL IN ME
GONNA SET IT FREE
