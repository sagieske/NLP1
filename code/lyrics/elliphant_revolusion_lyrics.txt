Song:

Ma! Surrounding tain ma brain…
Am just a city kid,
Ho fall,
Alot.
Just one distraction,
Will sho,
The pain!
N’this a sugar rush,
In cold game„,
Am here,
To do,
Revolusion,...
This is a test,
Not lookin for a home,
But fore a place to die..
Do you, dear to be,
Sceard in this g,?
Then you one of me..
Tonight…
Get one foot in!
Keep one foot out,
It’s al about
Os rumble n shout,
Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!
Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!!
... Acblbrdboom!
I got,
Al to give.
What you luse„
In this ma body mm„
Is a proof of you fier,
Look at me na am a teen wolf,
Playin in the green,
We alone among friends n
Lick are broken dreams…
Get one foot in!
Keep one foot out,
It’s al about
Os rumble n shout,
Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!
Now! Now! Now!
Revolusion!!
Revolusion!
