Song:

I came home and nothing was right
It's been a while since a fight
Well, maybe tonight my need for love
Can blind my sight

And I say things out of spite
Or I push you aside
No, I don't know how to fix it
I am falling apart and I am breaking your heart

Help me to see
'Cause I am blinded by love, blinded by love
And help me to be the one to guide us
Through the dark things we do

Now I know I can be tough sometimes
My words come out like knives
Cutting the space between us
And you try, yeah, I know you try

To just let things slide
But what good is that to us?
Oh, oh, I don't know
I am falling apart and I am breaking your heart

Help me to see
'Cause I am blinded by love, blinded by love
And help me to be the one to guide us
Through the dark things we do

Oh, I don't know what possibly changed
We were so good, so good
And where is the light at the end of this tunnel
'Cause I am falling apart and I am breaking your heart
