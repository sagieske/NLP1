Song:

Livin' way up now in a penthouse high
Our steaks are rare and our martini's dry
Folks below they say it ain't fair
Hell with them, I really don't care
Joie de vivre, mon amie
Ain't this the life

Having a party on a big jet plane
I got so drunk that I could feel no pain
Hangin' out in acapulco,
Drinkin' rum and sniffin' co-co
Pretty senorita look this way
Dancing through the night
Everything's alright
Girlfriend and a wife
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life
Ain't this the life, baby, baby, baby . . .

Tropical island in the deep blue sea
The natives are friendly and the lobster's free
Sipping cognac like a french king
Plenty of room, I own the whole thing
Joie de vivre, mon amie
Ain't this the life

Think I'll go out now on a shopping spree
Breakfast in new york, dinner in parie
Hangin' out with lynn and suzie
Have a massage and a ja'causezi
Climb into bed and see what's on tv
Dancing through the night
Everything's alright
Girlfriend and a wife . . .
Ain't this the life, ain't this the life
Ain't this the life, tell me, tell me, tell me . . .
