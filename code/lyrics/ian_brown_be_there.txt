Song:

You don't wanna go there
Let me lead you by the hand
You don't wanna be there
Over sea and onto land

As I look into your eyes
I pay no mind
I found the way
To get inside you
I'd give you peace of mind

I might see you falling
I might you falling
I might you falling beautiful
This time

I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometime

You don't wanna go there
Let me lead you by the hand
You don't wanna be there
Over sea and onto land

As I look into your eyes
I pay no mind
I found the way
To get inside you
I'd give you peace of mind

I might see you falling
I might see you falling
I might see you falling beautiful
This time

I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometime

Here I am
And there you are
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling

I might see you falling
I might see you falling
I might see you falling beautiful
This time

I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometime

I might see you falling
I might see you falling
I might see you falling beautiful
This time

I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling
I don't see you falling beautiful
Sometime

[* Spoken *]

How do you feel?
How do you feel?

I don't see you falling,
I don't see you falling,

[* Spoken *]

Corrupt, a plea for free will
An irresponsible horror show
It has been suggested
That this contradictory...
