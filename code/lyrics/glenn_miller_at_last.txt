Song:

My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song.
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you.
I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream that I can call my own.
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known.
Oh, you smiled. . .
You smiled and then the spell was cast
Now here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last.
