Song:

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)
Go Gabriel, get the trumpet,
Move on down to the sea,
Don't you sound that trumpet,
Till you hear from me

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)

Take old John on the island,
Place him in a kettle of oil
Then the angels came from Heaven down,
Told them that the oil wouldn't boil

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)

Take old Paul and Silas,
Place them in the jail below.
Then the angels came from Heaven down,
And unlocked the prison house door.

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)

When I get in trouble,
I know I done no crime,
Wake up Central(?) in Glory,
Jesus come to the phone [?]

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)

I've got the keys in my bosom,
I carry it everywhere I go.
I've got the keys in my bosom,
The world can't do me no harm.

I've got the keys to the kingdom,
The world can't do me no harm.
(repeat)
