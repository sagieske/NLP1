Song:

Hypnotized by sounds
Sounds and their imploring
(Repeat)

I was born
Dancing with a squeak in my heart
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
Jumping together
Once I heard it
We were on our way to the dance
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
Sound is forever

Let me in the senseless feeling now that I'm back
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
You can't let it go
Day and night the sounds just try to keep us together
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
We make up forever

Too many games that I played
With my heart when I commit a lie
Well like a child you can learn
You may go it's to know it's the key key key key

(Chourus)
Key key karimba
'Nother foolish name inside a story
You know what I mean
Key key karimba
Hypnotized by sounds
And their imploring
It's changing the scene
(Repeat)

Now I know you finally got a squeak in your heart
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
You can't let it go now
It's in your blood
I see it when I look in your eyes
Ooh-Ooh Dah-Ooh
Let's feel it together!

Too many games that we played
With our hearts when we commit a lie
Just a child you can learn
You may go its to know it's the key key key key

[Chorus:]

(Repeat first 2 verses)

(Chorus, then fade)
