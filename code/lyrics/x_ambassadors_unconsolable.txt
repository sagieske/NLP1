Song:

I hope we stay
Thick as thieves, butter and bread
Pillars of colonial homes
And I wish I could shout you out
False start
Don't get your cane caught in the cracks
Buckle your seatbelts, polluting the airwaves
Single and lonely

And you say you are
Unconsolable
And you say you are
And you say you are
Unconsolable
Uncontrollable
Come up to my house
Drink with my friends
You can lay on my couch
Aching to start all over again
We going back to your room
But wait a minute it's my room
Was it something I said?
Was it something I said?

And you say you are
Unconsolable
And you say you are
And you say you are
Unconsolable
Uncontrollable

Come up to my house
Drink with my friends
You can lay on my couch
Aching to start all over again
We going back to your room
But wait a minute it's my room
Throwing up on my bed
Was it something I said?
I said

I hope we stay
Thick as thieves, butter and bread
Pillars of colonial homes
And I wish I could shout you out
False start
Don't get your cane caught in the cracks
Buckle your seatbelts, polluting the airwaves
Single and lonely

And you say you are
Unconsolable
And you say you are
And you say you are
Unconsolable
Uncontrollable
