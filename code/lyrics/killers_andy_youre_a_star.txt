Song:

One two...

On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah
On the field I remember you were incredible
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah

On the match with the boys, you think you're alone
With the pain that you drain from love
In a car with a girl promise me she's not your world
Cos' Andy you're a star

Get down...

Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah

On the street such a sweet face jump in town
In the staff when the verdict is in
In a car with a girl promise me she's not your world
Cos' Andy you're a star in nobody's eyes but mine

Andy you're a star in nobody's eyes but mine
Andy you're a star in nobody's eyes but mine
Andy you're a star in nobody's eyes
In nobody's eyes but mine.
