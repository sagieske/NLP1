Song:

A chair is still a chair,
Even when there's no one
Sitting there.
But a chair is not a house,
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there
To hold you tight
And no one there
You can kiss goodnight.

A room is still a room
Even when there's nothing there but gloom.
But a room is not a house,
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us
Has a broken heart.

Now and then,
I call your name
And suddenly your face appears.

But it's just,
A crazy game
When it ends,
It ends in tears.

Darling have a heart,
Don't let one mistake
Keep us apart.
I'm not meant to live alone,
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stair
And turn the key please be there.
Still in love with me.

Yea...

I'm not meant to live alone.
Turn this house into a home.
When I climb the stair
And turn the keys.
Please be there,
Still in love
With me.
