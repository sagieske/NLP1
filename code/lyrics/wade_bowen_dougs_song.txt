Song:

If you're ever in Lubbock, Texas, be sure to look me up
I'll be the one on the barstool too damn drunk to get up
I'll be drinkin one for you
Since you said we're through
Without you honey what else can I do

Yeah I got good friends in whiskey, they let me know they care
Every morning, noon, and night-time
Well they're here when you're not there
You can't make a drunk quit drinking
You can't make the waters part
You sure as hell can't mend my broken heart

Father Time has told me, son, she's long gone
But her memory just lingers on, lingers on
Well what else can I say
Guess I gone and lost my way
Her memory died just the other day

Everyday, I go on living
I take each day at a time
When I wake up, I awake in sorrow
As I watch you, walk right on out my door

If you're in Lubbock Texas, be sure to drive on through
We got enough here of your kind, sure as hell don't need you
Well you bothered me too much
Hell you made me write this song
I'll be happy when you're long gone

Yeah I'll be happy
I'll be happy
Well I'll be happy when you're long gone
