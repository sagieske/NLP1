[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse: Royce Da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think things changin' a lot, he f**k with my authority
Then he shall see shells but not by the seashore
If he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
This Grand Eagle's an [?] coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call is siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all n****s been b*****s, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your a** firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that s**t like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new s**t and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
Never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama's gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next b***h
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 50 times a day
Back when 10th grade was like 50 days away
Tryna get paid 50 ways a day
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
26 and I've done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, n****s surprised that the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took longer than 9 months, but f**k it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
One, two I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' out them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your [?], reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Lynwood n***a, them young n****s say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like [?]
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
[?]
They say my city's [?]
So n***a I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I [?] but I ain't [?]
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Zan got me cross eyed like [?]
And these n****s try to copy, [?]
Ask [?], Detroit vs Everybody

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flip that script like ab filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing [?]
If I may reiterate, I don't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a d**k
I still never abc the s**t
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called jd Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day that I would be the s**t
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for [?]
What's makin' you think I need a switch? I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this b***h
Sick of bein' treated like me and s**t
Jesus, I can see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on bet cause if
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, s**t
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here
[?]
Mcs bit off more than they can chew like a base full of Swedish Fish
On a reign with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the bitter [?]
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this s**t, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way I'm sayin' s**t
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'. Detroit!
