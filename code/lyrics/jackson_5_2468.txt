Song:

2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate please say that boy is me
2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate I'm the one who wants to be your baby
Get up early to see you in the morning but you just past me by havin a quarter sitting in the corner
With you I share my time I past your homeroom wishing you were my own girl
Every time I look to see you sit at home but someday you'll notice if you look into my eyes ohhh
2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate please be my pride and joy
2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate I wanna be your lover boy
"I maybe a little fela but my hearts as big as texas, I have all the love a man can give
And maybe a little bit extra
Ooooooooooo be my girl(be my girl)
The first time I wonder why you were in but you said that you talked to me
I stick up for your mess you mean more than a friend to me
He's tryin to be a fela just tryin to tell ya but your changin your mind
He's no price charma still he keeps tryin ya
Girl your so unkind
I can love you really really love you I can tell he's just a friend
I can please you really really please you girl give me just a chance
Ooooooooooooooooo
2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate whatever saves me
2, 4, 6, 8, who do you appriciate don't you no I wanna be your baby yeh baby your babe babe babe
He's tryin to be a fela just tryin to tell ya but your changin your mind
He's no price charma still he keeps tryin ya
Girl your so unkind

Chourus till end
