Song:

When I was born
The doctor said
There's something wrong
Inside that baby head
When I was a boy
In Sunday school
I told them all
That they were fools

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
And so it goes

I went into
The fortune teller's
She wouldn't read
My horoscope
I go into
The laundromat
The people all
Buy extra soap

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
