Song:

One hot angel
One cool devil
Your mind on the fantasy
Livin on the ecstasy
Give it all, give it,
Give it what you got
Come on give it all a lot
Pick it up move it
Give it to the spot
Your mind on a fantasy
Livin on ecstasy

Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Yeah the Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)

One hard ring a bell
Old school rebel
A ten for the revelry
Jamming up the agency
Shake it, Shake it
Take it to the spot
You know she make it really hot
Get it on, give it up
Come on give it all you got
Your mind on a fantasy
Livin on the ecstasy

Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Yeah the Runaway Train yeah
(Running right off the track)
On the Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)

(Angus Guitar Solo)

One hot southern belle
Son of a devil
School boy's spelling bee
A school girl with a fantasy
One hard ring a bell
All screwed up
A ten for the revelry
Jamming up the agency
Shake it, Take it
Take it to the spot
You know
She make it really hot Yeah
Give it all, give it up
Come on give it what you got
You know she's just like it

Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
She's coming off the track
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Give it all, give it up
Come on give it all you got
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
Runaway Train
(Running right off the track)
