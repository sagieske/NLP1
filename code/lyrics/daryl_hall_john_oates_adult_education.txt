Song:

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slams on the plan you had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could put you right

In the lot the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart
Believe it or not, there's life after high school

And that's why the student body got a bad reputation oh yeah, oh yeah
What they need is adult education
Back to school, it's a bad situation, oh yeah, oh yeah
What you want is an adult education, oh yeah

Teacher don't know about how to deal with the student body
And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool
All your girlfriends care about what you wear and talkin' about it
Believe it or not there's life after high school

That's why the student body got a bad reputation oh yeah, oh yeah
What they need is adult education
They go back to school it's a bad situation, oh yeah, oh yeah
But what you want is an adult education, oh yeah

They're calling it preparation
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember

So you got a little education
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it'll rub off on you

The boys are busy in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

The senior with the Junior Miss
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she can graduate to adult
That she can graduate to adult kisses

Adult education
Adult education
Adult education
It's a bad situation
Adult education

Adult, adult
Adult, adult education
Adult education
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Adult, adult, adult
Adult, adult, adult
Adult, adult, adult
