Song:

(feat. Rebecca)

Temptation in my heart,
I'm burning, I fall apart!
When the night falls,
My heart calls for love and devotion.

To asemoneshqam to bodi (You have been my love from heaven)
Setareye man to bodi (You have been my star)
Esme to hast setare, (Your name is star)
Biya pisham dobare (Come back to me again)

Un moohaye meshkit mano kosht (Your dark hair is killing me)
Chesh maye zibat mano kosht (Your beautiful eyes is killing me)
Bia bia pishe man dobare (come come back to me again)
Yalla bego are, setare (yalla say ok, my star)

Temptation in my heart,
I'm burning, I fall apart!
When the night falls,
My heart calls for love and devotion.

Temptation! I Want you
Can you be my only one
When the night falls,
My heart calls, for the touch of your hands

Hama fekro khialam to hasti (You are in my mind all the time)
Donya ye man to hasti (You are my world)
Esme to ro labame (You name is on my lips)
Setare vay setare! (Star! Oh My Star)

Ye omre bedoned khab boodam (A Whole Life, I have been sleeping without you)
Ta man toro peyda kardam (Until I finally found you)
Bia bia pishe man dobare (come come back to me again)
Yalla bego are, setare! (yalla Say ok, My star)

Temptation in my heart,
I'm burning, I fall apart!
When the night falls,
My heart calls for love and devotion.

Temptation! I Want you
Can you be my only one
When the night falls,
My heart calls, for the touch of your hands

Man Enshab toro mikham, wooooooooooo! (Tonight, I Want you wooooo)
Setare toro mikham, woooooooooo (I Want You My star, Woooo)

Chorus X 2:
Temptation in my heart,
I'm burning, I fall apart!
When the night falls,
My heart calls for love and devotion.

Temptation! I Want you
Can you be my only one
When the night falls,
My heart calls, for the touch of your hands

Man Enshab toro mikham, wooooooooooo! (Tonight, I Want you wooooo)
Setare toro mikham, woooooooooo (I Want You My star, Woooo)
