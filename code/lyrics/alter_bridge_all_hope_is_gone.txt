Song:

A tireless stream of indifference flows
Through veins till the river runs dry
I no longer care, I have all but disposed
Of dreams that I once held inside

Desire is gone after all of the years
The fight has been lost and concede
The apathy born a long time ago
Has grown to what I can't defeat

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for
All hope is gone

The sadness I carry so deep in my heart
Of what could've been and might be
Is never forgotten, it's never too far
I'm wasted so worn and so weak

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for
All hope is gone

(Solo)

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
How long must I run
To find what I'm looking for

I've been here too long
I'm tired and longing for more
All hope is gone
All hope is gone
All hope is gone
