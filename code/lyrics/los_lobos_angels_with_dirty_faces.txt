Song:

Broken window smile
Weeds for hair
Strolling 'round the corner
Like a millionaire

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone

With one shoe on
And one shoe lost
Stands a wounded man
Who just laughs it off

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone

Lost a brother last night
To the howling wind
Find an empty doorway
It'll be back again

And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
And the angels with dirty faces
Go it alone
