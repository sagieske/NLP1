Song:

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back
Call me back

Oh my good she's keeps talking and talking
Don't drink too much nanananana

Ohh, f**k you dramaqueen

You have more shoes than a brain can have cells
You f****d my fridge up with your diet coke, hell!

Warm beer at a campfire sucks

End or beginning
It's always the same thing
Cracks in your head
Instead a place in your bed

Sometimes forever
It's always the same thing
You're to precious
To be mislead

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back (x2)

I hate indie rock
No more romantics
I want s** and blood
Almost orgasmic
It's time for rock n roll

This is not, this is not, what I'm longing for
This is not, this is not, what I'm longing for
Light my loincloth mogli runs free
Light my loincloth mogli runs free
This is not what I'm longing for

End or beginning
It's always the same thing
Cracks in your head
Instead a place in your bed

Sometimes forever
It's always the same thing
You're to precious
To be mislead

Hey Mrs. Dramaqueen
What a nice movie scene
Pack up your bags
Piss off and don't call me back (x2)

Wooohooo
Oooh
I f**k you drama queen
Nice and slowly
How you like that
