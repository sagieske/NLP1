Song:

Verse 1:
The blood that Jesus she'd for me,
Way back on Calvary;
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day,
It will never lose it's power.

Chorus:
It reaches to the highest mountain,
It flows to the lowest valley;
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day,
It will never lose it's power.

Verse 2:
It soothes my doubts and calms my fears,
And it dries all my tears;
The blood that gives me strength
From day to day,
It will never lose it's power.

Chorus
