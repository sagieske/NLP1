You are the Lord,
The Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth

And for all You've done and yet to do
With ev'ry breath I'm praising You
Desire of nations and ev'ry heart
You alone are God, You alone are God

You are the Lord,
The Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth

The Morning Star is shining through
And ev'ry eye is watching You
Reveal Thy nature and miracles
You are beautiful, You are beautiful

The Morning Star is shining through
And ev'ry eye is watching You
Reveal Thy nature and miracles
You are beautiful, You are beautiful

You are the Lord,
The Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth

You are the Lord,
The Famous One, Famous One
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth
