Well
pour out the Henn and Coke and fire up that dro' It's
Ludacris off Old National and Godby Road The
block is sold "CLEAR, "!then I shocked the globe I
clock the hoes lock, do's and drop the 'bows I
rock the shows pop; lock and knock yo nose You
Bia' Bia' I, grab my 44. and mop the flo' I
+Mop & Glo'+ the; Feds tryin to stop my dough They
claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow I
bring the pain - c back*** and swing the thang Yo'
girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang And
then I told her - I said it's cool get, at me And
then my voice got raaaassspy Cause
I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes were dazed I
was in the zone coulda, thrown up them tre's And
if you lost Lil', Jon's got some Eastside ways So
stop actin' like a Bia if yo a ain't** blaze [Hook
