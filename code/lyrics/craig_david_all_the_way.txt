Oooo baby
Baby
Ooo oh ohh yeah
Ooo you know about the after party
Oooo ooh
Oh yeah
Alright

If u know you gon' be hittin' the club tonight
Then you gotta make sure that your looking right
Gettin all dressed up (to the nines)
With a fresh hair cut (and)
If your decent and I'm staying around yours tonight
You can jump into a cab there's no need to drive
Keep the glass filled up
Don't feel no pressure
Coz tonight it's alright

And if your feeling lucky
Might find yourself somebody tonight yeah
Gon' just set it off
Think it off
Come step into the party
The vibe is gon' be
Waiting inside
So just get onto the dance floor yeah

[CHORUS]
Stand up
Everybody
Get up now
Move your body
Straight up we're having a party
Coz tonight we're going all the way
Whatever
Hey that's cool with me
Pretty cool girl
Come chill with me
We'll pull up to the after party
Coz tonight we're going all the way

Now the Dj's on the mic and the crowd is hype
Everybody's out on the floor coz the vibe is right
Ladies shaking it up (getting down)
Fellas with their hands up (and)
You can tell this jam is straight off the hook tonight
And there aint nobody in looking to fight
Tryna mess things up
Coz we all came here to party tonight...

You feel this parties started
Now everybody's out on the floor yeah
Just party on party on
We all came here to party
The drinks don't stop till 6 in
The morning (get onto the after party)

[CHORUS X2]

And when the Dj stops at the break of dawn
We'll grab our coats and make our way up to the door
If it's the jamz you want
Then back to mine for sure
(mine for sure girl)
And that's the after party yeah

[CHORUS X2]

[FADE OUT]
