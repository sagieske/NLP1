Song:

Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

I may go broke on a business deal and I phoned up Uncle Lou
He said when I'm back yardin' boy I don't care what you do
Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Well I'm on the phone trying to get a loan and I called up cousin Fred
He said when I'm back yardin' boy ya might as well be dead
Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Well I had to phone my rich Aunt Joan, would ya like to buy some shares?
She said when I'm back yardin' boy I mind my own affairs
Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Old brother Clyde I can't survive if I don't get some loot
He said when I'm back yardin' brother I just don't give a hoot
Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Now don't ya know that business deal came through for me at last
And I really say this back yardin' stuff is really quite the gas
And everybody's on the phone, my relatives wantin' dough
I say it's too bad I'm back yardin' friends but there's one place you can go
Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Back yardin', back yardin' that's a chit chat party in the garden
Just a bbq with a friend or two where you don't give a... Beg your pardon
That's Back Yardin'

Back Yardin'
Back Yardin'
Back Yardin'
