Song:

Oh criminal tell me one thing
You're sickened by humanity
What have you to manage now?
You're one more casuality, I wake up
Won't you Sir take off your make up so we can see you?

I told it to you straight somehow
You didn't hear a thing
It's sad, what a shame
If the western world won't save you now
Then tell me what's your plan?
Will you fight to the end?

Say it, say it out loud
Say it again please, I cannot hear you

It's all lies and mediation
I feel manipulated these days, these days
You're back and forth, you lead us to this
It's only my entire life you banked on my friend
Oh my life's just hanging by a thread
But you played the whole way
Didn't you save me, save me
All that mattered to you was the cash
But you took us for a ride
It didn't last, it didn't last
