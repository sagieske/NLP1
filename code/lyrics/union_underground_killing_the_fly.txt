Song:

I'm sitting in a magic chair
Without Mary and I don't care
So far, so good is what I hear
Nothin' slows me down my dear
Sucking on it what a shame
Another, motherfucker drained
That's what you get I warned you all
Just add it up to my toll

I get a kick outta this
Watch you ball like a bitch
You'll get it you'll get it
You'll get yours motherfucker ain't no lie

I wanna break you
Get off the rocket ride man
I can't even fake it
I'll say it again
You're on a downward slide my friend

So I hear they call it killing the fly
I can't hear it I might be blind
That's what you get I warned you all
Just add it up to my toll
