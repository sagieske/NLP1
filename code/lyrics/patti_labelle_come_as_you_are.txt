Song:

You're a victim of the life you lead
In your heart of hearts you can't concede
That you could be so much more
Can't breathe in this atmosphere
You're afraid you're gonna disappear
Into yourself
And become someone else

Come as you are
I'll be here for you
Come as you are
Let me adore you
My open arms are waiting for you
All you have to do is come as you are

Doesn't matter how you paint your face
There's a beauty that you can't erase
That mirrors the heart of your soul
(Who says) angels aren't suppose to cry
(Who says) that you have to let your life slip by
and never reveal
the passion you feel

Come as you are
I'll be here for you
Come as your are
let me adore you
My open arms are waiting for you
all you have to do is come as you are

You've got to gather up your confidence
and wear it like a halo
open your eyes so you can see...yourself
I will always be right here for you
Just show me what's real
Try to reveal
The passion you feel

Come as you are
I'll be here for you
I'm waiting for you
All you gotta do
All you have to do it
Come as you are
I will adore you
All you have to do
Is come
Come as you are
