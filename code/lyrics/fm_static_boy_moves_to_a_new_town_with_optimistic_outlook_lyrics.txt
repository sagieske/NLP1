Song:

Just woke up, it's a brand-new day
So many things that I wanna say
It's been a while since I've felt this way
Everything's ok, nothing feels broken

First day in a brand-new town
What will it be like, will it all go down?
Everyday I'm gonna write this down
Right here in my diary

And all this time, while the world passes us by
What will we leave behind, but the pages of our lives?
And if we take our time, I bet we can all find
The things in life worth living for

One thing I know is that when life's moving slow
I'm not out here on my own, I've got You (to get me through this)
I'm on a long journey through mountains of apathy
And I'm not afraid to walk through

Everywhere I look it's all so different
Another city but it makes no difference
Still going through the same old issues
Everything's ok, nothing feels broken

With the days of the old behind me
Another summer and I feel like climbing
Write another page while the sun's still shining
Right here in my diary

And all this time, while the world passes us by
What will we leave behind, but the pages of our lives?
And if we take our time, I bet we can all find
The things in life worth living for

One thing I know is that when life's moving slow
I'm not our here on my own, I've got You (to get me through this)
I'm on a long journey through mountains of apathy
And I'm not afraid to walk through

Fading, hating, waiting for some place where I can fit in
Show me, grow me, hold me, till my balance starts to set in
Fading, hating, waiting for some place where I can fit in
Show me, grow me, hold me, till my balance starts to set in

All this time, while the world passes us by
What will we leave behind, but the pages of our lives?
And if we take our time, I bet we can all find
The things in life worth living for

(2, 3, 4)

One thing I know is that when life's moving slow
I'm not out here on my own, I've got You (to get me through this)
I'm on a long journey through mountains of apathy
And I'm not afraid to walk through
