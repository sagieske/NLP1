Song:

I've come to get my blessing
I've gotta get my breakthrough
The power of my praise
Gives me strength so I can press on through

So I gotta stretch
Stretch forth, reaching for my blessing
So I gotta press
Press forth, reaching for my blessing

{Gotta get my} gotta get my blessing
{I believe he'll work a} miracle
The power of my praise
Give me strength so I can press on through

Chorus
{So I gotta} Stretch
Stretchin for it, reaching for my blessing (3x)
Oh-Oh(after 1st & 3rd)

Bridge
I'm still believing for my miracle my faith says
It's special it's marvelous and it's wonderful
Wonderful

Reach for it (4x)
The mark, the prize, the higher calling

The mark, the prize, the higher calling
Stretch for it(4x)
The mark, the prize, the higher calling

It's mine, gotta get my blessing(4x)
The mark, the prize the higher calling
