Ryan: A part for me?

S: Well of course!
Are:(yeah right)
S: You gotta believe it!
Are: (keep talkin')

S: You and I, all the fame
Are: Sharpay and what's-his-name
S: Sound exciting?
Are: Inviting.
S: Let's do it then!
Are: (listening!)

S: Personal stylist, agent and a publicist
Are: But where do I fit into this?
S: With you we can win!
Are: win the part?
S: Think bigger!
Are: Become superstars
S: (that's better)

Don't you see that
Bigger is better
And better is bigger
A little bit is never enough

No no no!

Don't you want it all?
You want it, you know that you want it
The fame and the fortune and more! (You want it all!)
You want it, you know that you want it
You gotta have your star on the door

You want the world, nothing less
All the glamour and the press
Only givin' you the best
Reviews (say it!)

I want it all!
I want it, I want it, (yeah) want it
My name in lights at Carnegie Hall
I want it all!

Sharpay: Can't you see it?
Ryan: Yeah!
Sharpay: They're gonna love me.
Ryan: Mhmm (clears throat)
Sharpay: I mean, us.

S: Red carpet, rose bouquets, crowd waiting backstage
Are: I'm with her, don't stop me, I'm not the paparazzi
S: Invitations, standing ovations
Are: Magazines
S: (yes please)
Gotta be celebrities!

Photographs, fan club, give the people what they love
S: Now you're excited
Are: (I like it)
S: Let's do it then!
Are: (yeah!)

Times Square, jet setters, sequels pay better
New York today, tomorrow the world!
Are: Sold out shows!
S: (think bigger!)
Are: And the Oscar goes to...
S: (that's better!)

Don't you see that
Bigger is better
And better is bigger
A little bit is never enough

No no no!

I want it all!
I want it, I want it, I want it
The fame and the fortune and more!
I want it all!
I want it, want it, want it
I gotta have my star on the door

I want the world, nothing less
All the glamour and the press
Only givin' you the best reviews

I want it all!
I want it, want it, want it
Radio, city Music Hall
We want it all!

Are: Here in the spotlight we shine
Look at who we are
S: When Broadway knows your name
You know that you're a star!

Dance!
