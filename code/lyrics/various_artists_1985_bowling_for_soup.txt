Song:

Debbie just hit the wall,
She never had it all,
One Prozac a day,
Husbands a CPA,
Her dreams went out the door,
When she turned 24,
Only been with one man,
What happened to her plan?

She was gonna be an actress,
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her
On the hood of White Snapes car
Her yellow SUV
Is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been all right

Since

Bruce Springsteen,Madonna,
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
Music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's un-cool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19,19,1985

1985

She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
Even St. Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to wam
Not a big Limp Bizcut fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran

Wheres the mini skirt
Made of snake skin
And whos the other guy
That's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become TV
What ever happened to
Sit-coms, gameshows

On the radio was

Springsteen,Madonna,
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
Music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's un-cool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19,19,1985

She hates time
Make it stop
When did Motley Crew
Become classic rock
And when did Ozzy
Become an actor
Please make this
Stop, stop, stop

And bring back

Springsteen,Madonna,
Way before Nirvana
There was U2, and Blondie
Music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's un-cool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19,19,1985
