Song:

Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o'er the plains,
And the mountains in reply,
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsis deo
Gloria in excelsis deo

Shepherd why this jubilee,
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song

Come to bethlehem and see
Christ whos birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the lord the new-born king
Gloria in excelsis deo (lots of times)
