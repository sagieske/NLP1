Song:

Baby's on fire, it's a beautiful thing
Baby's on fire, it's beginning to sing
Baby's on fire, so imaginative
Nobody else gets to see it and live
Baby's on fire, the moonlight skin
Black and white cinema, outa Berlin
Black and white cinema, flooding inside
Baby's on fire in the submarine tide
Baby's on fire
And I
I'm in flames
I been workin' all day
Baby and I are gonna get it away
I been workin' all day, and all I know
Baby's on fire, the higher and higher we go
And I
I'm in flames
