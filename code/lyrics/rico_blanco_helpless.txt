Song:

The morning wakes
I find myself entangled
In visions of your warm embrace
I pour some coffee
And slowly swirl in mem'ries
Of the night we watched the stars fade into space

Chorus:
I'm addicted to your
Tender kisses and it's
Keepin me up all night
I didn't expect that I'd be
So affected every
Time you look me in the eyes
I become so helpless
Helpless

Day moves along
The symptoms only aggravate like
Wishing for a passerby
To stop a while
And listen to my story of
How much brighter you've made my life
