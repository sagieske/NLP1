Song:

Empty streets
I follow every breath into the night
The wind so cold
The sun is frozen, the world has lost its light
I carry your picture deep in me
Back to you a 1000 seas
Back to us
Don't you lose your trust and your belief
Just trust me

We have to go 1000 oceans wide
One 1000 dark years when time has died
1000 stars are passing by
We have to go 1000 oceans wide
1000 times against an endless tide
We'll be free to live our life

I know somewhere
We'll find a little place for you and me
It all turned out a different way
Can't feel the pulse in our veins
So weak today
We'll let our heart beat guide us through the dark
Just trust me

We have to go 1000 oceans wide
One 1000 dark years when time has died
1000 stars are passing by
We have to go 1000 oceans wide
1000 times against an endless tide
We'll be free to live our life

There's nothing and no one we'll miss
And one day we'll look back with no regrets
1000 Oceans wide
1000 Endless years have died
1000 Oceans wide
1000 Stars are passing by
Passing by

Please don't drift away from me
Please don't drift away from me

We have to go 1000 oceans wide
One 1000 dark years when time has died
1000 stars are passing by
We have to go 1000 oceans wide
1000 times against an endless tide
Then we'll be free

Please don't drift away from me
Please don't drift away from me
1000 Oceans wide
