Song:

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Uh, Most of these n****s shouldn’t be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Ya wig’ll get told, put the realest n****s
N****s, product of cap pillers, gangbangers and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, [click](undefined) boom the ghetto bird ya shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my [background](undefined)
But nah homie, put the mask on when I [slide](undefined) on ‘em
Put the [cash](undefined) in the safe and here’s a extra slug ‘for I shake
Ya smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a [wet](undefined) break on a plate
Burning ya faith, all senses covered in tape
Fuckin’ with them boys in blue, chill out ‘for rags at you
You running to the cops saying: How we do?
Saying it’s just rap and them lines ain’t true
So I just threw Q, f**k it, menage a two or maybe trois
Baby girl need a [pot](undefined) pie, I be her da da
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, Oxymoron

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain’t no backpack rapper, I ain’t no lyricist
And if he ain’t talking to you mind ya business then
Cold with it, Black Hippie, yeah we cold n****s
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that yawk. Watching domes shatter
It’s Top Dawg we runnin’ rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don’t run with cats, nine double O five nine -
Where my family at
Pull up in that [family van](undefined) holding 2’s like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin’
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
’Til I’m finished, ‘Til I make a couple tickets
Then I’m outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide ya feelings, now can I [live](undefined)?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
’Cause everywhere I go they like when you dropping some work?
Been a threat since birth
The rap game’s pallbearer when I’m droppin’ the Hearst
I ain’t new to this, I’m true to this
Industry’s nightmare, red strings in my Nike Air’s
Yeah, the white pair, I’m Jay Rock, America’s most wanted
My chargers? Killing mc’s without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab Soul]
It’s Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I’m the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing the sticky
All eyes against me, still even the score
Prolly why I’m always ot on tour
Tde, believe me we want war
I don’t even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, Two triggers, What’s the difference?
We all gon’ die one day until then I’m gettin’ paid
My grandma watching so I ain’t gon’ curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of og
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin, Ah
And these days are so [bitter sweet](undefined)
I guess it’s just a balance we battle naturally
And y’all still trippin’ off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep Soul brother number 2
The first one used to make beats for cl Smooth
Top got the s550 but the cl smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L’s move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
Ay, I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it’s ya little n***a brother
You ain’t meant for corners, it’s what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a s*** in the [back](undefined)
[Fattest](undefined) [elephant](undefined) a**, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we [diamond](undefined) just shining and they gon’ find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with ya bitchh
For the [record](undefined) in Guinness I’m a hecklin’ menace
Where is Robin, I’m Given’
Fuckin’ minding my business
He a regular victim, us regular in women
Uh, regular n****s, you always cater to s***s
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I’m put ya muthafuckin’ dream in ya face
You keep lookin’ for some women to be all in ya face
That deep dussy reach n****s, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a n***a be dussy
You can never rap better than me, ’cause you ain’t dedicated
You ain’t underrated, you ain’t under looked
You ain’t overbooked, you just under cooked
It’s supposed to be me and my n****s in the [record](undefined) [book](undefined)
Now they got by myself still fresh as f**k

[Verse 5: Kendrick]
I hate y’all, I’d do anything to replace y’all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy ‘til I’m unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick a** and then kick knowledge
I’m way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I’m the master that masturbated on ya favorite mc
’Til the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I’m about to crack the Da Vinci Code, yeah
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots will never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop and my foot in the back of yo a**
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve n****s like Master Geoffrey
Jump on this curb turn a shot in a verb if you let me
You know I’m a killer, I’m on ya head, you know I’m a killa
The West Coast cosa nostra under oath ‘til it’s over
Ya over owe us so what the f**k?
I f**k you n****s up, I f**k you n****s up, she suck and f**k
I fuckin’ duck you fuckin’ n****s like when I want
You going dutch, you going fuckkin’ nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, n***a
I’m more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing [back](undefined) and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing data
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this s**t up
I feel like some of y’all is hating
Quite frankly ya b***h booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say “Hold up wait a minute”
Your career ain’t s**t less you got some Kendrick in it
Ya p***y ain’t s**t, ain’t no rumors left on my d**k
'Less you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the c***, muah
Hollywood’s been good to me little hood n***a used to pawn mom’s jewelry
Family jewels big as f**k and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin out till spalding need a replacement
And I’m outchea, the rest of your mouth chea
Invest in a vest, a Vietnam vet when you out near
The White court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin’ a woman, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats, shook
Ya scared to death, scared to look in the mirror when Kendrick is near ya
King Kendrick
