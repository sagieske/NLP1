Song:

They should give an award for cheating
You'd be on top of the world
And I should call you a heyyy
For deceiving
But I'm just better than that

Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats, ooo-ooho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats for that.

I try to think that you're not crapping
But you were texting late on night
When you're think I was sleeping, sleeping
I can tell your bother
In your way of speaking, speaking
And ain't your girlfriend on the phone
When you said you're leaving.

You had so many lies
He's just a random guy
You started a fight
So just you can pack your sheets and go.
No matter how we try
We never seem to fight
This time I'm saying goodbye.

They should give an award for cheating
You'd be on top of the world.
And I should call you a heyyy
For deceiving
But I'm just better than that

Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats for that

Say you're at mall
But girl you're lying.
Girl you are a liar
...
Watching buying it
I'm not the guy to say I'm leaving
But lately I'll be back
In force without this demons.
Now we're having ups and downs
You've stared a fight
Just to pack your sheets and go.
No matter how we try
We never seem to fight
This time I'm saying goodbye.

They should give an award for cheating
You'd be on top of the world.
And I should call you a heyyy
For deceiving
But I'm just better than that

Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats, ooo-oho
Congrats for cheating.
Congrats for that.
