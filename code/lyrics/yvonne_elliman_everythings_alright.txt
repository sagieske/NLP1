Song:

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to problems that upset you oh
Don't you know everything's alright yes, everything's fine
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try we'll get by so forget about all us tonight
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine

Woman your fine ointment -- brand new and expensive
Could have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted -- we could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry, people who are starving
Matter more than your feet and hair

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and annoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead oh
Don't you know everything's alright yes everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got
Think! While you still have me
Move! While you still see me
You'll be lost
You'll be so so sorry
When I'm gone

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and annoint you
Myrrh for your hot forehead oh
Don't you know everything's alright yes everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax, think of nothing tonight
Close your eyes, close your eyes and relax
