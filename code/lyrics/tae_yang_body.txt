Song:

Your body’s so beautiful

Areumdawo
Ne gaseum heori eongdeongi balkkeutkkaji
Modu yeppeo
Ne momjit sonjit nunbit modeun ge nunbusyeo

I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody
I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody

My meori eokkae mureup bal
It’s better than yours

Maeil mannado nan yeojeonhi seolle
Saehayan pibu gyeori nal aetage hae
Geu eotteon nuga bwado neon s*** lady
Nae kkeo raneun ge mitgyeojiji anha

Nan oneuldo neol gamsanghae
Ireoke maeil bam nal michige hae
Deo museun mari pillyohae
Neo hanamyeon chungbunhae
Now you got me singin’

Never seen a girl like you
You make me go
Cause I ain’t never seen a body like yours
You make me go

I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody
I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody
My meori eokkae mureup bal
It’s better than yours

Jakku chyeodabwado ajikdo nollae
Neoui geu wanbyeokhami nal chumchuge hae
Seonggyeogeul darmeundeutan dodohan mommae
Neol bomyeon nae body neun

Jjukppeodeun neoui gindariwa
Jallokhage yeppeun heoriseon
Hyanggiroun galsaek meoritgyeol
Nareul sara sumswige hae

Your body’s so beautiful

I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody
I got that body
You got that body
Now you and me lets make somebody

Areumdawo
Now you and me lets make somebody
Modu yeppeo
Now you and me lets make somebody
