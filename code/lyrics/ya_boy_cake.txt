(Money, money, money, money)
{Cake}

Ya boy don't play
I rap but I'm strapped
Gyea I represent the hood got the Bay on my back
I ain't neva been a sucka ask my uncle Phat Rat
Before rap I was gettin my {Cake} off a crack
F**k the world till I die I'm feelin just like dat
Somebody call the president tell em Tupac back
With a mouth full of diamonds, Giants hat all black
I'm the greatest we can even bet the {Cake} on dat
Gyea
Boom when I approach the hammer
Get hit with a red beam like the grocery scanner
Paranoid so I filled the whole crib full of planners(?)
I like jewlery but I'm spendin all my{Cake} on Atlanta(?)
Yeah I got a full house like Stephanie Tanner
And the clip on the K look like a banana
All black burner(?) gloves
All black Phantom
I'm the kush man hold the big sack like Santa
Piece of {Cake} no challenge
Gettin green like salad
Told the homies where you at
It's green like havok murderin is a habit
Expecially when we step in the booth it's automatic for the
(Money) the (money) the (money) the (money) the {Cake}
You ni***z betta pump yo brakes
Ya Boy don't play
I'm rap but I'm strapped
Put you ni***z underground
Put my city on the map
Keep a vest on my chest and a gauge on my lap
And yes money talks cause for the {Cake} you gettin clacked
Ask about me in New York
I'm the truth it's a fact
And everybody know the Bay
Ya Boy drops it's a rap
I don't need you friendship
You ain't gotta have my back
All I need in this world is {Cake} and a Mac
I'm the Luke Skywalker
Rhyme talkers I got bars
F**k a movie Ya Boy ready to war with stars
I gotta flow outta this world it's on Mars
The Earth upped and baked it in a {Cake} like f**k cigars
My hoes walk around topless like Mardigras
It's the gutter side of hip hop it's too many parties on
Rappin bout the streets erybody knows you not involved
I don't think you hard no n***a not at all
Sweetest {Cake} from the bakery
B***h there ain't no fakin me
Say it real n***a till the undertaker takin me
Past the blind even they can see my pockets got no vacancy
It's Ya Boy be makin me some (money) some (money) some (money) some (money)
