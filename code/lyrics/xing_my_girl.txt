Song:

Hoo~ oh, ye~ yo my girl my love my girl yo my girl my love my girl
You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
On the good days and bad days and times you need someone to lean on
I'll always be there for you You're my girl

When I open my eyes to your voice in the morning I can't help but keep smiling all day
When we're together I want to hold you forever and never let go of you baby
Don't wanna go chasing after this love This can disappear anytime
When I am in doubt I will remember your smile Forever, I will love you girl

You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
On the good days and bad days and times you need someone to lean on
I'll always be there for you You're my girl

If there is anything I could say to show my love I would say them to you right away
Even if I went around this world there'd be nothing to show how much I really adore you girl
I'm afraid this can turn into memories But I'll try not to think of it
'Cause a lifetime's not enough to be loving you Forever, I will love you

You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
On the good days and bad days and times you need someone to lean on
I'll always be there for you You're my girl

Oh dear God Don't let this relationship fade away Without her I couldn't even go on Because I love her so
Because I cherish her I'll never let go of this love

You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
You are the only one I want You're the only one I love Pinky promise you this from the bottom of my heart
On the good days and bad days and times you need someone to lean on I'll always be there for you
You are the one You are my love~ My Girl woah yeah~ I will be there for you~
Yo my girl my love my girl yo my girl my love my girl yo my girl my love my girl yo my girl my love my girl
