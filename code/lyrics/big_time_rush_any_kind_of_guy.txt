Song:

[Verse:]
Here I am
There you are
Why does it seem so far?
Next to you is where I should be (where I wanna be)
Something I
Want so bad
Know what's inside your head
Maybe I could see what you see (tell me what you see)

[Pre-chorus]
I Gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine
If you're staying or leaving
I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending?
Open your eyes
I can be what you need

[Chorus:]
Any kind of guy you want, girl
That's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind of guy you want, girl
You know I'll agree
Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide
Change your mind
I will be there
Won't you try
One more try
Be my any kind of girl
You decide
It's alright
I will be there

[Verse 2:]
You seem so hard to know
Say goodbye, say hello
Then you say that it's time to go (now it's time to go)
Changing my point of view
Everyday something new
Anything to get next to you (gotta get to you)

[Pre-chorus]
Gotta keep on believing
That everything takes time
I'll make up any reason
To make you mine
If you're staying or leaving
I'll follow your lead
So why keep pretending
Open your eyes
I can be what you need

[Chorus:]
Any kind of guy you want, girl
That's the guy I'll be (that's the guy I'll be)
Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind of guy you want, girl
You know I'll agree (you know I'll agree)
Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide
Change your mind
I will be there (I'll be there)
Won't you try
One more try
Be my any kind of girl
You decide
It's alright
I will be there

[Bridge:]
Let me know if I'm getting through
Making you understand
If it's wrong I'll try something new
(Try something New)
Don't look away
Cause I'm here to stay
If it's a game
Then I'm gonna play

[Chorus:]
Any kind of guy you want, girl
That's the guy I'll be
Turn myself upside down (yes I will, yes I will)
Any kind of guy you want, girl
You know I'll agree (you know I'll agree)
Turn your whole world around (yes I will, yes I will)

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide
Change your mind
I will be there (I'll be there)
Won't you try
One more try
Be my any kind of girl
You decide
It's alright
I will be there

Bring it back

Any kind, any kind
Any kind of guy you want
You decide
It's alright
I will be there
