Song:

How many times have
You heard someone say.
If I had his money,
I could do things my way.
But little they know
That it's so hard to find,
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind.
Once I was winning
In fortune and fame.
Everything that I dreamed for,
To get a start in lifes game.
Then suddenly it happened,
I lost every dime.
But Im richer by far
With a satisfied mind.
Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old.
Or a friend when you're lonely,
Or a love that's grown cold.
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times.
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind.
When life has ended
And my time has run out.
My friends and my loved ones
Will leave, there's no doubt.
But there's one thing for certain
When it comes my time.
Ill leave this old world
With a satisfied mind.
How many times have
You heard someone say.
If I had his money,
I could do things my way.
But little they know
That it's so hard to find,
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind.
