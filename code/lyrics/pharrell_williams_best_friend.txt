Song:

Yeah, ye... Spit my gum out right now... Haha
What up world? Got my insperation in the studio with me, right?... Feelin' good
Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all n****s... Yessur, hey

[Verse:]
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a f*****g therapist
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness...
[cork pops] There goes the top, n***a, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
'cause 15 years later the other died that summer... Bummer

[Chorus:]
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).
See, you wont even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my n***a let it out

[Verse 2:]
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, n***a was action packed
That's Atlantis appartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack
And when they shoot you n***a, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many n****s will rise
So many them n****s try
So many them n****s ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same n****s, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell n****s something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, n***a strive
Devine intervention this is
I heard a voice n***a, listen to this

[Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Jesus will arange it, but Jesus wont change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, n***a don't articulate and??,
I. E. We best friends, speak best friends language
I'm a happy n***a, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'cause you both on bate, bbc and chainless
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess
First time you get caught, now your a** is famous
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop
N***a rewind and reverese slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or f**k it n***a, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, n***a
Sucess is taingeable, don't wait for fame
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank

[Chorus:]

Star Track, is who we are [x4]
