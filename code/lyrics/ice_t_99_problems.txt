Song:

Yeah, last year a lot of motherfuckers asked me
Why I didn't do no old s** nasty s**t
But this year I went down to Miami and got my n***a from 2 Live
Brother Marquis in the house! (Yeah I'm the motherfuckin nigga)
Yeah, we gonna answer the question about girl problems
All these ni***z is havin girl problem, Marq
(Huh, tell them man, tell them how it is)
Lemme tell you what time is it...

I got a ho from the East, got a ho from the West
Got a ho that likes to jack it off and rub it in her chest
I got a ho from the North, a ho from the South
A ho that likes to suck it long and hold it in her mouth
I got a b***h with hair, a b***h with none
A b***h with a knife, a b***h with a gun
A b***h with a a** big as a tv set
And there's a b***h over there; hey, the one I'm gonna get
But yo but maybe not, she might not like me though
No sweat to a vet; I'll slam a sista though, word
Ice in the whole damn herd
I f**k 'em all and leave 'em on the curve
I got a b***h with a mink, who rocks a fat gold link
Who likes to f**k me with her a** up on the kitchen sink
Got a b***h with t***, a b***h with a**
A b***h with none, but hey I give her a pass
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I'll be there for you son
Got 99 problems and a b***h ain't one - hit it...
Nah a b***h ain't one

[Ice-T]
I got a b***h that's old, a b***h that's new
A b***h who love velvet in the colors blue
I got a b***h who's fat, a b***h who's built
A b***h who all her titties give out powdered milk
I got a b***h who's funny, a b***h who ain't
A b***h who can sing, a b***h who cain't
A b***h who loves fuckin on a airplane..
I even got a b***h off +Soul Train+
I got a b***h who rolls a rag-top Benz..
Long ends
I got a b***h who's broke as a bum..
But she's the most fun
I got a b***h who play piano, a b***h who don't
A b***h who dances naked, a b***h who won't
A b***h who's short, a b***h who's tall
A b***h who burns my pager with priority calls
And I love 'em all, I love 'em crazily
And they love me back - that's why they stay with me
So if you havin girl problems, I'll be there for you son
Got 99 problems and a b***h ain't one - hit me

Yo Marquis - you from Miami man why don't you show
These motherfuckers all the over the world; the 2 Live style
Of how the b*****s treat a motherfuckin fly n***a like you

[Brother Marquis]
I got 99 problems and a b***h ain't one of them
I don't trip on hos, cause I don't need none of them
Pussy's the temptation, dick's the persuasion
All hos suck c*** n***a how you play 'em?
That's why I don't sleep on 'em, I just freak on 'em
Stick d**k in they mouth; take it out and I skeet on 'em
The n***a the one-nighter, the b***h exciter
I only love my hos when I'm goin up inside her
Problem number one is gettin money
I'd rather taste the green than sip the honey
So don't expect nuttin cause I ain't offerin
I go hard on my b*****s, cause I'm never never softenin
Puttin the demand on 'em, f**k 'em and scram on 'em
The "wham, bam, thank you ma'am" game is ran on 'em
So f**k how you feel, you fuckin cheap thrill
I hope you took the pill cause I won't pay the bill
Gettin pussy's just another expense
If p***y pays the bills then d**k pays the rent
I only need a ho for one thing and that's to c**
I've got 99 problems and a b***h ain't one!
