Song:

(Steve Dale Jones/Billy Henderson)

I walk in the rain and whistle a tune
I talk to the man up there in the moon
I know I may sound like somebody gone insane
I'm a fool about you baby but my heart can't explain

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart

It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand
It means like a drum in a marching band
Can't help what it does I just follow where it leads
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me

It's a little left of center
By heavenly design
Love gets carried away
And goes wild at times
When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart

When cupid aims his arrow
It's right on the mark
A little left of center
Just like my crazy heart
