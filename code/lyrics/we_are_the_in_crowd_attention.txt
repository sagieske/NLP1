Song:

We're all just weird kids in the end

Attention
I'll walk you through this slowly if you're still listening
Here's your penny back for stealing our thoughts
All for the sake of wanting more
Play it safe while you keep score
And one day we might find
That peace of mind that we lost in the first place

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back
Is believing that I need a change

We are (We are the) the only friends we have
And if there's nothing left and I fall
You don't fall apart
We're all just weird kids in the end

I tied up my laces, left my loose ends hanging
On the words that I have wished that I said
Memories that keep me up in bed

Should've, could've, would've stayed the way I've been
If it wasn't for means there'd be no end
To sleepless nights in parking lots
That light the way to make a better me

If I could write these feelings into a greater meaning
They'd fall on deaf ears (fall on deaf ears)

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back
Is believing that I need a change

We are (We are the) the only friends we have
And if there's nothing left and I fall
You don't fall apart

We don't fall apart
We don't fall
We don't fall
We don't fall
We don't fall apart

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back
Is not believing

We are (We are the) the only friends we have
And if there's nothing left and I fall
We don't fall apart

I know the way I wanna be
But I'm trapped in who I am
The only thing that holds me back
Is believing that I need a change

We are (We are the) the only friends we have
And if there's nothing left and I fall
We don't fall apart
We're all just weird kids in the end

We're all just weird kids
