Song:

If I feel like a loser
If I lock myself out
If I lost all my money
Would you close the door when I need someone to talk to
When I'm drunk at the bar, when I fear it's all over
I would turn to you

When youґre dead broke you donґt ask for money
On a sunday you don't talk to God
Cause youґre to damn proud to reach out when you need it
But someday you will need a friend
You will need a friend like me

If you feel like a loser
If you lock yourself out
If you lost all your money
Would you turn to me

When you need someone to talk to
When your stuck at the bar
When you fear it's all over
I would not turn away

When youґre dead broke you donґt ask for money
On a sunday you don't talk to God
Cause youґre to damn proud to reach out when you need it
But someday you will need a friend
You will need a friend like me
