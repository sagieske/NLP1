Song:

Ahehe hem ahahahem C'mon and listen to the mole rat
Nehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehneh
Nehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehneh
Nehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehneh
Nehnehnehnehneh Hit it!

Yo listen up have a holla from ron
Naked mole rap is the name of this song
Here's a story, you know its glory and its hot
Bet you don't the truth is how ron met rufus
Never heard a cat whine,
Never heard a puppy purr.
My dad's alergic to every kind of fur.
So I searched for hairless pets
On the internet.
Saw a pet with a pink thing,
Gonna need some sun screen!
(Ah!)

[Chorus:]
What is that?
That freaky thing?
(yes that's right
Its a naked mole rat)
C'mon yall,
Let the girlies sing!
(Listen to the naked mole rap)

Uh huh
Yeh,
Uh!

What is that,
That freaky thing?
Yes that's right its a naked mole rat,
C'mon I can't hear the girlies sing
Listen to the naked mole rap

Nehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehnehneh,
Nehnehnehnehnuh....

I heard smarty Mart was havin' a sale,
On a hairless pink rodent,
With a long skinny tail.
I said this could be a soloution
The perfect pet,
For my dads sacred constitution?
So,
The manager came,
To open the cage.
He said:
"You know this pet is hairless."
I said:
" I couldnt care less!"
Handed him to me,
Said:
"careful,
Don't drop it!
And do want this cage"
"No I'll keep 'im in ma pocket"
(Yeah, hey!)
(Yay!)

[Chorus:]

What is that,
That freaky thing?
Yes that's right its a naked mole rat
Gonna buy me, some bling bling
Listen to the naked mole rap

Can't top it don't drop it you might just pop it.
