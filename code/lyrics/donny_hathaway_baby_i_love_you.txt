Song:

If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid, baby, just ask
You know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh, and I do declare
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms, little boy you're gonna get it

Cause I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
There ain't no doubt about it
Baby, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you

If you really wanna kiss me
Go right ahead, I don't mind
All you got to do is snap your fingers
And I'll come a runnin', I ain't lyin'
Oh, what'cha want, little boy, you know you got it
I'd deny my own self before I'd see you without it

Cause I love you
(Baby, baby, baby, I love you)
There ain't no doubt about it
Baby, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
Baby, I love you

Some day you might want to run away
And leave me sittin' here a cryin'
But if it's all the same to you, baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye (goodbye)
Baby, I love you, baby I need you, baby I want you
Don't let your neighbors tell you I don't want you
Don't let your low down friends tell you I don't need you
