"remember me"

--------------------------------------------------------------

Please remember! This translation is my personal work. It is sometimes difficult to translate word for word from spanish to english, so it may sound awkward in one languange when it is perfectly natural in the other. But I think you can get the general idea!

Oh, today I remembered you
When I heard our song
I returned for a moment
To the happiest times
That I spent with you mi amor
Sometimes I wonder
If you also remember
Those moments of our love
How I wish I could know
If you also think of me
Thinking of you, I want you here
Remember me, mi amor
If I could, I would give you the world
In order to have you here
Remember, remember
Remember me
Remember, remember
Remember me
