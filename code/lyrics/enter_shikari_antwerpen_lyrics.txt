Song:

Now I was feeling like a total giant! 
But now it feels like Silvius Brabo has sliced my hand off and thrown it in the river! 

Now I was just doing my job, 
My feet sink into the bed of the Scheldt
But now my fingers are reeling about with the fishes
I know I'm not making mwwaking any sense (no you're not)
All will be reveiled (well I hope so)
All will be reveiled if we travel back in time

I've got to rest, it's for the best
To build a nest, to take the quest
To be given just one chance to be the best

Go forth and re-colonize
It appears the foundations of all our great nations
Are lies and indoctrinations
So if Silvius Brabo collects the hands of giants
Will you join him?
