Song:

Let's go back to the start
Like it use to be
Before you fell apart
And you blamed it on me
Back when you were my friend
Do you remember back then
All the plans that we made
Can we get back to those days

Those days come every now and again
No way I feel like this is the end but

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I
Always

Let's go back to the start
Like it use to be
Before your broken heart
And your hatred for me
Back when all this began
Do you remember back then
All the plans that we made
Can we get back to those days


Those days I don't I don't know what I pretend
No way I feel like this is the end but

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I
Always

Is there any wonder I'm not right
Where do we go now where do we go now
Is there any wonder you won't fight
Where do we go now where do we go now
Have there been to many wrongs to right
I'd say goodbye but

Always is in your eyes
In always I realize
That always is you and I
Always
