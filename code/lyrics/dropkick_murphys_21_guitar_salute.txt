Ready, Aim, Fire

You work all fucking week,
Go out on Friday night
You're looking for some action
And you settle for a fight

Okay, steady, get ready
Everybody pull in the loot
We got the equalizer
It's a 21 guitar salute

It's a 21 guitar salute, it's a 21 guitar salute
It's a...

Well, I'm sitting here, Drinking my beer
And I'm waiting for the war
It's 10 o'clock on a Saturday night and I'm so fucking bored

Okay, steady, get ready
Everybody gets to shoot
We got a 21 gun salution
It's a 21 guitar salute

It's a 21 guitar salute, it's a 21 guitar salute
It's a...

[solo]

Okay, steady, get ready
Everybody pull in the loot
We got the equalizer
It's a 21 guitar salute

It's a 21 guitar salute, it's a 21 guitar salute
It's a...

I hear the sounds of marching feet in the distance
And there's a bloody revolution in the air
And I know what this looks like, but it isn't
'cause I just want to blow something up
