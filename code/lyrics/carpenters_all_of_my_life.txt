Song:

All of my life I have been waiting

For just one boy

And all of my life I have been waiting

For all the joy of having

(*) Someone that I can call my own

Who'll come to my side when I am all alone

And now you are here and I've found a whole new world

Has opened for me

A world filled with joy

A world filled with all your love

Eternally

(**) For you say you're mine

You'll love me all the time

Night and day

Come what may, and all of my life

You'll be my own

I just want

Repeat (*)

Repeat (**)
