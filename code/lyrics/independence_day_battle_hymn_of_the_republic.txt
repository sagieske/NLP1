Song:

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; 
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of
Wrath are stored; 
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible
Swift sword; 
His truth is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
His truth is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watchfires of a hundred circling
Camps; 
They have building Him an altar in the evening dews and
Damps; 
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring
Lamps; 
His day is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
His day is marching on.

I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel; 
"As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall
Deal; 
Let the hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel, 
Since God is marching on."

CHORUS
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Since God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call
Retreat; 
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgement
Seat; 
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubliant, 
My feet! 
Our God is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Since God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the
Sea, 
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; 
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, 
While God is marching on.

CHORUS
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory, glory! Hallelujah! 
While God is marching on.
