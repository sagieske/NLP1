Song:

Use me take me home and use me
Press your hands against my body
You'll be my sorrow
We both know it shows
Push me
Make me feel I'm weightless
Running
We well not escape this
Shake this
You'll be addicted
I'll be inflicted.

This is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy
Pour yourself all over
Oh, no time to waste
Lets fall from grace.

Save me
Save me with your kisses
Give me
The angels and their whispered wishes
I wont fall down
My soul is bound.

This is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy
Pour yourself all over
Oh, this is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy
Pour yourself all over
Oh, no time to waste
Lets fall from grace.

Everyone says your bad for my head
But I'm in denial
One look at your face
I'm back in that place
I'm feeling the fire
This is agony, this is agony.

This is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy
Pour yourself all over
Oh, this is agony
But it's still a thrill for me
This could end in tragedy
Pour yourself all over
Oh, no time to waste
Let's fall from grace.
