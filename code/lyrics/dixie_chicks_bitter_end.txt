Song:

The words that you said
They still ring in my head
Don't you know
We say goodbye
With a tear in our eye
Oh, where'd you go

It's alright you can sleep tonight
Knowing you'll always live on in a song

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you be the same when we see you again

Remember the days
When we'd laugh as you played
Who would have known
The water would come and just take you away
Oh, where'd you go

It's not alright
I can't sleep tonight
Knowing you should have played on
On and on

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you forgive me when I see you again

You had a good time
Drinking all of our wine
After the show
We all rode the wave
Of that crazy parade
Oh, where'd you go
What happened to
The ones we knew
As long as I'm the shiniest star
Oh, there you are

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
We'll still be here when you come round again
