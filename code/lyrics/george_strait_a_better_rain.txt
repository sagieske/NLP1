Song:

Baby, what do you say when love comes down on you
Rainin' the blues on you like it's never gonna end on you
And all your dreams like leaves in the gutter go floatin' by
No, baby, I don't know why all God's children cry

I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
And where you go I hope you find out there

A better rain
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky
Lets you know that God's alive

A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again in a better rain

Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
Long after time has erased all the words like razor blades
You'll remember you and me before the flood
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us

I can see you on some stretch of sand
Spinnin' 'round in circles barefoot dancin' in

A better rain
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky
Lets you know that God's alive

A better rain
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again
And be all right again in a better rain

A better rain
That'll leave behind rainbow in the sky
Lets you know that God's alive in a better rain
A better rain, a better rain
A better rain
