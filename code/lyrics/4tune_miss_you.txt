Song:

Miss you
When I close my eyes, 
That's when you're near... 
I kiss you, 
But I know that I'm dreamin'
Girl, it's unfair
And I can't help but cry every night, 
When I'm weak & you're not by my side

Girl I just wanna hold you, in my arms
Think of you each day now we're apart
And I just want things back the way they were
Find a way back to your heart

Without you, 
I don't feel the same
Since you went away... 
I need you
And I just want you back, 
Here with me
And I can't help but cry every night, 
When I'm weak & you're not by my side

And I just wanna hold you, in my arms
Think of you each day now we're apart
And I just want things back the way they were
Find a way back to your heart.

And I just wanna hold you in my arms
Think of you each day now we're apart
And I just want things back the way they were
Find a way back to your heart... 

I miss you...
