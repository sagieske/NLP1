Song:

As far as I can see
All time and circuitry
Is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me
A song

It's/Cos' all
I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me
So long

All I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell (8x)
