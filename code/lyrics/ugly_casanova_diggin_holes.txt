Song:

I wish that you would move to the sun
Cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
And we know that can't be done

I wish that you would cheat with someone
Cause you're like diggin' holes in water
And we know that can't be done

Bravery and stupidity go hand in hand
I guess that makes me the bravest man
I was quick to learn but slow to understand
Well, what can you do

My theories are borrowed from somewhere else
And I never had too many to talk about
But you were real quick, you were quick to point out
Well, that was borrowed too

I wish that you would move to the sun
Cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
And we know that can't be done

I wish that you would cheat with someone
Cause you're like diggin' holes in water
And we know that can't be done

Bravery and stupidity go hand in hand
And I guess that makes me the bravest man
I was quick to learn but slow to understand
Well, what can you do

Rhetoric and smalltalk are marching on
And I probably am the biggest pawn
Cause I was quick to talk and the first to carry on
Well, what can you do

You need a permit if you're gonna build s**t
And you can't get one so nothing gets built
And your house is standing on a foot and a half of silt

I wish that you would move to the sun
Cause you're like diggin' holes in thin air
And we know that can't be done

I wish that you would cheat with someone
Cause you're like diggin' holes in water
And we know that can't be done

Rhetoric and smalltalk are marching on
And I probably am the biggest pawn
Cause I was quick to talk and the first to carry on
Well, what can you do
