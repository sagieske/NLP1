Song:

Just when I thought that I was better
I realized that I don't know what better was
Is it.........
Better than I used to be?
Better for you or for me?
I'd better hurry cause I need a better view of things
I don't know what it is or what I might be coming down with
Don't know where I've been
Don't know where to go
Can't remember all the things that I need to know
All I know is that if I think about it
I'd still rather be me than me be you
And I'm not getting any better
Cause everytime I can't remember what it's for
Is it.........
Better now than yesterday?
Better that I am this way?
I'd better not be so afraid
I bet I shouldn't say
I don't know what it is or what I might be coming down with
Don't know where I've been
Don't know where to go
Can't remember all the things that I need to know
All I know is that if I think about it
I'd still rather be me than me be you
I don't know what it is or what I might be coming down with
I don't know what it is or what I might be coming down with
Don't know where I've been
Don't know where to go
Can't remember all the things that I need to know
All I know is that if I think about it
I'd still rather be me than me be you
Me be you
