Song:

There is nothing I can do
If you leave me here to cry
There is nothing I can do
If you leave me here to cry
Baby my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

I give you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
I give you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

I'm gonna leave it up to you
So long baby goodbye
Yes I'm gonna leave it up to you
So long baby goodbye
Baby my love will follow you
Yes as the years go passing by
