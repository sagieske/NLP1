Song:

[Intro]
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest (x2)
Hosanna in the highest

[Verse 1]
I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing, the people sing

[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest (x2)

[Verse 2]
I see a generation
Rising up to take the place
With selfless faith, with selfless faith
I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees, we're on our knees

[Chorus]
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
[Bridge]
Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
[Repeat the last chorus]
