Song:

Arrivederci Roma, goodbye, goodbye to Rome
City of a million moonlit places
City of a million warm embraces
Where I found the one above the faces far from home

Arriverderci Roma, it's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure, the flame of love keeps burning in her heart

Arriverderci Roma, it's time for us to part
Save the wedding bells for my returning
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning in her heart
