#40 Listener Supported

Tables turned again and you my friend
You and I face each other all time and time again
I know it's sometimes hard, but knowing just
That we will get along until we're old and gray
And huddled up and doubled up we'll sit
And laugh of times were hard
Laugh of times when we thought all of it would end
It all was over, then again
And though all that I know is this way
And to leave you out of life
Oh my friend...
It will be you until the end with me, always
Always...
Ah ah will, always
Yeah ah, yeah ah, yeah
Always
