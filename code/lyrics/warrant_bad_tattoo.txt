Song:

I don't know how you did it but you.
Let yourself in, yeah.
I don't know how you do it but you,
Get under my skin, yeah.

Everything you do
Makes me shake, makes me rattle makes me roll right over
Be careful what you're wishing for
You might get more than you bargained for
I'm stuck on you
Like a bad tattoo
I'm stuck on you
Like a bad tattoo

I've heard an awful lot about you.
You made me real mad.
I've heard an awful lot about you.
I hope it's all true yeah.

Everything you do makes me shake,
Makes me rattle, makes me roll right over
(Ooh) Be careful what you're lookin' for.
You might get more than you bargained for.

I'm suck on you, like a bad tattoo yeah.
I'm stuck on you, like a bad tattoo yeah.

Make me black and blue
I had never wanted you.

Now be careful what you're wishing for
You might get more than you bargained for
I'm stuck on you, like a bad tattoo, yeah.
I'm stuck on you, like a bad tattoo yeah.
I'm stuck on you, like a bad tattoo, yeah.
I'm stuck on you, like a bad tattoo, yeah.
