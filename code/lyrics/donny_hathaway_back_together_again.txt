Song:

Seems we've weathered
Hard times we've been through
In silence I've waited
I missed you (I missed you too)

'Cause you, you and I back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I back together again
Got the world in a spin

It's all come together
Problems we've defeated
And I'm in here, my heart in hand
You take all that I got and you need it, baby

'Cause you, you and I back together again
Got the world in a spin
You, you and I back together
Got the world in a spin

Love will last forever (Forever)
We can make it real (Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never (No, no, never)
We can truly feel (What you feel)
I feel like getting back together

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Younger and wiser
Time has shown the way
We've come full circle
To stay (don't throw it away)

'Cause you, you and I back together again
Got the world in a spin
'Cause you, you and I back together again
Got the world in a spin

Truth is the light
It's the joy that we both share
Make love day and night
It's so easy to do when you care

Love will last forever (Forever)
We can make it real (Got to be real)
Say you'll leave me never (No, no, never)
We can truly feel (What you feel)
I feel like getting back together

Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Back together again

Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Back together again

Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Back together again
