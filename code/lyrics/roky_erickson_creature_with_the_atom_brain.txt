Song:

Creature with the atom brain
Creature with the atom brain
Why is he acting so strange
Do you think he's one of them?

Threw the doll right down
Ripped it's guts off
And threw it on the ground
Creature with the atom brain
Creature with the atom brain

Voiceover:

"I told you I'd come back! Remember Buchanan?"

"But you're not Buchanan!"

"I don't look like him, but I am him.
Don't you recognize the voice Jim?
I promised to see you die, and I will! "

"Hey boss let us in! Boss man, let us in that door!"

"Get in the automobile! Get in the automobile! The automobile!"

No one stitches like that
No one stitches like that
Creature with the atom brain
Creature with the atom brain

Voiceover:

"Today's big story centers around the killing
Of District Attorney Mcgraw, whose body was
Found in his garage, murdered.

Dr. Walker is under the impression that these crimes
Were being perpetrated by dead men charged with atom
Rays, which gives them superhuman strength and makes
Them impervious to bullets.

Well, if you want to believe that story you can. "

Creature with the atom brain
Creature with the atom brain
Why is he acting so strange
Do you think he's one of them?
Creature with the atom brain
