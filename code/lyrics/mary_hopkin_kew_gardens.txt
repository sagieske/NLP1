Song:

The air was cool on lily pools,
Hazy lazy,
And here and there he'd stop to stare
Admiring all the flowers,
Wandering round for hours.

The sun was warm across the lawn
Scented blended
He saw her linger
And With her finger open up a rose,
Standing on tip toes

Suddenly the rain came flurrying,
Sending the two of them scurrying,
Helter skelter for the shelter
And feeling bolder in the big pagoda,
He gently enquired her name,
And they waited till the sunshine came.

Kew gardens

And for a while
The griffin smiled,
Kindly, blindly,
Till the evening bell broke the spell,
And sadly they said goodbye
And one of the griffins cried.

In Kew Gardens.
