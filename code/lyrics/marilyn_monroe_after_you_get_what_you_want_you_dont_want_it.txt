Song:

After you get what you want you don't want it.
If I gave you the moon, you'd grow tired of it soon.
You're like a baby, you want what you want when you want it.
But after you are presented with what you want, you're discontented.
You're always wishing and wanting for something
When you get what you want, you don't want what you get,
And though I sit upon your knee, you'll grow tired of me,
'cause after you get what you want,
You don't want what you wanted at all.
Changeable, you've got a changeable nature,
Always always changing your mind.
There's a longing in your eye hard to satisfy,
And here's the reason why:
'cause after you get what you want you don't want it,
Baby I don't mean to make you blue but you need a talking to,
'cause after you get what you want,
You don't want what you wanted at all.
I know you!
