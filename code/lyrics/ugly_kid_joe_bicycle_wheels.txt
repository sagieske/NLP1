Song:

Life is to be lived on the positive tip
Never lose the ground
You never gonna slip
If you never lose the ground
Always draw the line
Never wear the frown
Shouldve got myself some bicycle wheels
Shouldve got myself some bicycle wheels
Shouldve got myself some bicycle wheels
On the wings of steel
There's dinosaurs in countries
Everyone that I've seen
There's dinosaurs in countries
If you know what I mean
I always keep a watch on the ever changing future
Doing what I want
And you could do what suits you
I said throw your hands in the air
I like to see your armpit hair
Throw your hands in the air
I like to see your armpit hair
Life is to be lived on the positive tip
Ill never lose the ground
You know I'm never gonna slip
Never gonna slip, cause I never lose the ground
Always draw the line
You know I never wear the frown
