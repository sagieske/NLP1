Prodigy---Power Rap [Interlude:]

[Prodigy]
Power raps inside my skull cap like a brick stack, the kid is back
I told y'all ni***z ninety-eight list that
Yo, ninety-nine I piss on rap
Two thousand where your pistols at?
Dunn, we be the men in black fatigue
Thirty-thousand dollar chains that swing
Yo catch me in the street, poppin that bullshit
Catch a fat lip, hoes all over your s**t
Bust guns like, nuts all over your b***h
Yo youse a woman, tell me what the f**k you tryin to do when
You're growlin all over the top, you get chewed when
I touch that s**t, not only that on the concrete
We splash more ni***z than the wavepool did
Check out my new s**t, we blood spill, you still ice grill
Mad cause your clique's s**t is homo, the Mobb stay real
You steady playin the field
N***a you sideline rhyme
Customers complain they can't feel
You cooked up a half-a** meal
It's time for me to catch burn on the wheels of steel
My s**t fills, the appetite of the populace
We could do it via satellites and such
And show the world how that a** get bust
Ever since a little youth, I had this lust
To pick up the motherfuckin pen and just rush
Like morphine beats, through the wires of the eps plus
You get penalized, for tryin to rock with the utmost
Get branded, for bein weak the most, now be ghost
The f**k outta here, with that bullshit you tryin to share
With the planet, you need to be shot rappin
I got sickle cell I feel the pain all year, what's happenin
Fake thug wanna front like they contractin
Numbers on my head, Dunn please, I'm here waitin
You can't touch me, there's no fake love amongst me
There's no fake ni***z that's run with me
Somebody gave y'all the wrong info, I ain't the Kiko
You nympho, put me on to where you breathe at
You 'sposed to taught that b***h much better than that
I dwell, where the rest of my vets is at
From, some to 'Ville to bx and back
To the lab and the dungeon
My house of reresentatives stay starvin, beats thumpin
We unholy, cause there ain't a part missin
My commission, sit at the table like the last supper
F****are.. {*echoes
