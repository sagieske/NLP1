Song:

I've traveled 'round this country
From shore to shining shore
It really made me wonder
The things I heard and saw

I saw the weary farmer
Plowing sod and loam
L heard the auction hammer
Just a-knocking down his home

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the farmer sweated for

I've seen the weary miner
Scrubbing coal dust from his back
I heard his children cryin'
"Got no coal to heat the shack"

But the banks are made of marble
With a guard at every door
And the vaults are stuffed with silver
That the miner sweated for

I've seen my brothers working
Throughout this mighty land
L prayed we'd get together
And together make a stand

Then we might own those banks of marble
With a guard at every door
And we might share those vaults of silver
That we have sweated for
