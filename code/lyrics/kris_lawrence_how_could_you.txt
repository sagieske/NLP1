Song:

How could you capture my heart so easily?
With just one glance, my heart felt so free.
But how could you make me love you with just your face?
I see no one but you, how could you make me smile so genuinely?
With just your voice, my knees weakened suddenly.

Ref
How could you make the darkness seem so bright
With just a touch all wrong seem alright
How could you turn sadness to joy
How could you have control over me
With just one word give you the best of me
How could I have you right here again oh...

How could you make my world just turn around
With just your stand keeps me planted to the ground
But how could you break my heart so easily
Even just your presence, baby, you deprived from me
How could you just walk away, without even having a word to say

Ref
How could you make the darkness seem so bright
With just a touch all wrong seem alright
How could you turn sadness to joy
How could you have control over me
With just one word give you the best of me
How could I have you right here again

Bridge
Yeah... Oh yeah... You can have all that
You hold the key to my heart

With just a touch all wrong seem alright
How could you turn sadness to joy
How could you have control over me
With just one word give you the best of me
How could I have you right here again

Oh...
