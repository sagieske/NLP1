Song:

[Verse:]
I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits,
There were too many goodbyes,
And I can't say that I been so innocent,
Cause I told my share of lies,
But it seems like whenever I get close to her,
Love pushes me away,
But just when I thought my chances were over,
I stared my future in the face.

[Chorus:]
I looked an angel in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi(hi)... Hi(hi)... Hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi

[Verse 2:]
I made a lot of broken promises,
I had no respect for words,
And I thought that I got all that I'm against,
Until I ran into her,
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer,
Now I can't stay away,
And now I feel like all my pain is over,
I stared my future in the face.

[Chorus:]
I looked an angel in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi... Hi... Hi
And I knew it before she said hi

[Young Chris]
[Verse 3:]
I had a feeling before she said hi,
And she told him bye,
My gift from god,
Fallen star from the sky,
Fell in love the first look at her eyes,
?
Doing her wrong she keep doing her own,
Now I'm taking her home little goose and patron,
Lets get it on,
Turn off your phone lets get blown,
In the zone?
?
You without me is like cash without tango,
Forget about the cash life no longer painful,
Look what we came to,

I done changed boo and for that I wanna thank you,

[Chorus:]
I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi... Hi... Hi
And I knew it before she said hi
