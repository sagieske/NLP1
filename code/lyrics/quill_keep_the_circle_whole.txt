Song:

Keep the circle whole
Yeah
Slave/master
Broken man
Man in mind
Merciless room
Trespass
Black
No light on the dark side
Triumph is a sea of flames
In the shadows
Down

Keep the circle whole

Well I am the wizard
I put a spell on you, yeah
I make you do the things I know you would not do
I am the master
You are the master
Nobody needs a wornout soul

Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole
Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole

Inside the fire

I wanna be, yeah
Cause what you get it is exactly what you see
I am disaster
You are disaster
Nobody needs a wornout soul

Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole
Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole

Whole
Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole
Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole
I'm standing tall
I wanna keep the circle whole
Donґt lose control
I wanna keep the circle whole

Keep the circle whole
