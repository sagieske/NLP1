Song:

I need this to get me through
Can't resist, don't want to
Believe it, I know it's true
Can't beat it, don't want to try

(A perfect hell!)

There's more to me than you ever will know
Down here where the rest of us fell
Waste away, nothing left to show
While I'm in this perfect hell!

Obsession has begun
Possessed by destruction
How did I get so low?
Believe me no one knows
Sometimes I can't hold on
And no one can help me

[Chorus:]
Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me)
I don't think I can make it through this
Now it's got a hold of me (Hold of me)
The less I do, the more it makes no sense

I'm walking pollution who's drained by delusions
On the verge of destruction
I cave in to abduction
Thin blood I'm bleeding
My pulse won't stop racing
Just as my heart explodes

No chance that I could win
Too hard to not give in
I just don't feel the same
Cause I'm the one to blame
Sometimes I can't hold on
And no one can help me

[Chorus:]

I need this to be myself
It feels like I need some help
It's too late to save myself
Or it's just in my head!

[Chorus x2]
