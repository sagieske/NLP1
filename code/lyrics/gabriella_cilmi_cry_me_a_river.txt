Song:

You were my Sun,
And you were my Earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
Made other plans
But you didn't think today would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found about him
Babe, there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad

You tell me you love me
Oh, why did you leave me all alone
You tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
And girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
Oh now your bridge just got burned
And now it's your turn, to cry

Well cry me a river (x4)
Yeah, yeah

You know how they say that some things are better left unsaid
But it wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
And all these things people tell me
Keep messing with my head
You should have picked honesty
Then you might not have blown it

Oh you don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out about him
Babe, there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad

You tell me you love me
Oh, why did you leave me all alone
You tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
And girl I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
Oh now your bridge just got burned
And now it's your turn, to cry

Well cry me a river (x8)
Well cry me, cry me
Oh cry me, cry me
Cry me, cry me
Well cry me, cry me

Oh, and don't cry me a river
And don't cry me a river (x3)
