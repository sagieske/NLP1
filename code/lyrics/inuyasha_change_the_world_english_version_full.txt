Song:

I want to change the world
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get that shining love
That you can't wait to know
If you go on to get your goal
It's wonderland!

I felt so worried when I spout all the time
After all, the future's not lost
Because I know that there's nothing that I really want to know.
And that I met you so I could feel
What you should know
I finally find a love
And now I'm really feeling her right
'Cause the matter is gone
This is the way to love you!

I want to change the world!
Walk again, never miss the way
Don't be afraid, I'm with you
And we could fly away
If you could stay with me forever
Change my mind!
Won't get lost if your passion's true
I'm gonna fly with you again
So you could spread your wings
And you could fly with me away
It's wonderland!

Every single thing
The time and the flyin'
Til the day, I won't let you go
You will see that your desire will be granted again
It's just the feeling
You understand the travel life
It won't be to bad to face
And then it probably you will see will not be to heart
If we could walk beside you

I Want To Change The World
Walk again, Fire against the wind
Don't be afraid to be true
Cause now you have to bring
The power of your smile in your face
Change my Mind
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get that shining love
That you can't wait to know
If you go on to get your goal
It's Wonderland!

I Want To Change The World
Walk again, never miss the way
Don't be afraid I'm with you
Now we can fly away
If you could stay with me forever
Change My Mind
Won't get lost if your passion's true
I'm gonna fly with you again
So you could spread your wings
And you will fly away with me away
It's Wonderland!
