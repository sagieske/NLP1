Song:

Well that'll be the day, when you say good-bye
Yes that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause that'll be the day, when I die
Well you give me all your lovin' and your turtle dovin'
A all your hugs and kisses and your money too
Well, you know you love me baby
Still you tell me maybe that someday well I'll be blue
Well that'll be the day, when you say good-bye
Yes that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause that'll be the day, when I die

Well that'll be the day, when you say good-bye
Yes that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause that'll be the day, when I die
Well when cupid shot his dart, he shot it at your heart
So if we ever part then I'll leave you
You sit and hold me and you tell me boldly that someday well I'll be blue
Well that'll be the day, when you say good-bye
Yes that'll be the day, when you make me cry
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie 'cause that'll be the day when I die
Well that'll be the day, that'll be the day, that'll be the day, that'll be the day
