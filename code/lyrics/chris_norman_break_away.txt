Song:

Do you recall when we were back in school
Me and the guys we were really cool
It was a good time
Never cared much for history
Cause we were rebels
We were young and free
We hit the big time
And it was all mine

I get a feeling when I'm looking back
And that's alright
Come on baby won't you take my hand
And we'll dance all night
'Til the morning light

Chorus:
So hey little girl put your red dress on
Got my blue suede shoes and the night is young
Let's take a drive down the avenue

Let me take you back to when our love was new
We're on the freeway,
Baby I'm gonna break away

I was so busy with the things I planned
Every night playing with the band
It was a cool sound
Pretty girls in the pickup van
You gotta get it baby while you can
There was so much around
We were on steady ground

Life was easy baby life was fun
It was a crazy time
Come on baby won't you take my hand
Let your hair hang loose and I'll make you mine

Chorus
