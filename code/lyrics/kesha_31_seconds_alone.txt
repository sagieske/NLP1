Song:

Caught up, I'm drowning
In this crowded sound
I've fallen underneath
So loud it's pounding
All around me
There's no time for you and me

We could be having
The night of our lives

Chorus:
Pull the fire alarm
I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone
Like the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks
In a minute, for 31 seconds alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time out on my own
Pull the fire alarm
I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
(31 seconds alone)

I need more than a pinch of sand
This hour glass is running out now
Much more than your promises
Need some consciousness
To turn this around

We could be having
The night of our lives

Chorus:
Pull the fire alarm

I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone
Like the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks
In a minute, for 31 seconds alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time out on my own
Pull the fire alarm
I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
(31 seconds alone)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
(31 seconds alone)

We could be having
The night of our lives
If only we had
Some time (6x)

Pull the fire alarm
I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone
Like the hands on the clocks
I would change all the locks
In a minute, for 31 seconds alone

Baby I'm tired of running wild
With all this time out on my own
Pull the fire alarm
I would scream there's a bomb
In the building, for 31 seconds alone

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (10x)
