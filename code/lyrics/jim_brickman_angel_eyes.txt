Song:

I am amazed
When I look at you
And see your angel eyes
It's like a dream come true
They are so blue... and I'm so in love with you.

Sometimes it's so hard to believe
That it is time to leave
But never let me go
I love you so... 

You are the love of my life
I'm so glad you're here
You are the love of my life
Put your arms around me
And tell me what you hear

I wish I didn't have to go
But I just want to let you know
That I will always be here
Now please dry that tear
I will never be far
I love you more then my car.

Now all I see is your angel eyes.
They shine just like the sea.
I will never let you go
I'll hold you till it snows.
But you might wanna know
That here comes the snow.

And now as I drive away
The snow is getting really thick
So I turn around and drive
Back to your arms and sing... 

You are the love of my life
I won't let you go
You are the love of my life
Even if it snows
I'll be here till it goes.

And now the day is ending
I wish I could stop the time
But since I can not I must
Give you one last hug and
Look in your eyes
One... last... time.
