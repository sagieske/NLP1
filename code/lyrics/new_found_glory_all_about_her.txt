Song:

Let me practice this before I say it to you
I know it might come out wrong but I want it to
Another chance to fight
Another way to make it right
So forget all of your chances
It's up to you to follow through
Forget the way she was
Cause it's the things she does that make me
Sing about her
She knows I care about her
She said be gentle boy
You show a lack of character
Let me work this out
Before I come back to you
I know you
Sometimes hate the stupid things I do
Another lonely night
Another way to make it right
So forget al of your chances
It's up to you to follow through
Forget the way she was
Cause it's the things she does that make me sing about her
She knows I care about her
She said be gentle boy
You show a lack of character
There is no other way this girl is so all about me
I'm sorry I can't help the way
Cause it's the things she does that make me
Sing about her
She knows I care about her
She said be gentle boy
You show a lack of character.
