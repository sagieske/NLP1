Song:

Everything I know about love I learned from you, from you
And everything I know about pain I learned from you, from you
You were my only, You were my first
You showed me lonely, and you took me in when I was hurt
But the most important thing you ever gave me, 
You was the one that hurt the most

So thankyou for the broken heart, oh yeah
And thankyou for the permanent scar
Cause if it wasn't for you
I might forget, how it feels to let go
And how it feels to get a brand new start
So thankyou for the broken heart

I still remember when you called
And said that he didn't admit anything
How could you expect me to look at you the same way
You were my only but not my last
You showed me lonely, and you made me put you in the past
The most important thing you ever gave me was the one that hurt the most

So thankyou for the broken heart, oh yeah
And thankyou for the permanent scar
Cause if it wasn't for you
I might forget, how it feels to let go
And how it feels to get a brand new start
So thankyou for the broken heart

And everytime I find myself alone in pieces
I find myself I'll just remember when you hurt me and I made it

So thankyou for the broken heart
And thankyou for the permanent scar
Cause if it wasn't for you
I wouldn't be here, With the love of my life all my pain disappear
I've come so far
So thankyou for the broken heart
I thankyou, I thankyou
For the broken heart
Oh yeah oh, Broken heart...
