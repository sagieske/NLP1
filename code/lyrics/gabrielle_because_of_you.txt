Song:

Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby can't you see
Right now you've got me falling
I'm falling there's no stopping no, no
Touching the heart of me
You can paint a picyure in words
You can make me feel I top the world
When you're near I'm never feeling blue
Cause you always know just what to do
Touching the heart of me
Baby it's becase of you
That I do the things I do
Everytime we touch it means so much
And it's all because of you
Baby it's because of you
That I do the things I do
Everytime you're near I have no fear
And it's all because of you
Because you're the best thing in my life
When I'm with you it feels so right
Oh how I miss you when you're gone
Although you're never gone for long
Touching the heart of me
You know just how to cherish me
You know exactly how I feel
With you I'm always feeling fine
So fine you know, you blow my mind
You're touching the heart of me
Should you ever feel the need wanna fly away
I will fight to change your mind
I'll try to make you stay
Touching the heart of me
That's what you do baby can't you see
Right now you've got me falling
I'm falling there's no stopping no, no
