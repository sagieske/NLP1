Song:

I close my eyes and think of you
And I wonder where you are
Oh I tried my best to hide my tears
But they fall everytime I try

'Cause you contantly invade my dreams
And I sigh everytime I miss you kiss

It's never ending
All the memories and yesteryears we've been through together
Why do I feel afar from getting over you
Done all to get away from all the things that reminds me of you
Constantly you
I guess I failed getting over you

So I'm here in my solitude

And I pray for the day I'd be over you
Guess I'll have to this through.

'Cause you contantly invade my dreams
And I sigh everytime I miss you kiss

It's never ending
All the memories and yesteryears weve been through together
Why do I feel afar from getting over you
It's never easy
Done it all to get away from all the things that reminds me of you
Constantly you
I guess I failed getting over you

It's never ending
All the memories and yesteryears weve been through together
Why do I feel afar from getting over you
It's never easy
Done it all to get away from all the things that remind me of you
Constantly you
I guess I failed getting over you
I failed, I failed getting over you
