Song:

If you twist and then turn away again
If you tear yourself in two again
If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would
Let it go
Surrender
Dislocate

If I could throw this lifeless
Lifeline to the wind
I'd leave this heart of clay
See you walk, walk away
Into the night
And through the rain
Into the half-light
And through the flame

If I could through myself
Set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart away
See you walk, walk away
Into the light
And through the day

So let it go
And so to fade away
Let it go
And so to fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm not sleeping

If you should ask then maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colors fly in blue and black
Bruised silken sky and burning flag
Killers crash, collide in bloodshot eyes

If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would
Let it go
Surrender
Desperation
Dislocation
Separation
Condemnation
Revelation
In temptation
Isolation
Desolation
Let it go
And so to fade away
Let it go
And so to fade away
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm not sleeping

So let it go
Surrender
Let it go
Let it go
I'm wide awake...
