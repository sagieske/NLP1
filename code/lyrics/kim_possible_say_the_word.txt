Song:

I'm on it (echo)
I got it
I can do anytihng
Whacha need (echo)
Got ya back (echo)
Just say the word I'm there

When you find your world is cavin' in
You can bet you gonna need a friend
Someone to take those fears away, away, away

Chorus:
Say the word.. Make a call and I'll be there.
Anytime anywhere have you heard? That I'm
All about saving your world. All you have to do is
Say the word
