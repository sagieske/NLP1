Song:

(M - Kusch L -Deris)
I believe what we called a game
Is more than just a handful of pain

I still remember every hour
Every second has been hours
Far away from many burden
We met eyes without a curtain

Headless into a new sensation
Wether brain nor fear of patience
Careless we had a game to play
You crossed my way for twenty days

Why don't you just heal
The yearning that I feel?
Hey, what we called a game
Is more than just a handful of pain

We got the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more
Than just a handful of pain
We got the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more
Than just a handful of pain

We're different colours, diferent nature
Both we weer like pupil and teacher
It's a puzzle with two pieces
Still not done 'cause one still misses

Helpless I go through unknown stages
A chapter of life which has missing pages
Torture not owly phisical
It pains unbound, way way down

Why don't you just heal
The yearning that I feel?
Hey, I believe what we called a game
Is more than just a handful of pain

We got the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more
Than just a handful of pain
We got the wrong ways
Cause I believe it's more
Than just a handful of pain
