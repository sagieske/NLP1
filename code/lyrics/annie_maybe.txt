Song:

Maybe far away,
Or maybe real near by.
He may be pouring her coffee,
She may be straightening his tie.
Maybe in a house,
All hidden by a hill.
She's sitting playing piano,
He's sitting paying a bill.

Betcha they're young.
Betcha they're smart.
Bet they collect things like ashtrays and art.
Betcha they're good.
Why shouldn't they be?
Their one mistake was giving up me.

So, maybe now it's time,
And maybe when I wake.
They'll be there calling me "Baby",
Maybe.

Betcha he reads,
Betcha she sews.
Maybe she's made me a closet of clothes!
Maybe they're strict,
As straight as a line.
Don't really care as long as they're mine!

So, Maybe now this prayer's,
The last one of it's kind.
Won't you please, come get your baby?

Maybe.
