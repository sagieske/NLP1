Song:

Once in a lifetime
Means there’s no second chance
So I believe that you and me
Should grab it while we can

Make it last forever
And never give it back
It’s our turn, and I’m loving where we’re at
Because this moment’s really all we have

Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we’re young
And keep the faith

Everyday from right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand, together we will celebrate
Celebrate, oh, everyday

They say that you should follow
And chase down what you dream
But if you get lost and lose yourself
What does it really mean?

No matter where we’re going
It starts from where we are
There’s more to life when we listen to our hearts
And because of you, I’ve got the strength to start
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we’re young
And keep the faith

Everyday from right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand, together we will celebrate
Oh, everyday

We're taking it back, doing it here together
It’s better like that and stronger now than ever
We’re not gonna lose, ‘cause we get to choose
That’s how it’s gonna be

Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we’re young
And keep the faith, keep the faith

Everyday of our lives
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight
Gonna run while we’re young
And keep the faith

Everyday from right now
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand, together we will celebrate
Everyday, oh, everyday
(Live everyday, love everyday)
Oh, everyday, now now, everyday
(Live everyday, love everyday)
Ooh yeah yeah, I say

Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
