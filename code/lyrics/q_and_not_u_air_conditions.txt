Song:

Come on, where are you?
Why do you tease me?
Why do you tease me?
Come on, where are you?
I'm pleased to meet you.
What can you teach me?
Black kites at night, at night.
They make me nervous,
So very nervous.
Come on where are you now?
It's just to tease you,
It's just to tease you.
Black kites, take flight at night.
They aim to please you.
Take aim and please you.
Red kites, Red kites,
Red, pink on the surface.
Now come on where are you?
Carved in trees.
We've seen it, we've seen it.
Written in leaves.
We've seen it, we've seen it.
Signed in piss.
We've seen it, we've seen it.
Trust me, we've seen it.
We've seen it, we've seen it.
We're searching the pockets out.
It's for recreation,
Just recreation.
It's under the parachutes.
It's recreation,
New recreation.
Death in a pocket size,
Tucked in a pocket while.
Flags out, flags out,
Flags, on every surface.
What's to touch?
What's to see?
We've seen it, we've seen it.
We've seen it.
What's to touch?
What's to see?
We've seen it, we've seen it.
We've seen it.
What's to touch?
What's to see?
What's to smell?
What's to feel?
What's to hear?
What's to taste?
What's to sense?
What's to make?
What's to touch?
What's to see?
What's to smell?
What's to feel?
What's to leave?
What's to take?
What's to count,
If you don't learn our names?
