Song:

Sleep, my child
And peace attend thee
All through the night
Guardian angels
God will send thee
All through the night
Soft the drowsy hours
Are creeping
Hill and dale
In slumber sleeping
I my loving
Vigil keeping
All through the night

While the moon
Her watch is keeping
All through the night
While the weary world
Is sleeping
All through the night
O'er thy spirit
Gently stealing
Visions of delight
Revealing
Breathes a pure
And holy feeling
All through the night

Though I roam
A minstrel lonely
All through the night
My true harp shall
Praise sing only
All through the night
Love's young dream
Alas, is over
Yet my strains of love
Shall hover
Near the presence
Of my lover
All through the night

Hark
A solemn bell is ringing
Clear through the night
Thou, my love
Art heavenward winging
Home through the night
Earthly dust
From off thee shaken
Soul immortal
Shalt thou awaken
With thy last dim
Journey taken
Home through the night
