Song:

Why do we do the things we do
How can we sing when there seems no reason to
How do we smile when there's not much to smile about
When the world is down who are we to stand and shout
They wonder why we do the things we do


It's all because of this
It's all because of this
We've tasted love, tasted hope, tasted holiness
[REPEAT]

And they wonder why, we do the things we do
