Song:

What do you do if you wanna go loo in the English Country Garden?
Pull down your pants
And suffocate the ants in the English Country Garden
Get a little spade and bury what you made in the
English Country Garden
Dig a little hole and fertilize a mole in the English Country Garden
*Reveal your tush and go behind a bush in the English Country Garden
Crouch in the mud and make a loud thud in the English Country
Garden
Make them hold their noses when you duck behind the roses
In the English Country Garden
With a bit of toil you can add to the soil in the English Country
Garden
With 16 toots you can kill off all the roots in the English Country
Garden
With a little squeeze you can murder all the weeds in the English
Country Garden
Do a little poo and the snails can chew in the English Country Garden
Cause a bit of trouble and do it in the rubble in the English Country
Garden
The flowers'll think you're class when you show them all your a**
In the English Country Garden
It's coming out the back, in the paving there's a crack in the English
Country Garden
Dump in the flower bed or maybe in the shed in the English Country
Garden
Look out for the nettles when you're watering the petals in the English
Country Garden
Leaving muddy puddles can get you into trouble in the English Country
Garden
Pooing can be fun in a garden in the sun in the English Country Garden

*Me and my mum made these lines up, but we think it should be in the
