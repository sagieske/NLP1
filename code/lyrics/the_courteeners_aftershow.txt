Song:

The walk home from barbecue is so very long when I'm walkin with you
The sun is coming up, and it is coming to light that me and you were never that tight

And then you stand there with your old boyfriend
And message after message, and you can send, send, send
You know I will definitely ignore them all
You're having a s**t night, well I'm having a ball

You showed your face at the aftershow, how did I know that you would say you will go, it's because you're always listening to him, He's only average looking and a little bit too thin
