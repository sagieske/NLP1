[Hook:]
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Party's over, it ain't over, try to make a bad memory over and over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Party's over, it ain't over, care to find a single piece of me, game over
Hangover, hangover
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Care to find a single piece of me, game over

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Drink 'till you're drunk
Smoke like a broke stove
Don't quit, take flight
I can't remember last night
It's aight, this the life of a superstar
Sci-fi with that boy trooping hard, couping cars
Snoop be hard in the paint
Drink another cup until I fall flat
All lead and then some
1-5-1, done dilly
Really for sure that
I'm throw back intoxicated
Change over, game over, hangover, faded

[Verse 2: psy]
Body s**t Miss
Daecheuhdi itsue
Kqekkori mot chat kketsuh
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe catch a lady by the toe
Ahn yeppuhmyun yeuppuh bo I'll ddaekkaji bbarahbbiribbo

[Pre-hook:]
Drink it up and get sick
Bottom's up, get wasted
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
Oh my God, dammit, there's the f*****g limit
Pour it up, drink it up, live it up, give it up
Badeusioh
But I can't stop
Making bottles pop until the wheels fall off
Badeusioh
And I can't quit
I wake up in the morning do the same s**t
Wake up in the morning do the same s**t

[Hook:]
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Party's over, it ain't over, try to make a bad memory over and over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Party's over, it ain't over, care to find a single piece of me, game over
Hangover, hangover
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over (bend over)
Hangover, hangover, hangover, hangover-over-over
Care to find a single piece of me, game over

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
Waking and baking, shaking the flees
Caking and baking, raking the cheese
Early in the morning in the bathroom on my knees
Tipping and dripping, flipping the flow
Whipping and dripping a drink on the floor
This is the only way that I was taught a long time ago
Seoul, Korea, you'll see a G-a like me-a
Never would there ever be another like he-a
G-A-N-G-S-T-A, nothing left to say
I done smoked my whole day

[Verse 3: Psy]
Baby nareul si humhae, uhsuh nareul sihumhae
Guhsigiga guhsigihani guhsigihago guhsigihae
Nae il eun up da ae-ra (ae-ra)
Moreugatda nae baereul jjaera (jjaera)
Nae il eu naneun ohneul eu nuhreul baekpro molla (molla) ae
