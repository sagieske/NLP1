Song:

I don't want a lot this Christmas there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
You make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is You.

I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
And I don't need to hang my stockings there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day.

And I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
You make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

Whoa I won't ask for much this Christmas I don't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waitin’ underneath the mistletoe
And I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeers click
And I just want you here tonight holding on to me so tight
What more can I do all I want for Christmas is you
You baby

All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me.

Whoa I don't want a lot for Christmas there is just one thing I need
I just want to see baby standing right outside my door
And I just want you for my own more than you could ever know
You make my wish come true all I want for Christmas is
You You baby Whoa
You…All I want for Christmas is you
