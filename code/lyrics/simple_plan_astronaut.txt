Song:

Can anybody hear me? 
Or am I talking to myself? 
My mind is running empty 
In the search for someone else 
Who doesn't look right through me 
It's all just static in my head 
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
Sending SOS from this tiny box 
And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down? (come down) 
Because I'm tired of drifting round and round (and round)
Can I please come down?

I'm deafened by the silence 
Is it something that I've done?
I know that there are millions 
I can't be the only one
Who's so disconnected 
It's so different in my head. 
Can anybody tell me why
I'm lonely like a satellite?

Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
Sending SOS from this tiny box 
And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot
Can I please come down? (come down) 
Because I'm tired of drifting round and round (and round)
Can I please come down?

Now I lie awake and scream
In a zero gravity 
And it's starting to weigh down on me. 
Let's abort this mission now 
Can I please come down?

So tonight I'm calling all astronauts 
All lonely people that the world forgot 
If you hear my voice come pick me up 
Are you out there? 
'Cause you're all I've got! 

And tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
Sending SOS from this tiny box 
And I lost all signal when I lifted up 
Now I'm stuck out here and the world forgot

Cause tonight I'm feeling like an astronaut 
Sending SOS from this tiny box 
To the lonely people that the world forgot
Are you out there? 
Cause you're all I've got! 

Can I please come down? (please please please) 
Cause I'm tired of drifting round and round (I'm tired of drifting round)
Can I please come down? (please please please)
Can I please come down?
Can I please come down?
