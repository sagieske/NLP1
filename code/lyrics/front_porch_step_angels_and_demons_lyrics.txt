Song:

You got two eyes that took me by surprise when you walked by.
I think that I could die a thousand deaths and still turn out just fine
If I could just see your face every day of my life.

Well I see you're sad but we're both sad
And I see you cry and it makes me mad.
I see the good in all your bad
Let's take this shitty life we have
And throw it down the drain and run away.
Just you and I.

Love don't tell us what to do.
It only shows us what we need.
And whenever I'm alone with you
I know I'm where I want to be.

You're the angel that gives me a reason.
I can't begin to count my demons.
Somehow you still keep me dreamin'
Let me know my life has meanin'.
I find that boy that left you bleedin'
Whisper love and you believed him.
I begged and begged for you to leave him.
I swear I'll kill him when I see him.
I love you more than words can say
But I can't take your breath away.
I'll be the prince that saves the day
'cause I'll rub your feet but I'm not your slave.
I thought that you should know
That I'll forever love you so.

Love don't tell us what to do.
It only shows us what we need.
And whenever I'm alone with you
I know I'm where I want to be.

God cuffed the devil 'cause he had my soul.
Cut off his hands and claimed he stole.
The devil sat there bleedin' and cryin' all confused
'cause when I signed that paper to give him his share
Me and Mr. Lucifer were both unaware
That the soul that I sold him alone belonged to you.

And love don't tell us what to do.
It only shows us what we need.
And whenever I'm alone with you
I know I'm where I want to be.
