Song:

Christian: Love is a many splendored thing,
Love lifts us up where we belong, all you need is love.
Satine: Please, don't start that again.

C: All you need is love.
S: A girl has got to eat.

C: All you need is love.
S: Or she'll end up on the streets.

C: All you need is love.
S: Love is just a game.

C: I was made for loving you baby, you were made for loving me.
S: The only way of loving me baby, is to pay a lovely fee.

C: Just one night, give me just one night.
S: There's no way, 'cause you can't pay.

C: In the name of love, one night in the name of love.
S: You crazy fool, I won't give in to you.

C: Don't leave me this way,
I can't survive without your sweet love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way.
S: You'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.

C: I look around me and I see, it isn't so, oh no.
S: Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs.

C: Well what's wrong with that? I'd like to know.
'Cause here I go again!
Love lifts us up where we belong,
Where eagles fly, on a mountain high.
S: Love makes us act like we are fools,
Throw our lives away, for one happy day.

C: We could be heroes! Just for one day.
S: You, you will be mean.

C: No I won't!
S: And I, I'll drink all the time.

C: We should be lovers.
S: We can't do that.

C: We should be lovers, and that's a fact.
S: Though nothing, will keep us together.

C: We could steal time...
Both: Just for one day. We could be heroes, forever and ever.
We could be heroes, forever and ever. We could be heroes...
C: Just because I will always love you.

S: I
Both: Can't help loving you
S: How Wonderful life is
Both: Now you are in the world
