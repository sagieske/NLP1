Song:

Everytime I think I'm closer to the heart..
Of what it means to know just who I am
I think I've finally found a better place to start
But no one ever seems to understand

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, you're not that far

[Chorus:]
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you
I gotta find you you're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you

You're the remedy I'm searchin' hard to find
To fix the puzzle that I see inside
Painting all my dreams the color of your smile
When I find you it will be alright

I need to try to get to where you are
Could it be, you're not that far

[Chorus:]

Been feeling lost, can't find the words to say
Spendin' all my time, stuck in yesterday
Where you are is where I wanna be

Oh next to you.... And you next to me

Oh, I need to find you... Yeah

[Chorus][x2]

Yeah, I gotta find you
