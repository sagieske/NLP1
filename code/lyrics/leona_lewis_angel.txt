Song:

I feel it, you feel it
That this was meant to be.
I know it, you know it
That you were made for me.
We can't deny this any longer
Day by day it's getting stronger.
I want it, you want it
It's what the people want to see.

We're like Romeo and Juliet
Families can't divide us
Like the tallest mountain on the widest sea
Nothing's big enough to hide us.
When we make love it's overwhelming
I just touch the heavens
You're an angel, you're an angel

I said this world, this world.
Could leave us anyday
But my love for you, it will never go away.
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cuz' you are like a dream
For every night I see you there,
I'll swear you are the answer
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel.

So we take it and each moment that I pause
I see it, you see it,
What we have is made of gold
We're so filled with meaning,
Nothing can make us shallow.
So I hold it, and you hold it
The promise of tomorrow.
When we make love it's overwhelming
I just touch the heavens.
You're an angel, you're an angel

And I said this world, this world
Could leave us anyday
But my love for you, it will never go away.
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cuz' you are like a dream
For every night I see you there,
I'll swear you are the answer
You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel.

I don't need three wishes
Oh I just need one
For us to never be finished
For us to never be dumb
When they say it's over
We'll just say I love you
And when they say it's finished
We'll just keep on building.

This world, this world
Could leave us anyday
But my love for you, it will never go away.
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cuz' you are like a dream
For every night I see you there,
I'll swear you are the answer

And I say this world, this world
Could leave us any day
But my love for you, it will never go away.
And I don't wanna go to sleep
Cuz' you were like a dream
For every night I see you there,
I'll swear you are the answer

You're an angel, you're an angel, you're an angel.

Yes you are. You're an angel...
