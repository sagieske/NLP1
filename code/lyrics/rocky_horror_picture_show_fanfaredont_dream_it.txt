Song:

Dr. Frank-N-Furter Whatever happened to Fay Wray?
That delicate satin draped frame
As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry
'Cause I wanted to be dressed just the same
Give yourself over to absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams to treasure forever
Can't you just see it. Whoa ho ho!
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it

Chorus Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it
Don't dream it, be it

Dr. Everett V. Scott Ach! We've got to get out of this trap
Before this decadence saps our wills
I've got to be strong and try to hang on
Or else my mind, may well snap
And my life will be lived
For the thrills

Dr. Frank-N-Furter Don't dream it, be it

Brad Majors It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy

Janet Weiss God bless Lili St. Cyr
