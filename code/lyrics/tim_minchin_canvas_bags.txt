Song:

Take your canvas bags
When you go to the supermarket
Why use plastic bags when you know
You know the world can't take it

Take your canvas bags
When you go to the supermarket, market, market
Don't you use those plastic ones, no, no, no
Don't you know that you'll feel better for it?

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

Break it down!
Take your canvas
Take your canvas
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

All the ladies in the house, c'mon and let me hear you say, "Canvas!"
(Canvas!)
All the fellas in the house, c'mon and let me hear you say, "Bags!"
(Bags!)

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

Just think about the world
And how the world would be fantastic
If we got rid of all the plastic
We just need to get enthusiastic
Organise a competition gymnastic
Or a bag making comp at your school
F**k it, make it interscholastic
Canvas is for everyone
Whether you be rebellious and iconoclastic
Or conservative or ecclesiastic
I don't care if you're loud and bombastic
Or quiet, or virtually monastic
Sober or on the floor spastic
Yoga master or completely inelastic
I'm not trying to be ironic or sarcastic
Do something drastic
To rid the world of plastic

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket

Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
Take your canvas bags
To the supermarket
Blackout!
