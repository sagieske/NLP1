Song:

Do you still remember what you wanted your life to be?
Now look at yourself - what have you become?
A weakened body with a mutilated mind
Once full of dreams, now numb and empty
The dreams you dream are not yours
You lost them long ago
The life you live is a lie
The dreams you had - they died out long before
Don't you fell ashamed
When you look into the mirror
When you think of the chances you've missed
What life could be today
Does it mean the same to you
Or don't you even care?
A life that is not yours
Not until you're dead
Looking for a way out of your chosen monotony
To escape the mechanized ways you live your life
Mechanical feelings, mechanical thoughts
You're a machine covered in flesh and skin
The dreams you dream are not yours
You lost them long ago
The life you live is a lie
The dreams you had - they died out long before
Does it mean the same to you
Or don't you even care?
A life that is not yours
Not until you're dead
