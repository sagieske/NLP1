Song:

Verse 1:
Lying here close beside you
Thinking of times before
Love was a game and love me more
Now I need to feel the rhythm
Coming from deep inside
I wanna know his right and I...

Chorus:
I wanna hear it from my heart
Wanna be sure before I start
And maybe his love is real
And I... I wanna know before I fall
To give all I got
Don't give nothing at all
I wanna hear it from my heart, oh

Verse 2:
Maybe I'm just too cautious
But maybe I need some time
Time to convince this heart of mine, oh... Oh... Oh...
That I can really trust you
(Really trust you)
'Cause I've learned that words can lie
I hear it from your lips but I...

Chorus:
I wanna hear it from my heart
(Hear it from my heart)
Wanna be sure before I start
And maybe his love is real
And I, I, I wanna know before I fall
To give all I got
Don't give nothing at all
I wanna hear it from my heart, oh

Intsrumental (with breakdown):
Mmm... Mmm... Mmm...
Oh, no
I hear it from your lips but I...

Chorus:
I wanna hear it from my heart
(Hear it from my heart)
Wanna be sure before I start
And maybe his love is real
And I, I, I wanna know before I fall
To give all I got
Don't give nothing at all
(Nothing at all)
Before I fall in love, oh

I wanna hear it from my heart
Wanna know where we stand right from the start
Wanna know that his love is real love
I wanna hear it from my heart
(Hear it from my heart)
To give all I got
Don't give nothing at all
(Nothing at all)
I wanna hear it from my heart

(I wanna hear it from my heart)
(Wanna be sure before I start)
Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Baby
I wanna hear it from my heart
