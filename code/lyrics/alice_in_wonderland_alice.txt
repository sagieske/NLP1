Song:

Trippin' out
Spinnin' around
I'm underground
I fell down
I fell do-ay-ay-own

I'm freakin' out
Where am I now?
Upside down and I can't stop me now
I can't stop me no-oo-oo-ow
Ohhhhh-ohhhh

I-I-I-I I'll get by
I-I-I-I I'll survive

When the worlds crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me

I-I-I-I I won't cry

I found myself in Wonderland
Get back on my feet again

Is this real?
Is this pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end

When the worlds crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me

When the worlds crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me

I-I-I-I I'll get by
I-I-I-I I'll survive

When the worlds crashing down
When I fall and hit the ground
I will turn myself around
Don't you try to stop me

I-I-I-I I won't cry
