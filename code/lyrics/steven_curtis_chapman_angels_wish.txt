Song:

Was God smiling
When He spoke the words
That made the world
And did he cry about the flood
And what does God's voice sound like
When He sings, when He's angry
These are just a few things
That the angels have on me
Chorus:
Well, I can't fly
At least not yet
I've got no halo on my head
And I can't even start to picture Heaven's beauty
But I've been shown the Savior's love
The grace of God has raised me up
To show me things the angels long to look into
And I know things
The Angels only wish they knew
I have seen the dark and desperate place
Where sin will take you
I've felt loneliness and shame
And I have watched the blinding light of grace
Come breaking through with a sweetness
Only tasted by the forgiven and redeemed
(repeat chorus)
And someday I'll sit down with my angel friends
Up in Heaven
They'll tell me about creation
And I'll tell them a story of grace
(repeat chorus)
