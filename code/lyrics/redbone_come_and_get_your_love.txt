Song:

Hey (hey) What's the matter with your head? yeah...
Hey (hey) What's the matter with your mind and all your sighing?
And-a ooh-ohh
Hey (hey) Nothin's a matter with your head, baby, find it
Come on and find it
Hell, with it, baby, 'cause you're fine and you're mine
And you look so divine

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Hey (hey) What's the matter with your feel right?
Don't you feel right, baby?
Hey, oh, yeah, get it from the main vine, alright
I said-a find it, find it, darling, love it
If you like it, yeah-eh
Hey (hey) It's your business if you want some
Take some, get it together, baby

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Come and get your love, come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love, come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love, come and get your love
Come and get your love, now
Come and get your love, come and get your love
Come and get your love, now

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Hey (hey) What's the matter with your feel right?
Don't you feel right, baby?
Hey, oh, yeah, get it from the main vine, alright
