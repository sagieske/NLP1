Song:

I will put my life on tape and hide it in a hole in the ground, safe and
Sound.
And if there's nothing left to play it on when life has worn me down, well,
I won't mind.
I will keep the rest on disc and put you at the top of my list, you get the
Gist.
And if there's no room left to store it on when life has torn me down,
Well, I won't mind.

Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come.
Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come.

I will take what I can take and store it in the front of my mind, and hold
Up time.
I will carve myself in stone, and drive you to the end of the road, and put
You on the walls of my home.

I will scrape what I can scrape, and hide it in the back of my mind, and
Carry it around with me while...
While the sand pulls hard on time and kills us for the time of it's life,
Well, I won't mind.

Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come.
Hold me in the air, keep me in the sun, hold me on the line for time to
Come.
