Song:

Turn the wrong way your socks don't change
Your shirt could too but the shoes are strange
Eyes are facing the other way
In backward talk you try to say

You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out
You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out

Living out instead of in
Drinking tea and paraffin
Thinks aloud but don't say a word
It's just my visions blurred

You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out
You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out

Holding head with foot in door
Camouflage or something more
Goes to sleep on waking up
Coffee without a cup

You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out
You're so Inside Out
Inside Out Inside Out Inside Out
