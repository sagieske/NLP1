Song:

Well I started out
Down a dirty road
Started out
All alone

And the sun went down
As I crossed the hill
And the town lit up
The world got still

I'm learning to fly
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing

I'm learning to fly
Around the clouds
But what goes up
Must come down

I'm learning to fly

Well some say life
Will beat you down
Break your heart
Steal your crown

So I've started out
For God knows where
I guess I'll know
When I get there

I'm learning to fly
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing

I'm learning to fly
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing

I'm learning to fly
Around the clouds
But what goes up
Must come down

I'm learning to fly
