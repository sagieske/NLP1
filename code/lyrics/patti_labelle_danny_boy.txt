Song:

With The Bluebelles

Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen
And down the mountainside

The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go
And I must bide

Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
The pipes are calling
From glen to glen and
Even down the mountainside

The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go
And I must abide

But come ye back when
Summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed
And even white with snow

Its' I'll be there in
Sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
I love you so

Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
The pipes are calling
From glen to glen and
Even down the mountainside

The summer's gone
And all the roses falling
It's you, it's you must go
And I must abide

But come ye back when
Summer's in the meadow
And when the valley's hushed
And even white with snow

It's I'll be there in
Sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
I love you so

Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
I love you so
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy
I love you so
