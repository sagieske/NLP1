Song:

Well, a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
To really tame me down.
'Cause if this devil
Had an angel like you
I'd stop my runnin' around.

I'd stay at home
Like a good man should
And never ever make you blue.
'Cause a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do.

Well, I never been one
For steady girls
I've always played the field.
This warning, that warning
Ever other which one
Was just another spin of the wheel.

But when you've walked in
With your big green eyes
And your pretty little dress of blue.
I knew a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do.

--- Instrumental ---

Well, if a devil me
Had an angel like you
I'd change my reputation.
But a devil like me
With a shady past
Ain't got no recommandation.

I give you real love, true love
A whole lotta sweet love
And I make your every dream come true.
Yes, a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do.

Well, a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
To really tame me down.
'Cause if this devil
Had an angel like you
I'd stop my runnin' around.

I'd stay at home
Like a good man should
And never ever make you blue.
'Cause a devil like me
Needs an angel like you
You bet your little hearty do...
