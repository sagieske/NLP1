Song:

Verse 1:

While I'm tryin to think it out,
While I'm tryin to figure it out,
He is working it all out for my good,
Said He would, for my good.

Chorus:

In the midst of all of my trials,
In the midst of all of my burdens,
In the midst of all of my failures,
In the midst, He still is my Savior.

He is working it out, working it out,
Working it out, for my good,
Said He would, for my good.

Verse 2:

I can't look at the things I see,
For they are just temporary,
Still He's working everything out,
For my good, Said He would,
For my good.

Bridge:

All things, working it out
All things
All things, working it out
All things

Repeat Chorus
