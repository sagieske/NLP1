Song:

Seems like forever and time left to spare
When I look out the window
And still you're not there
You're a long time gone
Such a long time gone

Tearing down memories bitter and sweet
Smashing away 'til it's all obsolete
You're a long time gone
Such a long time gone
You're a long time gone

Do I wonder why
Every day that I
Think about you still
And I always will

Did so much for me
Now I think I see
This I do believe
Feels more like a dream

Looked at the weeds in the broken concrete
Before the bulldozers waltzed in and killed the old street
You're a long time gone
Such a long time gone

Door steps that shone in a bright summer sky
Lay shattered and wasted since our last goodbye
You're a long time gone
Such a long time gone
You're a long time gone

Do I wonder why
Every day that I
Think about you still
And I always will

You're a long time gone

Did so much for me
Now I think I see
This I do believe
Feels more like a dream

You're a long time gone

Do I wonder why
You're a long time gone
You never said goodbye
You're a long time gone
