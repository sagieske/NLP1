Young n***a got jungle fever

Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater

And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…

Hey, little n***a, this a two-seater
It can only fit two people
If it ain’t a b***h in a seat next to me
I can almost guarantee you some 9 mm

He clutched s**t and grab some b*****s and some pasta
Tried to kill time drinking Hen, not vodka
Racks in the compact, nine, I'm a boss
I hate to have to break a p***y n***a off proper
Ey, I f****d my teacher for some extra credit
She work at Cheetah late at night to get that extra fetti
Youngest n***a in the club with a smug
Giving hugs to the b*****s in the bathroom
When I’m done showing love I’mma go chop it off
With the pimps and the blacks in the bathroom

Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater

And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…

Done to catch, caught the…we ain’t playing ‘bout the cheddar
And we will feed a n***a shell for the…
I got jungle fever like Spike Lee
Got a n***a feeling like Ice Tea
Pockets full of dead presidents like a gray
Bust a hoe twice my age
My black and white b***h go together
Like a f*****g zebra
I feel like Stevie, I can’t help it, I got jungle fever
Youngest n***a in the club with a smug
Giving hugs to the b*****s in the bathroom
When I’m done showing love I’mma go chop it off
With the pimps and the blacks in the bathroom

Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater
Young n***a got jungle fever
Try to pull a white girl out the clutch heater

And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…
And we ain’t playing ‘bout the money neither
I feed a n***a shell for the…

Young n***a got jungle fever
