Song:

Fascinating new thing
You delight me
And I know you're speaking of me
Fascinating new thing
Get beside me
I want you to love me
I'm surprised that you've never been told before
That you're lovely and you're perfect
And that somebody wants you

Fascinating new thing
The scene makin'
Want a temporary saviour
Fascinating new thing
Don't betray them
By becoming familiar
I'm surprised that you've never been told before
That you're lovely and you're perfect
And that somebody wants you
I'm surprised that you've never been told before
That you're priceless and you're precious
Even when you are not new
