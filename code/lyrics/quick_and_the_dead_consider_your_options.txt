Song:

[Verse]
(Step up or back down)
Just leave me alone
'Cause I won't let you get away
With murder anymore
I'm trying to make you stay
'Cause I won't let you get away
(Sit down and shut up)
Just leave me alone
I think I'm losing sight of what I know
I'm trying to cut you lose
To see the end of you
[Chorus 2x]
Consider your options tonight
Just leave me alone
[Verse]
[Chorus:]
[2x]
Consider your options tonight
'Cause I'm still waiting here (Just leave me alone)
Consider your options tonight
'Cause I'm...
[Chorus:]
You keep falling for me
Keep falling for me
Keep falling for me
Keep falling for me
