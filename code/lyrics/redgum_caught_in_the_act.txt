Song:

Change your name, get a new address
All it takes is gall
Fifty-five bucks a week's no social security at all

It's a form of reprisal, a song of survival
Keep your morals intact
Don't be naive, you're stealing from thieves
It's a matter of tact
Just don't let yourself get caught in the act

Insure your goods with the AMP
Get your house ransacked
Split the cheque and throw a party
When your stuff comes back

It's a form of reprisal, a song of survival
Keep your morals intact
Don't be naive, you're stealing from thieves
It's a matter of tact
Just don't let yourself get caught in the act

Buy a dust coat, have it embroidered
"Ace Removal man"
A Myer's salesman will sign your form
Then help to load your van

It's a form of reprisal, a song of survival
Keep your morals intact
Don't be naive, you're stealing from thieves
It's a matter of tact
Just don't let yourself get caught in the act

Get yourself a delinquent Bankcard
Make it ANZ
Meet your needs and not your greed's
Get yourself ahead

It's a form of reprisal, a song of survival
Keep your morals intact
Don't be naive, you're stealing from thieves
It's a matter of tact
Just don't let yourself get caught in the act
