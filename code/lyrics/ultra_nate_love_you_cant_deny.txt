Song:

Don't think I don't know
About the thoughts going through your mind
Don't think I don't care
About the way you toss and turn at night
I gotta be sure
That were both feeling the same thing
Like never before my love
Don't be afraid

Chorus
I got a love you can't deny
I got love you can't deny
I got a love you can't deny
I got love you can't deny

Everybody everywhere
Wants to feel some kind of love sometimes
But if you can't show you care
Then I guess I'll have to say good bye
I gotta be sure
That were both feeling the same thing
Like never before my love
Don't be afraid

Chorus

Bridge I want it
I need it
Don't fight it
Love you can't deny
