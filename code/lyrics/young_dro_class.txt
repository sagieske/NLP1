Song:

You can't touch this s**t, man
It's like the Holy Grail, baby

Keep playing, I'mma hold your head like a...
Feel short to care
I'mma show a n***a how to do it well
Everything costs, sure
You got money, you're a bad b***h
My bad, I got a b***h on the line
I'mma come back
We're riding all summer
Believe it or not, ni***z this is weepy
Hoes are like my hot wings
I'm ballin', n***a tryin' to find me
I'm going to New York
Hoes in Maui
Money in the wallet
Can anyone stop me?
You can't find a n***a with a tape
And A. K. A to the risk
Now I got your body in the back

You ain't even in the class up
You ain't even in the class up
What the f**k you're saying?
You ain't even in the class up
Hey, you tell them that
Yeah!

You ain't even in the class up
You ain't even in the class up
What the f**k you're saying?
You ain't even in the class up
Hey, you tell them that

Hoes, I like them juicy like...
Even like a cannibal, of course
Like why are we at a horse?
Situation in my hand, that's in my hand
I'm going back to the night like Batman
I eat a b***h up like pet man
I'm so sick with the flow
Catch that!
Please, tell me what's wrong with me
You ni***z are strong as me
Yeah, we're fu***n' with the same b***h
I'm from a band
You n***a... Me?
Sun is about to get viper
She doesn't know nothing
And tell the ni***z that she needs a diper
And I thought': b*****s, here, hy, this is Shorty
Pull a n***a without it's position
I can't call it
What's the n***a you like?

You ain't even in the class up
You ain't even in the class up
You ain't even in the class up
You ain't even in the class up
Hey, you tell them that
