Song:

Lauren
When we were together
We were just strangers
I was just playing around
So I didn't wanna work it out
Yeah, I didn't wanna work it out

Normani
Got something else missing
We were too different
Baby I've been looking back now
I really should've worked it out
Yeah, I really should've worked it out

Dinah
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back, 'cause I

Chorus
Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together

Camila
Watching you wake up
Thinking I had you
I was like I was so dumb
Boy I should've known that you're the one
Yeah, I should've known that you're the one

So if it's not too late

Fifth Harmony
I just wanna know

Normani
It's me baby, we could still run
Because I finally know that you're the one
Yeah, I really know that you're the one

Ally
Because now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back, 'cause I

Chorus
Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together

Camila
And now that you're gone and I sleep alone
I can't help it, I want you back, 'cause I

Chorus
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together

Boy I miss you
Said I really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
Boy I miss you
Said I really, really do
Boy I miss you
You don't understand that we're better together
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
We're better
You know that we're better together
