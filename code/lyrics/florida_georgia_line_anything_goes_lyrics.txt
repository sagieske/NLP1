Song:

Alabama on a Boombox, baby.
‘Bout to get a little Boom-Box, baby.
Let's go!

Y'all better turn this around. Feels good, now.

Big stars breaking out through the indigo
Chilly wind coming in in stereo
Taillights disappearing 'bout a mile or so,
Down the county road.
Phone blowing up “Where you is?”
Baby saying “Baby, let's do this! ”
Rocking in a boat with a [?]
Baby, lift it all, fold back and twist it all.

I'm on the river and mixin' silver smoking up a filter in a 4×4
Girls headin' off to the river yeah,
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more.
I brought the sounds and you brought the body
Only wanna wait and do it up right
Everybody goes with it, everybody knows it,
Anything goes on a Friday night.

Baby, you ain't nothing but a masterpiece
Swayin' and sippin' at those tequilas
Losing yourself in the big, loud beat
Nothing but heat, come on.
Somebody's rocking that Boombox
Everybody hitting that sweet spot
Nobody minding that chit-chat
Even after all I did with all my friends.

I'm on the river and mixin' silver smoking up a filter in a 4×4
Girls headin' off to the river yeah,
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more.
I brought the sounds and you brought the body
Only wanna wait and do it up right
Everybody goes with it, everybody knows it,
Anything goes on a Friday night.

(It's a Friday night. Get your party right.)

Alabama on a boombox, baby
About to give a little boom-dock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride,
Cause anything goes on a Friday night.

Alabama on a boombox, baby
Not to give it boom-dock crazy
Hop on, it's a hell of a ride,
Cause anything goes on a Friday night.

I'm on the river and mixin' silver smoking up a filter in a 4×4
Girls headin' off to the river yeah,
Victoria's Secret ain't a secret no more.
I brought the sounds and you brought the body
Only wanna wait and do it up right
Everybody goes with it, everybody knows it,
Anything goes on a Friday night.

Anything goes on a Friday night.
