Song:

And you can start by saying sorry,
That would be the best,
Would be the first thing to get off your chest.

Cuz I know you found someone new
And the saddest part is
He doesn't mean a thing to you.
You'll give him a test,
And leave him like all the rest.
(Yeah) nothing but a test,
Cuz you know that I'm the best.

Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you.
You will talk to me
But I sure won't talk to you.
Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you
You will come to see
Maybe I was the one for you.

What do you say?
Lets end this song today.
She might be new,
But she is overwhelming compared to you.
But I wish you the best,
I'll bet you regret losing me
After all this stress.
I moved on and so did you
Your misery will not bring me down too.

Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you.
You will talk to me
But I sure won't talk to you.
Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you
You will come to see
Maybe I was the one for you.

Baby, baby...
(Welcome back to this place stay out of town and out of state, I don't ever want to see your face)
Baby baby...
(Welcome back to this place stay out of town and out of state, I don't ever want to see your face)
Baby, baby
(Welcome back to this place stay out of town and out of state, I don't ever want to see your face)
Baby baby
(Welcome back to this place stay out of town and out of state, I don't ever want to see your face)
Good night and good luck to you

Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you.
You will talk to me
But I sure won't talk to you.
Baby baby,
Goodnight and goodbye to you
You will come to see
Maybe I was the one for you.
