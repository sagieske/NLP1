Song:

All the birds are singing in the whisper winds
Everybody's listening
And the sun is shining like today wont end
Nothing here is missing

Looking over looking under looking through
What we find every time we do what we do

And we laugh
And we cry
And we live our lives
And we love and we love and we love
And it comes back to us

We carve into the tree our history of love
With dreams of ever after
We can sit beneath the bows and trace the lines
That add another chapter 

Looking outside looking inside looking away
What we find each and every time you say that you'll stay

And we laugh
And we cry
And we live our lives
And we love and we love and we love
And it comes back to us

In the evening when we turn in
Will you look back with me?

And we laugh
And we cry
And we live our lives
And we love and we love and we love
And it comes back to us
