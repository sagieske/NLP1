Song:

Speeding on the highway, bright lights on the road
Looking for a woman for the night, gonna shoot my load
Rocking and rolling on the mainspring, feeling a smile flash by
Roll her to the left, roll her to the right, get high tonight
Bright lights
Running faster than you
Bright lights
How does it feel to be through?
Fancy 5 a.m. the sun is in the trees again
Coming back to hit the town, gonna kick the hammer down
Speaking in my head, waking up in bed, sweating, shaking with fright
Roll her to the left, roll her to the right tonight
