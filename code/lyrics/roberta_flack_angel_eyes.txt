Song:

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't againin' no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink, and the laugh's, on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here.

I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here.
'Scuse me while I disappear.
