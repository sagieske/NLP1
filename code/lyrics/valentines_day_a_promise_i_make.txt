By Dakota Moon

Girl, you're every breath I take
Oh baby, 
Your love rules every move I make
Oh baby, 
And I know that you can't read my mind
And baby, maybe I

Don't say it as often as I should
But I really want it to be heard
When I say I love you that's for good
You have my word
That day after day after all
I will always be true
That's a promise I make to you

You, you take this heart of mine
And make it better
I need you to
Come and walk with me through this life
Forever
And I know these words are long over due
And baby, maybe I

Don't say it as often as I should
But I really want it to be heard
When I say I love you that's for good
You have my word
That day after day after all
I will always be true
That's a promise I make to you

I may hold you
I may need you
I may want to
And baby, maybe I

Don't say it as often as I should
But I really want it to be heard
When I say I love you that's for good
You have my word
That day after day after all
I will always be true
That's a promise I make to you

A promise I make to you
A promise I make to you
