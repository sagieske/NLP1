Song:

Well they say what you don't know won't hurt youand I believe that it's soso don't tell me that you found someone new to go through life with you
Because I love youmy darling, my dearest I love you
You're the one I want nearest may I love youand I hope that you love me too
I'd rather die thinking you love methan to go on through life without you
And you, with someone new, to go through life with you
Well, because I love you, I love you
My darling, my dearest I love you, I love you
You're the one I want nearest may I love you, I love you
And I hope that you love me tooi'd rather die thinking you love me
Than to go on through life without youand you, with someone new, to go through life with you
