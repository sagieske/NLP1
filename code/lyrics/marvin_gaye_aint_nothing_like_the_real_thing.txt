Song:

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

(Tammi Terrell):
I got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

(Marvin Gaye):
I read your letters when you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

(Both):
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

(Tammi):
I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend but I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

(Both):
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

(Marvin):
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

(Both):
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
