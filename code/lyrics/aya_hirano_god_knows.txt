Song:

Kawaita kokoro de kakenukeru
Gomen ne nani mo dekinakute
Itami wo wakachiau koto sae
Anata wa yurushite kurenai

—èI run past others with a parched heart.
Sorry, I can't do anything.
You won't even let me
Share our pain together.

Muku ni ikiru tame ni furimukazu
Senaka mukete satteshimau
On the lonely rail

To live on without tarnish,
I face your back and head out without looking back
On the lonely rail

Watashi tsuiteiku yo
Donna tsurai sekai no yami no naka de sae
Kitto anata wa kagayaite
Koeru mirai no hate
Yowasa yue ni tamashii kowasarenu you ni
My way kasanaru yo
Ima futari ni God bless...

I will follow you.
No matter how agonizing the world is,
You will shine even in it's darkest corners.
Cross over the end of the future,
My weakness will not shatter my spirit.
My way is overlapping with yours.
For the two of us, God bless...

Todokete atsuku naru omoi wa
Genjitsu tokashite samayou
Aitai kimochi ni riyuu wa nai
Anata e afuredasu Lovin' you

This warming affection that reaches me,
It melts my reality and roams my heart.
I don't need a reason for wanting to meet you,
Just my overflowing feelings, Lovin' you

Semete utsukushii yume dake wo
Egakinagara oikakeyou
For your lonely heart

For now, let's paint a beautiful dream
And chase after
For your lonely heart

Yamete uso wa anata rashikunai yo
Me wo mite kore kara no koto wo hanasou
Watashi kakugo shiteru
Kurai mirai datte
Tsuyoku natte unmei kaerareru kamo ne
My wish kanaetai noni
Subete wa God knows...

Stop it, it's not like you to lie.
Look at my eyes and let's talk about our future.
I am prepared,
Even if the future is bleak,
I might be able to change destiny if I become stronger.
But for my wish to come true,
Everything is God knows...

Anata ga ite watashi ga ite
Hoka no hito wa kieteshimatta
Awai yume no utsukushisa wo egakinagara
Kizuato nazoru

You are here, I am here.
Everyone else has disappeared.
While we paint the beauty of this fleeting dream,
We trace out the lines of our scars.

Dakara watashi tsuiteiku yo
Donna tsurai sekai no yami no naka de sae
Kitto anata wa kagayaite
Koeru mirai no hate
Yowasa yue ni tamashii kowasarenu you ni
My way kasanaru yo
Ima futari ni God bless...

That's why I will follow you.
No matter how agonizing the world is,
You will shine even in it's darkest corners.
Cross over the end of the future,
My weakness will not shatter my spirit.
My way is overlapping with yours.
For the two of us, God bless...
