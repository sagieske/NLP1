Song:

(break)

I asked my love to take a walk
Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our weddingday

[Chorus:]
Darling say that you'll be mine
In our home we'll happy be
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

(break)

I took her by her pretty white hand
I let her down that bank of sand
I pushed her in where she would drown
Lord, I saw her as she floated down

[Chorus:]

Returning home about twelve or one
Thinking "Lord, what a deed I've done?"
I killed the girl I love, you see
Because she would not marry me

[Chorus:]

(break)

The very next day at half past four
The sherrif walked right to my door
And he says "Young man, don't you try to run
You'll pay for this awful crime you've done"

[Chorus:]
