Song:

And now I concede on the night
Of this fifteenth song
Of melancholy, of melancholy
And now I will admit in this fourth line
That I love you, that I love you

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do

Cause tonight I leave my fears behind
Cause tonight I'll be right at your side

The clock on the tv says 8: 39 P. M.
It's the same, it's the same
And in this next line I'll say it all over again
That I love you, that I love you

I don't care what they say
I don't care what they do

Cause tonight I leave my fears behind
Cause tonight I'll be right at your side
Lie down right next to me
Lie down right next to me
And I will never let go, will never let go

I leave my fears behind
Cause tonight I'll be right at your side
Lie down right next to me
Lie down right next to me
And I will never let go, never let go

But still I see the tears from your eyes
Maybe I'm just not the one for you
