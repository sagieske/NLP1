[Verse:]
Listen, we the children of the sun, n***a, shine brighter
He the beatmaker, I’m the rhymewriter
Yo, check your cell, I got it locked like a crime fighter
I scribble legends of the future, I’m the time writer
Walking through the broken pieces
I break bread with gangsters, bankers, bosses
Reach the unspoken speechless
Whole court of the streets, middle finger to my teachers
Flirting with the b*****s in the bleachers
Ooh, what’s new? Heard you been working on some ill s**t
N****s say y’all bringing back that real s**t
That’s right, yo
Let me get my moment, time to put the b*****s on it
When you stacking dollars
Saving money you’se a big component
Me, I’m in it to own it, ain’t fixated on no short s**t
N****s don’t like it, f**k ‘em with a horsedick
Who drop heaters? Of course, Vic
N****s making their music constipated, they force s**t
I let it flow, inhale the weed then let it go, that medical
Grown n****s can’t get into places I already go
My n***a, let it go
You scary otter, I’m Harry Potter
You petty Peter Pettigrew
Ain’t never tripping about a silly hoe
Said listen when I start ripping
But holla if you hear me though
I f**k hoes, eat cheerios
Said she could eat breakfast
But I told her I’d be strizzy with some cereal
Here we go, hold up, hold up
Let me get back, watch your back
In the city where the semi klick klack
Oh, read it, my n***a interview that
Savemoney to the front, get with them or move back
Oh yes, it’s ktd, we in the trap
She said she like the way I rap
Girl you should see me in the sack
Oh, now drop it back low
Swimming in the women like a tadpole
Know a couple hoes be doing mad blow, it’s sad, yo
I put it to the back burner, habitual sack burner
Revolution; Nat Turner
Fast learner and regular cash earner
Trying to turn the game into some different s**t
Spit that s**t reflect the situations that we livin’ with
Tell ‘em something significant, get us out of this deficit
Up from out the depression s**t, off of all of that extra s**t
I ain’t saying that s**t ain’t cool, we just need less of it
This is the New Testament
