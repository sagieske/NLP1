Song:

Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
Got a new way of driving
Come ride in this car with me
I ride so you bring back your memory

We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your (???) clothes in my (???)
We'll ride in the mornin'
Put your (???) clothes in my (???)
I'll ride so even
I swear I won't do harm

Well we'll ride in the mornin'
We'll ride at night
We'll ride pretty baby til we ride just right

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory

Well we'll ride in the mornin'
Ride before day
Ride pretty baby drive the blues away

Come on baby in this car with me
I'll ride you so easy
Bring back your memory
