Song:

Surprise goodbyes and tears unanswered
Promises that fall
Can leave your precious dreams defenseless
Back against the wall

But I will hold them tenderly
Your secrets are a part of me

As long as I have a heart, you've a safe place to dream in
A tree to carve your name in as long as I have a heart
As long as you need a love that time won't take away
Baby, you have it made as long as I have a heart

A hail of dew, can you think your thoughts in?
A garden where they grow
A peaceful place to settle down in
Away from winds that blow

My love will always hold you near
No matter where you go, you're here

As long as I have a heart, you've a safe place to dream in
A tree to carve your name in as long as I have a heart
As long as you need a love that time can't take away
Baby, you have it made as long as I have a heart

Your family ties are tightly sewn
My arms will always be your home

As long as I have a heart, you've a safe place to dream in
A tree to carve your name in as long as I have a heart
As long as you need a love that time won't take away
Baby, you have it made as long as I have a heart
