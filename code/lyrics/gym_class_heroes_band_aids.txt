Song:

Thank you.
You know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue
When I was falling apart
Through all the papercuts
And all the broken hearts
You played the role of superglue
When I was falling apart
Thank you.
You know exactly who you are
Through all the nightmares
And anxiety scares
You played the role of superglue
When I was falling apart
