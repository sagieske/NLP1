Song:

Well she was just 17
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
And I saw her standin' there

Well she looked at me... and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.
She wouldn't dance with another
I'd I saw her standin' there.

Well, my heart went boom,
When I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in mine

Whoah, we danced through the night,
And we held each other tight,
And before too long I fell in love with her.
Now I'll never dance with another
Since I saw her standing there
