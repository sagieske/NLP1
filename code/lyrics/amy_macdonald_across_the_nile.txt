Song:

Wave your flag high above your head, you deserve to smile, celebrate in
Style. 'cause everything that depressed you now is gone.

And eighteen days while the world looked on, you stood your ground, kept
Holding strong. Eighteen days while the world looked on.

Across the Nile there are stars tonight and they shine much brighter than
Before.
Across The Nile there's peace and love tonight and it shows much stronger
Than before.
Much stronger than before.

Free and fair life they said it would be, cross our fingers, wait and see
And dream of a better day. And across the world you've shown them all that
Hope and strength can conquer all. Will we stand together again?

Across the Nile there are stars tonight and they shine much brighter than
Before.
Across The Nile there's peace and love tonight and it shows much stronger
Than before.
Much stronger than before.

Hope and strength can conquer all, you've shown the world how the mighty
Fall. And across the Nile there are stars much brighter than before.
