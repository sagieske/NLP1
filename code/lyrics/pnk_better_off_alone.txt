Song:

The morning is ok if I wake up lying next to you
But mostly of the time you're away
You're probably flirting with another girl
And not even thinking of me

Oh boy oh boy, I look in your eyes
Oh boy oh boy, and I realize
Oh boy oh boy, I look in your eyes
And the morning is alright

But I know that I love you
And I can't let you cheat on me
You're probably gonna say
That I'm too young
But I know what to do
And I'm making this decision
I think I'm better off alone

How can you cheat on a s*** young lady
Who know what to do when you're around
You know that I'm against it
And hate it when you leave me
But I love you too bits
But I'm not up for it

Oh boy oh boy, I look in your eyes
Oh boy oh boy, and I realize
Oh boy oh boy, I look in your eyes
And the morning is alright

But I know that I love you
And I can't let you cheat on me
You're probably gonna say
That I'm too young
But I know what to do
And I'm making this decision
I think I'm better off alone

When you say that you'll be home for 10 pm
That don't mean in my eyes 7 am
You I'd like to know which bar you've been at
But I know you'll never tell me 'cause you got no respect
You're too lazy too get your butt off my parents couch
But then I say you wanna beer, you always up for that
You always just can't get enough
And think you can handle it with just one touch
But now I better let you know
That I'm better off alone
So please think again,
Because this is the end!

But I know that I love you
And I can't let you cheat on me
You're probably gonna say
That I'm too young
But I know what to do
And I'm making this decision
I think I'm better off alone

But I know that I love you
And I can't let you cheat on me
You're probably gonna say
That I'm too young
But I know what to do
And I'm making this decision
I think I'm better off alone
