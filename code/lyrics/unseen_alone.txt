Song:

Not gunna explain myself to the likes of you
Tired of feeling sorry for feeling the way I do
I've learned that you can please everybody on this Earth
So from now on I'm putting myself first!

Doing what you know to be right, fuck everybody else
Doing what you feel to be right, you only got yourself

Never turn your back on friends that are true
Sooner or later it comes down to you
Stand up for yourself and what you believe
As long as you're true to yourself, there's nothing you can't achieve!

There comes a time when you may find yourself down and beaten
NO HOPE, NO FUTURE, total utter abandon
But you got to take control, rise up out of nothing
Only you can help yourself, your strength comes from within
Have pride in nothing, 'cause nothing is sacred
