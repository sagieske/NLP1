Song:

Yeah

So sorry, lady.
So sorry now.
I've killed your baby.
I don't know how.

So sorry, so sorry now.
So sorry, so sorry now.

So sorry, so sorry now.
So sorry, so sorry now.

You-so sorry mister. (oh-oh, oh-oh)
But don't look now (oh-oh)
I've got your sister (oh-oh)
I shot her down.

So sorry, so sorry now.
So sorry, so sorry now.

'cause I'm a bad man, I do what I can.
I'm a bad man, I do what I can.
I'm a bad man, I do what I can.
All hail me.

So sorry mother
I've let you down
I'm soaked in blood here
I can't get out.

So sorry, so sorry now.
So sorry, so sorry now.
So sorry, so sorry now.

'cause I'm a bad man, I do what I can.
I'm a bad man, I do what I can.
All hail me.

Ha, ha, ha, all hail me.
(oh, I'm melting)
(melt your baby)
(that did not work so very well) or (that did not hurt so bad...)
