Song:

Mmm any given time He'll be there
I don't really have to say no more
Mmm any given time He's right here
Embedded in my living soul - oh for sure
Oh any given time I see
The beauty that has always been
In any given time

I swear by The Lord of the moon split in 2
5 o'clock in the morning, I be calling You

I'm totally lost with out Your light
I'm finding my self on the strive all the time
Not a single day goes by

I'm out to fight the devil but never fought myself
Read a thousand books but never read myself
My souls starving it needs to be fed lord I need your help
Hell with the devil my biggest enemy's myself
It makes me wonder am I doing this for the right reasons
I mean the money the fame and game all sounds appealing
Instead of entertaining I prefer to enlighten
But then again who am I to be in a position
To represent a whole generation of kids and to make them believe
When till this day I still struggle to uphold my deen
I read a 100 God is great in less then a minute
And though my tongue is fast like twista
My hearts not in it

Mmm any given time He'll be there
I don't really have to say no more
Mmm any given time He's right here
Embedded in my living soul - oh for sure
Oh any given time I see
The beauty that has always been
In any given time

By the one in whose hands my soul is there is no match
To think a spider couldn't? Weave a curtain just like that (break)

I wouldn't be here without Your light
I'm finding my self on the strive all the time
Not a single day goes by

Sн que tengo fervor, devociуn para dar mi granito de arena
Y mi aspiraciуn mantenerla serena
Yo Tengo buen criterio aunque a veces esta difuso
Yo Tengo mi firmeza de la cual a veces abuso
Yo trato de ser justo, me sobra lealtad
Coraje valentнa, me falta sobriedad
Diferentes situaciуnes, diferentes actitudes
Afectan mi progreso y todas mis virtudes

[Translation]
Sure I have fervour to give my grain of sand
And my aspirations keep them serene
My perception is sound even though it sometimes gets fuzzy
I have my resolution even though I sometimes abuse it
I try to be righteous, I abound in devotion
Courageous irascibility, I lack moderation
Different situations, different attitudes
Hamper my development and all of my virtues

Mmm any given time He'll be there
I don't really have to say no more
Mmm any given time He's right here
Embedded in my living soul - oh for sure
Oh any given time I see
The beauty that has always been
In any given time

Mercy with out boasting
Gifts with out terms
Goodness with out anger
Forgive with out reason
Any given time
I do my best to strive
In Your name I rise
The apple of my eye

Even when I'm not alone
You are closer than the veins in my neck
Even when I'm all alone

Even when I'm in sleep
You are closer than the veins in my neck
Even when I'm in it so deep

Even when I'm all gone
You are closer than the veins in my neck
Even as I'm singin' this song

Even when I'm on a high
You are closer than the veins in my neck
Even when I try to touch the sky

Mmm any given time He'll be there
I don't really have to say no more
Mmm any given time He's right here
Embedded in my living soul - oh for sure
Oh any given time I see
The beauty that has always been
In any given time
