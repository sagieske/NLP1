Song:

You got a feeling
It's gonna turn you around
You can't believe it
But you can't run from the sound

Of the melodies 
Growing inside of you
The harmonies
Chasing you down
So just surrender
Cause it's a part of you now

I see it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden and a song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way you feel 
When you lets stars
Sing you home, home
Sing you home
Hush, cause the stars trying to sing you home

You wanna fake it
But you can't do it alone
So if you face it
Can you do it alone?

Cause the melody growing inside of you
Wants a harmony all of it's own
You think I'm faking
I'm trying to throw you apart

I see it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden and a song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way you feel 
When you lets stars
Sing you home, home
Sing you home
Hush, cause the stars trying to sing you home

It's falling in pieces
The bridge is a lie
You look for a reason
To open your eyes

I see it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden and a song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way you feel 
When you lets stars
Sing you home, home
Sing you home
Hush, cause the stars trying to sing you home 

I see it written on the walls all around you
Something hidden and a song is a stepping stone
Kinda like the way you feel 
When you lets stars
Sing you home, home
Sing you home
Hush, cause the stars trying to sing you home
