Song:

I used to think about immature things
You know like do you love me, do you want me, are you gonna
Call me like you said you would, is this really your real phone number
But you know I'm a man now baby a grown man and I came a long way
And experience taught me one thing... Taught me to hold on to my love

Vs 1
Sometimes I just can't help thinkin livin without you baby see
Sometimes I just can't live cryin about you baby
I'm not worried bout a doggone thing, I'll take anything you brang
Although I love the sunshine, I still accept the rain.
Cause when I'm in my lonely mood and I just can't be with you
I tried everything that I can find in my mind, but there is no substitute
Thinkin all that life would be when you not around
I just could not find my way, I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I had you in my life all things could be found strong and true
All coming from you... You
Chorus
I call your name girl
Whenever I am lonely baby
I call your name
When I feel the need of love
I think of you.. It eases the pain
Take away the strain

Vs2
I don't worry what my people say in my life today
Althought they try to say you not the one for me
I love you anyway
Cause their intentions might be cool if what they say was true
But there's more to you than they can ever see
And they don't even know you

Thinkin all that life would be when you not around
I just could not find my way I wouldn't even know up from down
Since I had you in my life all things could be found strong and true
Coming from you.. You

Repeat chorus twice

Sometimes I get lonely baby.. I just can't seem to help myself
For not wanting to be alone so I call your name I call your name

I do you do birds and bees do too I love you and you love me
And I know wooowooowooo I call your name and it eases the pain
See I just don't feel all by myself tonight
Seem like someone else is out there oh thinkin of holding somone else tight
So you know where I'm coming from... Oh when I'm lonely when I'm discouraged
I I call your name
There is no substitute for you
No one could take your place, youre more than they can ever see
That's why I call your name

Repeat chorus

Da da da de da la la la

I do you do birds and bees do too I love you and you love me and I know
Woo woo woo wooo
