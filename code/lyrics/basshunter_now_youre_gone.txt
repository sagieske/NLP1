Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With you're pictures hanging on the wall

Are you ready

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
Is this the way it was meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy now you're gone

Ready for takeoff

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it could break apart
It wont heal it never fades away
I'll go crazy now you're gone

Now you're gone
I realize my love for you was strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall

Is this the way it's meant to be
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll go crazy now you're gone
