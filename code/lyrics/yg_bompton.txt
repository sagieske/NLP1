Song:

[Verse:]
N***a, I'm from Bompton
Talking that s**t n***a get yo' a** boobopped-like-boowop
Pop-pop, that's two shots
My shooters in the hood going ham, they need to woosa
N****s ain't beefing with a hamburger
I'm on Rosecrans n***a at Tam's Burgers
I'm buying ak's and handguns
Through the enemies foul, n***a; and-1
I'm really with the s**t though
I'm really on the block with a pistol
Let it blow like a whistle
Yo' mom's looking like she do crystal
I'm a hundred rack boy
But daddy is a b***h and you a son of that boy

[Hook:]
N***a I'm from Bompton
That's why yo' b***h wanna f**k
And yo' homies don't like me cause they know where I'm from
N***a I'm from Bompton
I be really in the hood though
Mama never understood though
N***a I'm from Bompton
New s**t dropping, whip copping, n***a I'm popping
N***a I'm from Bompton
Where the Crips say, "errrb"
And the b***h n****s get on my nerves

[Verse 2:]
I'm buying choppers like tennis shoes
And I hate doing interviews
Cause criminals don't like talking
I don't go to funerals, I don't like coffins
You wasn't catching fades in the county
N****s told you "roll it up" and you was out it
I got Crips they be tg'd up
I heard you hit the county and be pcâ€™d up
Your b***h f**k me cause I'm poppin'
I be on the block when the police watching
And if you cross the street, there's a store there
But that's the enemy store we don't go there
N***a I'm from Bompton
I know ese's and all my enemies b*****s wanna s** me
All my yg's give it up, enemies hit 'em up
West side Tree Top gang, we don't give a f**k

[Hook:]
