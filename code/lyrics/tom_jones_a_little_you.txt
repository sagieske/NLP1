Song:

There's a little truth in
Every lie you tell me
A little good in all the bad
You do....yesss
So instead of running away
Why don't you listen
When I say
All I want is just a little you

I've been wanting you to say
The words, I love you
A little love is gonna make
All my dreams come true...ohhh...
So instead of running away
Why don't you listen to me
When I say
All I want is just a little you

Ooh, there's nothing in this
World I couldn't do
If you would only say
You love me true
'Cause, baby, all I want is
A little you
Through the day and through
The nighttime too
Just a little you.....

There's a little truth in every
Little lie that you tell me
A little good in all the bad
You do, yes
Instead of running away
Why don't you listen to me
When I say
That all I want is just a little you
Ohhhh, child,
I said all I want
Is just a little you...........
