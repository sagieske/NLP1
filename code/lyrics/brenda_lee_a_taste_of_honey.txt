Song:

(Bobby Scott - Ric Marlow)

Winds may blow over the icy seas
I'll take with me, the warmth of the year
A taste of honey, a taste much sweeter than wine
I will return, I will return

I'll come back for the honey and you
I'll leave behind, I'll leave behind my heart to wed
And make it 'er, remind you of a taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine
I will return, I said I'll return,

I'll come back for the honey and you
She ne'er came back to her love so fair
And so he died dreaming of her kiss
Her kiss of honey, a taste more bitter than wine
I will return, oh I return

I'll come back for the honey and you
I'll come back for the honey and you
