Song:

I'm a driver in the race
Power speed for first place
I'm a striver for wealth and fame
I'm the master of my game
To each his own I heard one say
But all would be mine if I had my way
I'm a liar to think I'd win
All kings before me lost in the end
Less of me and all I'm trying to be
Building my kingdom just to find it so
Short of Your Glory
I'm a traitor dressed up in pride
Constructing life on compromise
Manipulator  I'll change your mind!
Intent to finish all I design
I'll use my friends  I've lost a few
Small price to pay  can't wait for you
I'm a deceiver bound up in chains
Painting my face to hide my pain
God save me!
I'm a submitter  forfeit my rule
In the eyes of the world I'm a fool
I'm a quitter from serving myself
And bearing fruit that rots on the shelf
I'm a follower  old ways denied
Took up the cross  I'm crucified
I'm now a vessel where Jesus Lives
There's nothin' to lose
I had nothing to give
Less of me the key to my release
Surrender this life to you
