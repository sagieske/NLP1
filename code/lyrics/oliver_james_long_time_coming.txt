Song:

Everybody wants to be loved
Every once in a while
We all need someone to hold onto
Just like a helpless child, yeah
Can you whisper in my ear
Let me know it's alright

It's been a long time coming
Down this road
And now I know
What I've been waitin' for
And like a lonely highway
I'm tryin' to get home
Ooo, love's been a long time comin'

You can love for a lifetime
You can love for a day
You can think you've got everything
But everything is nothing
When you throw it away, yeah
Then look in my eyes
And I have it all once again

It's been a long time comin'
Down this road
And now I know
What I've been waitin' for
It's like a lonely highway
I'm tryin' to get home
Ooo, love's been a long time comin'

Didn't know I was lost
Til you found me, uh huh
Didn't know I was blind
But now I see

Can you whisper in my ear?
Let me know it's alright

It's been a long time comin'
Down this road
And now I know
What I've been searchin' for
Oooh, been a long long highway
And now I see
Ooo, love's been a long time
Oooh been a long time
Love's been a long time comin'
