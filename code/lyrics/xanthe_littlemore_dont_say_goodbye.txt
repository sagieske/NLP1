Song:

V1) Wish I could do like there's other people doin' tonight
Wish I could say, like other people say they're alright
But I don't want anybody near, 'cause I think they might disappear
And I don't want anyone to say goodbye

V2) There is a town where I used to live as a child
They tore down everything that was growing wild
And I don't like going back home, I hate to see what they've done
'Cause when I do, well, it makes me cry

Ch) Never say goodbye
Can't we give it one more try
Baby never say goodbye

V3) Wish I could think that I'll be fine when you're gone
Wish I could say I'll be fine, I'll carry on
But I wish you were gonna return
And I know you are the one for which I yearn
And I don't want you to ever say goodbye

Ch) So, goodbye
Baby never say goodbye
Can't we give it one more try
Baby never say goodbye

Never say goodbye
