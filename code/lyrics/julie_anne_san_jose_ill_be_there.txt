Song:

First time I laid my eyes on someone like you 
I can't forget the hour, that moment with you 
Then I have realized, love is growing deep inside 
I feel the beating of my heart 

Chorus: 
Coz' every day, every night, I keep looking up the skies 
And I'll pray that someday you will wake up in my arms 
And love will never end 
We belong together, always and forever 
Call my name and I'll be there... 

Spending my days and nights just thinking of you 
How you make me wanna smile with the things that you do 
When will I hear you say, love is coming on your way 
And that you start to feel the same 

Chorus: 
Coz' every day, every night, I keep looking up the skies 
And I'll pray that someday you will wake up in my arms 
And love will never end 
We belong together, always and forever 
Call my name and I'll be there 

Chorus 2: 
Coz' every day, every night, I keep looking up the skies 
And I'll pray that someday you will wake up in my arms 
Coz' every day, every night, I keep looking up the skies 
And I'll pray that someday you will wake up in my arms 
And love will never end 

We belong together, always and forever 
Call my name and I'll be there
