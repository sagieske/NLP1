Song:

I got the
I got them love sick blues ya'll
Man, I can't find my baby
I think she took off with another man
I been around the world looking twice

You know I checked in new york city
On the streets and on the subways
And I looked around that tired town to find the one who loved me
I looked out in the hamptons thought she'd be hangin' with them rich folks
But no she wasn't anywhere hangin' on the east coast

I wish my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I wish my baby come home
I want my baby yeah my baby to come back home
Man you know I love that girl

I checked down to the southern plains from alabama to georgia
Honey if you hear this, please know I'm looking for ya
I checked with all my rebel friends
I've looked around for weeks
And I swear until I find her I won't eat and I won't sleep

I want my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I want my baby come home
I wish my baby yeah my baby would come back home

I went from albuquerque to maine and didn't find a damn thing
So I looked in california - up and down the coast
I looked all over hollywood - it wasn't even close
Never found nothin'
So, I came home, home to detroit city
And there she was sittin' on my porch - my baby looked so pretty

Now my baby's back home
Yea my baby came home
Yea my baby's back home
I'm so happy that my baby is finally home
