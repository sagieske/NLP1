Song:

Ain't got no heart
I ain't got no heart to give away

I said about those fools in love
There ain't no such thing as love
No angels singing up above today

Girl I don't believe
Girl I don't believe in what you say

I say you, you must be mine
I say you, you must be blind
What makes you think that you're so fine?

That I should throw away
The groovy life I lead
Baby what you got yeah
Sure ain't what I need

Girl you better
Girl you better go away

I said that life with you must be
Just not quite the thing for me
Why is it hard to see my way?

Why should I be stuck with you?
It's just not what I want to do
Why should an embrace or two
Make me such a part of you?

I ain't got no heart to give away
