Song:

I've been with you boy
Three years is quite a while
But getting too sensual
Is really not my style

You know I love you
And I like it just like this
And sometimes I feel like
Giving you more than just a kiss...

But baby it's wrong
Baby it's not my kind of game
If I give it to you now
Our love will never be the same

It won't be long
We gotta play our love just right
I know you know the time will come
But baby for tonight...

Let's take it slow (so slow)
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby for you, I'll lay it all on the line

You oughtta know (oughtta know)
Boy I ain't got nowhere to go
I'll give it to you, only to you...
We gotta take it real slow

When we get together
You know I feel the fire
It burns up inside me, oh
That natural desire

I know that you feel it too,
I know you wanna flow
Keep dreamin' about it
And the fire starts to grow

But baby it's wrong
Baby it's not my kind of game
If I give it to you now
Our love will never be the same

It won't be long
We gotta play our love just right
I know you know the time will come
But baby for tonight...

Let's take it slow (so slow)
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby for you, I'll lay it all on the line

You oughtta know (oughtta know)
Boy I ain't got nowhere to go
I'll give it to you, only to you...
We gotta take it real slow

I know tomorrow
It will still be you and me
I'm savin' it all for you
Especially

Trust in me, baby
When I say this to you...
If we wait a little longer
Our love will be forever true

Let's take it slow (so slow)
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby for you, I'll lay it all on the line

You oughtta know (oughtta know)
Boy I ain't got nowhere to go
I'll give it to you, only to you...
We gotta take it real slow
