Song:

I know that we are young,
And I know that you may love me,
But I just can't be with you like this anymore,
Alejandro

She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she wont look at you (won't look at you)
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She got a halo around her finger
Around you

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus:]
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Stop,
Please, just let me go
Alejando
Just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad (just like a dad)
All those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight
Got-cool the bad

You know that I love you boy
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice
At this point I gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus:]
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe
Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Bye Fernando
I'm not you're babe
I'm not you're babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando

[Chorus:]
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not you're babe
I'm not you're babe
Fernando

Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Roberto

Don't wanna touch
Just Smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name
