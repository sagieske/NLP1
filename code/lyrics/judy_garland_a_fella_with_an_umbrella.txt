Song:

I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
I'm just a fella,
A fella with an umbrella,
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.
Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.
So I'll be the fella, the fella with an umbrella,
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.

Judy

For every fella,
Each fella with an umbrella,
There's a girl, a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
For every fella,
Each fella with an umbrella,
There's a time when skies of blue must turn into skies of grey.
Raindrops have brought us together that's what they were meant to do.
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for you.
So, I'll help the fella, the fella with an umbrella,
Help him find the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
