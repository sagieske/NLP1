Song:

("Now you will receive us. We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick. It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil that will be saught by us. With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood 'til it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, to not steal. These are principles, which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
There are varying degrees of evil.
We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption, into our domain.
But if you do you, one day you will look behind you and you will see we three, and on that day, you will reap it.
And we will send you to whatever god you wish.
And shepherds we shall be, for thee my Lord for thee, power hath descended forthfrom thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command.
We shall flow a river forth to thee, and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. ")

I don't care 'bout what all of you say;
Straight Edge is my only way.
Never back down, never sellout:
Drug free 'till the day we die.

They don't give a f**k about us,
When you gonna realize; enough is enough.
It's time to resist and take a stand 'cause drinking doesn't make you tough.
