Song:

If you ever feel alone, I'm right by your side
I'll make you hold
If you ever lose side, I'll be your guide, I'll be your eyes

We can be the light upon the day
When the dark it's starts to break
Be the shelter for the rain

We can be the light upon the day
When the dark it's starts to brake
Be the shelter for the rain

If you falling down I'll be right there to catch you
If you feel alone, you know I got you
If you need somebody that can guide you through
Hand in hand I got you

If you ever feel despair, I'll reach out my hands
No love can compare
And if you ever feel afraid I'll be your straight
I'll be your faith

We can be the light upon the day
When the dark it's starts to break
Be the shelter for the rain

We can be the light upon the day
When the dark it's starts to break
Be the shelter for the rain

If you falling down I'll be right there to catch you
If you feel alone, you know I got you
If you need somebody that can guide you through
Hand in hand I got you

Singing, ooh, ohh, ooh, ohh, ohh, ooh, ohh,
And we all just singing
I'm always stand by you, stand by you
Take my hand, I got you(I got you)

If you falling down I'll be right there to catch you
If you feel alone, you know I got you
If you need somebody that can guid you through
Hand in hand I got you

If you falling down I'll be right there to catch you
If you feel alone, you know I got you
If you need somebody that can guid you through
Hand in hand I got you

If you need somebody that can guid you through
Hand in hand I got you

If you falling down I'll be right there to catch you
If you feel alone, you know I got you
If you need somebody that can guid you through
Hand in hand I got you
