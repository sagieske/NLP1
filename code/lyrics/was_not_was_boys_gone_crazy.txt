Song:

Johnny's on top of the shopping mall
Pretending like he's gonna fall
Just throwing stones at a neon sign
Saying over and over "She was mine all mine"
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time
Can't keep his mind on his schoolwork
Won't tell anybody just how bad he's hurt
Keeps popping them quarters in a pinball game
Doing all he can do to forget her name
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time
Well he sees her face in the dark
And he sees it in the moon
With every beat of his heart
He knows his life is ruined
Out on the highway doing ninety-eight
Radio blasting as he's tempting fate
He swears he saw an angel in a black Corvette
She was blowing him kisses through her cigarette
The boy's gone crazy, it's not just a phase
He's one step over the line
The boy's gone crazy, he's seen his better days
She's really gone for good this time
