Song:

Have they got what they wanted?
Cause they've taken everything
Was it for the money?
Or is political power to blame?
Would you die for your country?
False freedom and liberty
They're lying when they tell us
This is the home of brave and land of the free
Why aren't we against them?
Cause we know that they are wrong
We're the biggest faction
And they've had control too long
Americanism, nationalism, bow to the flagism!
Militaristic, egotistic, high class and capitolistic!
