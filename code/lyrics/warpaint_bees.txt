Song:

Your full moon taunts me

You put me, you put me on yourself
You've been at yourself
You woke me up last night
And my eyes lit up like lights
Like a string of pearls
But you still did what you wanted

And all the time it took you to get your self straight
All that time it took you to get your self straight
All that time it took you to get yourself straight
Was too late
So work harder for the things you made in me

And your full moon taunts me
And your thoughts they got me
Got me in
Got me in

And all the time it took you to get your self straight
All that time it took you to get your self straight
All that time it took you to get yourself straight
Was too late
So work harder for the things you made in me

Did I reset what I started?
Did I resist what I wanted?
Do I think you've got my number?
I'm not the one to continue on.

All that time it took you to get yourself straight
Was too late
So work harder for the things you made in me
