Song:

A blue, black shade of love sent from above
My hands are tied to worlds alone and this I know
Your breath's like wine and just like clouds my skin crawls
It's so divine, the sky it glows with fields of lights

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me, I love you
And on this day, I love you
You make me feel alive and I'll love you
Until the end of time

My hand shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight just like a dove, a peaceful sign
To help us by as you come in, let this begin
Stars fall like dust, our lips will touch, we speak too much

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me, I love you
And on this day, I love you
You make me feel alive and I'll love you
Until the end of time

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me, I love you
And on this day, I love you
You make me feel alive and I'll love you
Until the end of time

I gotta lot to say if you will let me
It's always hard when you're around me
But here right now there's interest in your eyes
So hear me out and hear this the first time

That I love you
Come and lay with me
That I love you
And all this day

And I love you
You make me feel alive
That I love you
â€˜Til the end of time
