Song:

Why is it for every one
There's got to be a greater sum
Of reasons to believe that I need
Because it's easy to forget
And when there's nothing in your head
Soon a sleep is all that I can see

Now I've probably stayed too long
And maybe I could go
But I can't even find a door
And so it goes to the same end
Until the obvious comes and then Acknowledging I've seen this all before

Why do all excuses come
When all I really need is none
Again the instincts they bring back more
But do I think I know too much,
And in the end is that enough

But am I certain what I'm asking for?
