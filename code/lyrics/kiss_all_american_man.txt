Song:

Yeah
Mama told me, "Your lady's lookin' for another man"
I never worry, there ain't a need for me to take no stand
I got my reasons, the things I do are better left unsaid
I'm into pleasin', I do my talkin' with my hands instead
'Cause I can make some time
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine
You're starin' at the band, you want to land
A six foot, hot look, all american man, yeah

I've been to Detroit, I've been to L.A. and I've seen St. Lou
I've had some good times, but I've been waitin' for a girl like you

'Cause I can make some time
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine
You're starin' at the band, you want to land
A six foot, hot look, all american man, yeah
All American man

'Cause I can make some time
You got your ticket and you're lookin' fine
You're starin' at the band, you want to land
A six foot, hot look, all american man, a man

I'm a six foot, hot look, all american man, yeah
