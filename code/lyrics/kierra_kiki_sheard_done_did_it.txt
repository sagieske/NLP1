Song:

If He don't do
Another thang, said
(Already done enough)
If He don't do
Another thang, said He ooo
(Already done enough)
Put food on my table
And clothes on back, said
(Already don't enough)
If He don't do nothin else
I know that He's able cause He's
(Already done enough)
Do do do do
Do do do do

I read in my bible
That two thousand years ago
He laid down His life
Just to save my soul
Now what more can I ask of Him
And what more can He do
I'm already happy
Cause He already came through

Didn't He do it

[Vamp 1:]
Already

[Vamp 2:]
God done did it

(Let me see you clap your hands
If He made it alright for you
Somebody knows like I know
That the Lord will see you through)

[Vamps Again]
