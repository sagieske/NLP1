Song:

Turn on my switch and you will see
It makes me laugh and kiss, so grab me please
I dance, I sing, I am really fun
And any date I'm with is the right one

So if you wanna come, we're gonna have some fun
We'll dance and sing and shout and play, we're gonna lead the way

I am an action man, always a need to party (always a need to party)
Always a need to party (you've got to party honey)
I've got my eye on you (you, you, you, you)

I am an action man, always a need to party (if you want some action baby)
Always a need to party (I'll give you action honey)
So won't you party too

When we step out, you'll have no doubt
This action man knows what it's all about
I'm sure that we will steal the scene
You'll see that I'm just a party machine

So if you wanna come, we're gonna have some fun
We'll dance and sing and shout and play, we're gonna lead the way

I am an action man, always a need to par-arty (always a need to party)
Always a need to party (you've got to party honey)
I've got my eye on you (you, you, you, you)

I am an action man, always a need to party (if you want some action baby)
Always a need to party (I'll give you action baby)
So won't you party too

So if you wanna come, we're gonna have some fun
We dance and sing and shout and play, we're gonna lead the way

I am an action man, always a need to party (always a need to party)
Always a need to party (you've got to party honey)
I've got my eye on you (you, you, you, you)

I am an action man, always a need to party (if you want some action baby)
Always a need to party (I'll give you action baby)
So won't you party too (too, too, too, too)-a
