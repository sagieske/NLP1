Song:

Got a wishbone in my pocket and money to burn
I ain't got no worries ain't got no concerns
The feeling's goin? Through me from my fingers to my toes
'cause my baby loves me he let's ev'ry body know

[Chorus:]

A little bit of love
Goes a long, long way
A little bit of love
Gets you through the day, yeah
A little bit of love
Makes you feel alright
Gets you through the night

Now let me tell you, my heart's so busy jumpin' that it skips a beat
Got me runnin? Round in circles, dancin? In the street
Now, you might think I'm crazy, I don't care
I'm a girl about the town and I'm walking on air

(repeat chorus)

You got me shakin? Down to my knees
Baby don't you stop, I'm beggin? Please, please, please

(repeat chorus)
