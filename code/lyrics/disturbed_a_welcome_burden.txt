Song:

SHOUT!

Heavy! You want it heavy!
Welcome to my world, either way you pick you're winding down
Heavy! I want it heavy!
Welcome to my world, either way you pick you're winding down again

Gather your pathetic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of lie
To another time, to another place
And then they pick a man, (?) tastes my misery
Rip away her disguise and brothel the lies that ya find
The truth is sickening!
We don't need to change it, really
I kind of like it ugly!

Lay it mean! It binding! Seathing! Blinding! Screaming!

Gather your psychotic masses and bring them to me
To a world devoid of sanity
Another time, & another place
And then the violence creates calamity
Rip away her disguise and brothel the lies that ya find
The truth is sickening!
We don't need to change it, really
I kind of like it ugly!

The race of the Mother Culture is thickening!
The rape of the Mother Culture is nearing!
The face of the Mother Culture is sickening!
The rape of a Mother is the loving I need
Bleeding now - 1! 2! 3! 4!
