Song:

(Kim Carnes/Dave Ellingson)

When does a lover ever learn to say goodbye
When does a lover finally stop giving it one more try
If holding you for a night or two
Is all I'm ever gonna see of you
You'd better love me up and on the way back down
Give me somthing I need
Something I ain't found

Just like a bad seed in the wind
You keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind
And you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love and you can break my heart again
Darlin' come on and take my love and you can break my heart again

I see the memories in your eyes do they keep you company
And I hear your temporary sighs callin' out to me
Givin' in is all I do
I give you more and you take it too
If that's the way that it's got to be
Come and take what you need
And take it good from me

Just like a bad seed in the wind
You keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind
And you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love and you can break my heart again
Darlin' come on and take my love and you can break my heart again

Damn that ol' dream that you keep chasin'
So many things that I could have done
But I keep waiting waiting

Just like a bad seed in the wind
You keep blowing back again
When everybody's turned you out I'll take you in
You're a bad seed in the wind
And you've just got to have a friend
Come on and take my love and you can break my heart again
Darlin' come on and take my love and you can break my heart again
