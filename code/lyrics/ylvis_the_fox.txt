Song:

Dog goes woof, cat go meow.
Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeak.
Cow goes moo. Frog goes croak, and the elephant goes toot.
Ducks go quack and fish go blub, and the seal goes OW OW OW.
But there's one sound that no one knows...

WHAT THE FOX SAYS! 

Big blue eyes, pointy nose, chasing mice, and digging holes.
Tiny paws, up the hill, suddenly you're standing still.
Your fur is red, so beautiful, like an angel in disguise.
But if you meet a friendly horse, will you communicate by mo-o-o-o-orse?
... mo-o-o-o-orse?... mo-o-o-o-orse?
How will you speak to that h-o-o-orse?
... h-o-o-orse?... h-o-o-orse?

Somewhere deep in the woods, I know you're hiding.

You say?
You're my guardian angel, hiding in the woods.
