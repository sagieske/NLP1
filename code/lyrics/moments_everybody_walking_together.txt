Song:

When you wake up in the morning
And the sun is shining in your face you feel alright
(Alright. the sun shining in your face. Alright)
Forget about the colours
Living in happiness makes you feel alright
(Alright)

You don't need your eyes let your mind see ( wooo)
There's a better place for you and me

Say Everybody Walking together would be so nice
Everybody Walking together would be so nice

When you read the morning papers
There will be good news to catch your eyes
(Your eyes. There will be good news to catch your eyes)
Let's bring back the feeling
That water from the sky

Just get yourself together, let's take a stand ( wooo)
Make the heart a better place for every man

I say everybody walking together would be so nice
Everybody Walking together would be so nice
Don't run to the jungle and hide from civilization
Streching every problem right here for a better situation
I say everybody walking together would be so nice
Everybody walking together would be so nice
Stretch out, take a stand, everybody walking together
Everybody walking together would be so nice
