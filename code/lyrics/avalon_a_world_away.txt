Song:

I've been walking down this long road simply taking in the view
I've wandered down some wrong roads hit a dead end or two
Before I even take a step
I've gotta learn to forget
I don't know 'bout you, what life has brought you through
But we'll keep walking on, headed home, and see what He will do
We're a world away from where we started
No more looking behind
We can make it if we just hold on
Keep the faith 'cause love's on our side
I point my heart in His direction before I even take a step
I've to learned to follow my affections, walk away from foolish pride
When I think of where we started, look to the end
See the distance is less now than when we began
And It's now I see, I need you right here with me
And we'll keep walking on, head home, if we just believe
We're a world away from where we started
No more looking behind
We can make it if we just hold on
Keep the faith 'cause love's on our side
We're a world away but we're not there yet
There's a whole lot of road up ahead
I want to ride every single mile with you
We're a world away
No more yesterdays, we're a world away
The One who has made a way for you and me
Is the same One who's seen us do everything wrong
But He can make it all right
If we believe it's true
If we say what we say
And do what we do
And hold on the Him
He's gonna see us through.
