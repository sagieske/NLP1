Song:

I gave you all the love I've got,
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I had inside
And you took my love, you took my love
Didn't I tell you what I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I gave all that I've got to
Give baby

I keep crying for you,
I keep trying for you,
There's nothing I, you and I baby
This is no ordinary love
It's no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
It's no ordinary love

When you came my way
You brighten every day
With your sweet smile
With your sweet smile
Didn't I tell you what I believe?
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I gave all that I've got to
Give baby

This is no ordinary love
It's no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
It's no ordinary love

This is no ordinary love
Ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
Ordinary love
