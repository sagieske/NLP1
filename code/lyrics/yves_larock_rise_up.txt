Song:

Eh!

Rise up
Don't you fall down again
Rise up
It's time we break the chains

I tried to fly
No lie
So high
Direction: sky!
I tried to fly
No lie
So high
Up to the sky!

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
Eh...

Rise up
We'll shake it well
Rise up
Makes me feel pain

'Cause I like to fly
No lie
So high
Direction: sky!
'Cause I like to fly
No lie
So high
Up to the sky

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high!

Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Above the rain-
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
For my mind and my brain

I tried to fly
No lie
So high
Up to the sky
Eh!

My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
My dream is to fly
Over the rainbow, so high
Eh!
