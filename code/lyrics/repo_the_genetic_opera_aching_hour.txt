Song:

Mag:
In my aching hour
As I stand to face myself
In this final hour
Bitter fate I accept

This must be my - my aching hour
(This must be my aching hour)
This must be my - my aching hour
(This must be my aching hour)

Tonight I will settle all my debts
Tonight I will sever ties
Tonight I am coming to collect
Tonight I will sing my life

I've made my peace
All debts are paid
At the opera tonight
