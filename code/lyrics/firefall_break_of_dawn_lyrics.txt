Song:

Slip out at night
Melt into the alleyway
Your mind's not right
Not until the next day

Take care
Watch what you're doin'
Be careful that you see
Take care
Stay out of trouble
There's evil out there that you can't see
The break of dawn

What it really wants
Is an unaccompanied girl
He loves his victim hunts
It fills his secret world

Take care
Watch what you're doin'
Be careful that you see
Take care
Stay out of trouble
There's danger out there that you won't see (you won't see)
The break of dawn
The break of dawn
You won't see

(Guitar solo)

He goes home tired
Nobody came his way
But still gets wired
With thoughts of yesterday, yeah

Take care
Watch what you're doin'
Be careful that you see
Take care
Stay out of trouble
There's evil out there that you can't see
The break of dawn

You won't see the break of dawn (repeats until fade)
