Song:

She's pounding on the door
She's crawling on the floor
Oh, she's so coy...

She's scratching on the walls
She's clawing at the gauze
She's so coy...

She's gnawing on the ropes
She's pulling at the hooks
She's so coy...

Oh, you know she wants it
The way that she taunts me
Damn, she's so coy...

It's the Apex Predator
With a sermon for the listener
Seduce & Destroy...

Your head upon a stick
Would look really sick
But they would call me crazy
For the way I spoke to it

I'd ask about it's day
Did it miss me while I was away?

Tight lipped from the stitches
It wouldn't have much to say

The rest would be kept in a
Tight little dress

Propped up in the corner
A perfect little pet

Locked in a box
So I can keep stock
A trophy to show me
That all is not lost

The writing on the wall
A psalm in napalm
Abandon all hope
But try to stay calm

Bleach to clean the curses
I exist, I'm not the first
Tell my mother I love her
I didn't suffer

Photos & fantasies
Virtuoso of crimes scenes
The Apex Predator...

But why does she look so much like me?

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
I gotta satisfy the thirst

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Death is such a flirt

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
You get what you deserve

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Survival of the worst...

It's the Apex Predator...

I'm the boss...

She's got a broken arm
I've got a broken heart
Boy, she's so coy...

She made a little fire
With a fork & electrical wire
Damn, she's so coy...

Blowtorch nightlight
Switchblade knife fights
F**k! She's so coy...

Thunder in the distance
Gun shots or missiles?
My smile is artificial
The lock clicks, my eyes fix

The writing on the wall
A psalm in napalm
Abandon all hope
But try to stay calm

Bleach to clean the curses
I exist, I'm not the first
Tell my mother I love her
I didn't suffer

No regrets, no apologies
A self-fulfilling prophecy
The Apex Predator...

All I could smell was her hair...

... Burning...

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
I gotta satisfy the thirst

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Death is such a flirt

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
You get what you deserve

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Survival of the worst!

But why does she look so much like me?

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
For the wretched & lost...

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
That men had forgot...

Like worms on a hook
That were plucked from the
Heart of the bodies of gods
That were rotting to dust!

The Apex Predator...

All I could smell was her hair...

... Burning...

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
I gotta satisfy the thirst

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Death is such a flirt

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
You get what you deserve

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Survival of the worst...

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
I gotta satisfy the thirst

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Death is such a flirt

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
You get what you deserve

Nobody move, nobody gets hurt
But where's the fun in that
Survival of the worst!

All I could smell was her hair...
All I could smell was her hair...

... Burning...
