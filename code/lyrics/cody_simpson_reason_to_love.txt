Song:

Your heart is a home
I'm never alone with you
When we're together your love is a song
And I sing along with you
There's no one else.

Shining round my stars here
Don't you ever disappear
Baby you're the reason
There's a reason to love

You're the air that keeps me breathing
Stay forever in this street cause
Baby you're the reason
There's a reason to love.

There's nobody like you
And that's why I love you
You're the only one I like
And that's why I love you
The reason to love you.

Look me in the eyes
I never say good bye
Take my hand I need you close to me
I swear I'll never leave baby
Without you I'm incomplete

I... Stars in the night
But you're the sun in my sky
Girl swear you're an angel
That feel down from heaven
And so glad that I'm
So glad that I'm the reason
The reason you love
