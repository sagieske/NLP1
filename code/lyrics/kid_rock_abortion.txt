Song:

My veins are poppin' from this love inside
I just can't let it out
This pipe and these needles are my only guide
They've got me on the wrong route
What is my life about?
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen
And dreamin' like a lonley child
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too
Man I wish you could see them too
Oh lord, oh lord
Man I wish that you could see them too
Man I wish that you could see them too
So can I come to see you sometime?
Cause I've been missin' you
I've never heard you cry
I've never seen you why
I'm feeling oh so young
But still I must die to get to you
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me
And implicate the things I've done
I'm dieing in the shadows of this man I've never seen
I'll see you soon
Now wheres my gun?
Oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord, wheres my gun?
Oh wheres my gun?
Oh lord, wheres my gun?
Oh lord, my gun
Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of
The second coming of christ
Its God himself in a jar
Yeah yeah
Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of
The second coming of christ
Its God himself in a jar
Yeahhhh heyaaaaa
You got me, sad and lonely
But I'm me, me
You know you make me so lonely
I am so lonely
And I will prey and then I'll cry
And I will prey and then I'll cry
And I will prey and then I'll cry
And I will prey and then I'll cry
