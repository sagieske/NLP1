Song:

I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes
Didn't I?

I helped you open out your wings, 
your legs, and many other things
Didn't I?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
The only one who let you go?
The one you hurt so much you cannot bear?

Well we were good, when we were good
When we were not misunderstood

You helped me love, you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive
Didn't you?

I wish that I could say the same
But when you left, you left the blame
Didn't you?

Am I the greatest bastard that you met?
The only one you can't forget?
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?

Or am I just dreaming once again?
Some dreams are better when they end

Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down

We learn to wag and tuck our tails
We learn to win and then to fail
Didn't we?

We learn that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling
Didn't we?

Am I the greatest bastard that you know?
When will we learn to let this go?
We fought so much, we've broken all the charm

But letting go is not the same
As pushing someone else away

So please don't let on
You don't know me
Please don't let on
I'm not here
Please don't let on
You don't love me
'Cause I know you do
I know

That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant
