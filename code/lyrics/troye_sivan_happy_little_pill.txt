Song:

In the crowd, alone
And every second passing, reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds, are ringin' like a drone
Unknown, Unknown

Oh, blazed eyes, empty hearts
Buyin' happy from shopping carts
Nothin' but time to kill
Sippin' love from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills, and

My happy little pill, take me away
Dry my eyes, bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill, take my hunger
But within, numb my skin

Like a rock, afloat
Sweatin' conversations, seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough, I'll take a dip into
The unknown, unknown

Oh, blazed eyes, empty hearts
Buyin' happy from shopping carts
Nothin' but time to kill
Sippin' love from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills, and

My happy little pill, take me away
Dry my eyes, bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill, take my hunger
But within, numb my skin

Blazed eyes, empty hearts
Buyin' happy from shopping carts
Nothin' but time to kill
Sippin' love from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills, and

My happy little pill, take me away
Dry my eyes, bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill, take my hunger
But within, numb my skin
