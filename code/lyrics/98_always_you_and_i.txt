Song:

Oh oh girl

It's so hard to say
How a love could end this way
The one that used to care for you
Just turns and walks away
And it's so hard to find
To leave the pain behind
When all the things you're lookin' for
Your heart can't seem to find

Chorus
I'll be the air that you breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I

Know you're not alone
Without a love to call your own(your own)
Cos I'll always be right there for you
To help you carry on
A heart that's always true(true)
Girl, I'm giving mine to you(you)
And everything you'll ever need
I promise I will do

Chorus
I'll be the air that you breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I

Bridge
Girl, in all your sleepless hours
I will be right there for you(be right there)
With a hand to hold
A heart to see you through(heart to see you through)
Cos each and every night
I will make it right
When life feels so wrong(wrong)
'Cause in my arms is where you belong

Chorus
I'll be the air that you breathe
I'll give the strength that you need
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I

Chorus
I'll be the air that you breathe
I'll give the strength that you need(strength that you need)
I'll be the light in your eyes
When hope becomes hard to see
I'll be your shining star
To guide you wherever you are
And I promise that I'll be by your side
Always you and I
(oh oh girl always you and I)
