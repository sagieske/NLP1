Song:

Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way
It's easy, let it go

Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong
'Cause there's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence
'Cause we are born innocent
Believe me adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

Adia, I thought that we could make it
But I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
A friend who won't betray
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
And show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe that
We are born innocent
Believe me adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter, does it matter?
Believe me Adia, we are still innocent
'Cause we are born innocent
Adia, we are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter, but does it matter?
