Song:

I see Your fingerprints
Your breath of life is the evidence
And I see Your beauty
Your majesty
Surrounding me

[Chorus:]
And I can't deny
Your way to Heaven and I
Can't ignore Your presence in this place.
Your grace is overwhelming and I
Cannot hide all this love inside
I can't deny, I can't deny

I feel Your mercy
Your faithfulness overflowing
And I know Your peace that passes
All of my understanding

[Chorus:]

I can't deny
You're everywhere that I could ever go
I can't deny
You're even in the depths of my soul
Cause I can't deny

[Chorus:]
