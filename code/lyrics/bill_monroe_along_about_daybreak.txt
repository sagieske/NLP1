Song:

When we were young and we thought we loved each other
But you didn't love me I guess
For you've gone and you've found another
Everything to you is regret
This morning along about daybreak
You quarreled at me the whole night through
I know it's not too late for your sake dear
But for me I will always be blue
Oh I'm weary my darling weary
Just to know your love's gone cold
For without you life will be so dreary
We'll need each other when we grow old
Oh sweetheart be good to our babies
And I want you to teach them to pray
Tell them to say a little prayer for their daddy
Where he will be no one can say
