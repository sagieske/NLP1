Song:

If I were a rich man, with a million or two
I'd live in a penthouse in a room with a view
And if I were handsome, it could happen
'Cause dreams do come true

I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
Wouldn't have nothin'

For years I have envied
Your grace and your charm
Everyone loves you, you know
Yes I know, I know, I know

But I must admit it
Big guy you always come through
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

You and me together
That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothin' to me, nothin' to me

Yes, I wouldn't be nothing
If I didn't have you to serve
I'm just a punky little eyeball
With an ugly little optic nerve

Hey, I never told you this but
You know sometimes I get a little blue
Wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Dance with me

I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
I wouldn't know where to go
Wouldn't know what to do
I don't have to say it
'Cause we both know it's true

I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have
I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
