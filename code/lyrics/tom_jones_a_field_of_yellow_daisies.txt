Song:

We met in a field of yellow daisies

Wild and young and free

And she picked a bouquet for me

She loved me... She loved me not

The daisies didn't lie

They knew better than I... She'd go away.. Yeah

But they didn't say why

Have you ever been in a field of yellow daisies

Where the air is warm, pure and sweet

Just as if the world is at your feet

She loved me... She loved me not

The daisies didn't lie

They knew better than I

She'd go away..... Yeah

But they didn't say why

I may fail like petals from a daisy

But for her love I'll always yearn

Each year when yellow daisies return

She loved me... She loved me not

The daisies didn't lie

They knew better than I

She'd go away..... Yeahhhh

But they didn't say why

They didn't say why

They didn't say why

They didn't say why

They didn't say why

They didn't say why

They didn't say why.........
