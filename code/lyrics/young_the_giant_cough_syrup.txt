Song:

Life's too short to even care at all whoah
I"m losing my mind, Losing my mind, Losing control

These fishes in the sea they're staring at me, Whoah
A wet world aches for the beat of a drum, Whaoh

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some forutune that I should have found by now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to go down (Come down)

Life's too short to even care at all, whaoh
I'm coming up now, Coming up now, Out of the blue, oooh
These zombies in the park they're looking for my heart, whaoh
A dark one aches for a splash of the sun, Whaoh
If I could find a way to see this straight I'd run away
To some fortune that I should have found by now
So I run now to the things they say could restore me, restore life,
The way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrop to come down

Life's too short to even care at all whaoh
I'm losing my mind, Losing my mind, Losing control

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that I should have found by now
So I run now to the things they say could restore me,
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down

One more spoon of cough syrup now whaoh
One more spoon of cough syrup now Whaoh
