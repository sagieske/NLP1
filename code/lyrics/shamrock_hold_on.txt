Song:

Hey, lady, how's life been movin' on
I can't deny it now you are gone
This is the first time, can I make it through
Without you now, do the things I used to do

It's getting harder to ease the pain
The feelin' changes, love still remains
I don't know how if I can get this right
Maybe given time, I'll make the most of what I've got

Refrain 1
Is this the price we pay
With all the vict'ries we shared
Faithfully, we've got a reason to go on

I know it's good to be true
Just spend the nights with you
Let me tell you that our love can make it through

Chorus
Hold on, lady, hold on
We've got to go on now
This feelin' so strong

Hold on, lady, hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down the wire

Sweet talkin', it's all in the line
There's no turning back unless you make up your mind
The expectations after all of these years
Risin' to the moment, let's forget all our fears

Refrain 2
Is this the love we have
With all the glories we shared
Faithfully, we've got a reason to go on

I know it's good to be true
Just spend the nights with you
Let me tell you that our love can make it through

[Repeat chorus]

Ad lib

Bridge
And when the night is over
Well, no one can deny it, gotta believe in
We couldn't ask for more than to hold each other tight
It's just we'll never take things for granted

Chorus
Hold on (hold on), lady, hold on
We've got to go on now
This feelin' so strong

Hold on (hold on), lady, hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down the wire

Hold on, lady, hold on (hold on)
We've got to go on now
This feelin' so strong (feelin' so strong)

Hold on, lady, hold on
It's a burning desire
Comin' right down, right down the wire
