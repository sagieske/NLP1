Song:

A fortune made, a goal achieved
But in God's sight, what does it mean?
If I don't glorify Your name
The things I do, I'll do in vain
Oh Lord, to please You
Is what I yearn
Help me remeber this truth I've learned
Chorus
That Kingdoms come and Kingdoms go
But though the Word of God I know
When all in life is done and past
Only what's done for Christ will last
To sacrifice and reach a star
But then lose sight of who You are
Is never worth the price, I know
To gain the world and lose the soul
I know now what You've tried to say, Lord, to me
My spirit can understand
Now, I can see
Repeat Chorus
