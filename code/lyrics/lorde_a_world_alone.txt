Song:

That slow burn wait while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We've both got a million bad habits to kick - not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip, I'm biting my tongue.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

The people are talking, people are talking
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
The people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone.

All my fake friends and all of their noise, complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night.
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks.
The people are talking, people are talking (but not you)
The people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone
We're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're all alone.

I know in our heart everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still (the people are talking, people are talking)
Get still (the people are talking, people are talking)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

The people are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
The people are talking, people are talking

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Raise a glass, cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone.

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're all alone.

The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking
The people are talking, people are talking

Let 'em talk...
