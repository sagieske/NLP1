Song:

You're too young, you're never gonna know why it hit me
When I felt on in silence
No-one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know (x4)

You're too young, you're never gonna know why it hit me
When I felt on in silence
No-one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't

Know oh oh oh (x4)

It's what you get when you try to educate a black sheep
You can't, you won't, you never will
I'm gonna show you what it takes to see the future
It's hard but not impossible

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't

Know oh oh oh (x4)

You think you know oh oh oh
Know oh oh oh
Know oh oh oh
Know oh...

Oh oh, oh ohhhh (repeat)

And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over

And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over, over, over
