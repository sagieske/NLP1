[Hook:]
I know you see me living dreams, turned king from nothing at all
And all the haters at the bottom steady prayin for me to fall
And no! Shawty I ain't worried at all
I ain't worried, I'm certain I ain't hurtin at all
Don't worry bout me cuz I ain't worried bout yall
I ain't worried, I'm certain I ain't hurtin at all
Don't worry bout me cuz I ain't worried bout yall
And no! Shawty I ain't worried at all all all

[Verse:]
Yea, look
I'm a beast dawg,
Turn up the beat dawg
With the flow I'm Mohamed Ali so my style's way out of reach yea dawg
We fly cross ocean water, yall stage housin that sea saw
We ain't really with that back and forth
Chill out with all that sea saw
We stay on top of that charge
Drop hits, drop til we can't drop anymore
She stay on top of the world, poppin, pop til she can't pop anymore
High off stuntin, straight propane
Flames… don't play games
Came in this plane just to hang with the tourists
I ain't in the bull pit, man I ain't with the bullshit

[Hook:]
I know you see me living dreams, turned king from nothing at all
And all the haters at the bottom steady prayin for me to fall
And no! Shawty I ain't worried at all
I ain't worried, I'm certain I ain't hurtin at all
Don't worry bout me cuz I ain't worried bout yall
I ain't worried, I'm certain I ain't hurtin at all
Don't worry bout me cuz I ain't worried bout yall
And no! Shawty I ain't worried at all all all

[Verse:]
Ain't worried bout nothing these munchy n****s talkin bout
Just look at how far we done brought this out
King, be about it bout it
G4 that we so proud of yea
And you see I don't rap my mama problems
Don't even see where my mama be
Engaged in suburbia luxury areas
House so magnificent, vehicles various
Be a blue then hilarious
Offer opinion, we don't know what care would you care
It ain't yo burden to bear
Why? I didn't hear what you care
Carry yo own, what n****s you grown
Ain't worried bout you so please talk about…
