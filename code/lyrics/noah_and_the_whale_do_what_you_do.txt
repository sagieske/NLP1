Song:

There's a pleasure
We must all feel
And it's a pleasure I know
Of losing your heart
And then letting love grow

What can I say
Any simpler
That now is all there is
That you're free to be any person
And you're all that you give

'Cause my bones were made in the womb
And now the brains are leaving my tomb
And every piece will be consumed
By the love my heart endured

But if you do
What you do
Yeah, you'll do fine
Yeah, if you do
What you do
Yeah, well, you'll do fine

Oh, and when love comes a-calling
Don't forget the tune
And when love comes a-calling
Don't forget the tune
And just do what you do

Oh, and the ones who taught you how to live
Oh, they know no more than you
So if you trust what's in your heart
Oh, what better can you do
Than if you do what you do
Yeah, you'll do fine
