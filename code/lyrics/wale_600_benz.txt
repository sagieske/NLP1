600 benz, house 600 grand
That was 6 years ago, whips come from japan
I get that work from my face
I get that work from my face

[Wale]
600 benz, condo 600 grand
I got 12 hundred kicks them straight from japan
My ambition is wicked I put that s**t on my hands

[Rick ross]
I get that work from my face
[Wale]
I put that s**t on my man

[Wale]
Wale, real n-gga, while I tote a blow and bomb haze?
I just tell cj keep on rollin' that's my shorty
Tinted out, you aint seeing through
All black everything, this s**t like a hbcu
Maybach music, major moves
I'm saving major loot
I make my old b***h buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just aint enough, I just seen 33
You only half a w without a second v
Gotta be dreamin, gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20 I had a camry and?
But now I'm ok, I got my s**t together
Rozay told me keep on working, shawty you'll be rich forever, ever
Forever my endeavours and I sever my opponents
I'm cold like it's in denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I just here flossing or? S**t about?

My ambition is wicked I put that s**t on my hands

Dependin' on how I feel, either the coupe or sedan
I'm only dealin' with you, nothing to do with your man
Ruin your plans, it's best to do what you can
I'm up to 600 bricks, started with 200 grams
Hand to hand in the cold
Pockets on hella swole
I was breaking 'em down, now I'm selling 'em whole
Work straight out the kitchen
Aint no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall
I don't do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, but I just came form the mall
I'm on my way to the jeweller bout to cop me a muller
Keep the digital ruler, at arms length of the ruger
Life's a b***h and I feel her
Aint nobody iller, ? Godzilla
Catch me blowing vanilla's
Used to be blood money now it's go hard scrilla
After I count it all up, I'ma go to the dealer and get a...

Hope you heard that intro
This that I been grinding cause I've been saving for that benz flow
So mash on them petty badges
Tell em'? But they never gon catch us
If I am pulled over, I know they gon be on it
Cause it's hot in here and I got no l like the '72 dolphins
Woooh, race my?, and I bet you never pass me like a safety?
I'm polamalu, 600 the newest model
My newest motto to use a condom with newest models
Uhh, got a hundred on the dash uh
Ya aint killers ya'll got hundred yard dash guns
I'm a rare one, camo's and some rare ones
Where I'm from is the circus, hope you don't expect a fair one
Dropping hundreds like it aint nothing
Really it was but you know I never sayin' nothing
