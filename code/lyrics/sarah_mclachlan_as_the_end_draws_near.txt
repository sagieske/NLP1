Song:

Into the valleys,
The shadow of death,
Greifs silently across the darkened sea.

This is it, we stand alone,
We can see it all from here,
The starless night across the mountainside.
No one left to talk to,
There's nothing left to say.

Into the valleys...

You and me, we stand alone,
We can see it all from here,
Stretched far and wide,
The barren skies,
Fighting a silence,
From deep inside.

Into the valleys...

You and me...

Into the valleys,
The shadow of death,
Griefs silently it's in you and me,
It's in you and me...
