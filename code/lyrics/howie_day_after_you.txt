Song:

We'll have our way
And I'm holding your hand
Thinking about the words to say
And I'm thinking about the hands you'll meet
The people that you'll shake
Along the way
Along your way

And we are walking after you
Are you holding on?
We are faltered after you
But you're feeling oh so wrong

We'll have our way with all of you
What is this world coming to?
I am walking
And you still, you're talking
You talk too much
Oh New York City
Had the craze you wanted
Now you're swimming in it
You're swimming in it
Here we are
The fireplace where you left
Isn't lit

And I am walking after you
Are you holding on?
And we are faltered after you
No, cause I feel what's in your blood
I would only call what's in you after all
But you're feeling oh so right

And I am stronger everyday for you..
And I am stronger everyday..

But we both know we feel above this
Are you hanging on?
And we both know we feel above this
But you're feeling oh so wrong

And I am faltered after you
Are you holding on, holding on
And we are walking and faltered after you
We are faltered after you
