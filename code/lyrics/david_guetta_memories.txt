Song:

All the crazy s**t I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me

All the crazy s**t I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah

All the crazy s**t I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me

All the crazy s**t I did tonight
Those would be the best memories
I just wanna let it go for the night
That would be the best therapy for me

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah

It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind

It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind
It's gettin' late but I don't mind

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
