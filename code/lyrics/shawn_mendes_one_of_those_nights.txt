Song:

Time up in the middle of a daydream
Call you up ‘cause the time is wasted
Let's drive we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don't stumble
We can't do this alone

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back, it's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

We're young, live with no fear
Kids running wild, girls crying dove tears
We don't have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Cut up in the night, oh we missed the last train
It's our time and we're leaving home

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back, it's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Go home it's over, but it's not the end
Don't wait ‘til you're older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don't know
One of those nights, we're driving around
And it's pouring us down
One of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Wanna hold on tight to a little of this
Come now you don't want to miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back, it's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights

One of those nights, where she turns those lights down
And it's only us now, one of those nights
