Song:

I don't know what made us lose our way
They said some things we thought we'd never say

Yeahh

It never did come easy
I always fought for what felt right
Coz your the one I want here in my life

Yeahh

Hold on, all the while I was thinking bout now
It's all we're gonna see how this works out

We just need a place where we can hide
To try and find some reason in our lives

Yeahh

You know it never did come easy
I'll keep on doing what feels right
Coz your the one I need here in my life

Yeahh

Hold on, all the while I was thinking bout now
It's all we're gonna see how this works out

Let go of what you fear and
Hold on to what you're losing
Coz I can't do this on my own

No I can't do this on my own

Yeahh

Hold on, all the while I was thinking bout now
It's all we're gonna see how this works out

Let go of what you fear and
Hold on to what you're losing
Coz I can't do this on my own

I see the beauty within
Don't wanna lose you again
Coz that's the pain only you know

Yeahh

All the while I was thinking bout now

Woahhh yeahh

It's all we're gonna see how this works out

Ooooohhh
