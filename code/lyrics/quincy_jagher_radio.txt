Song:

Ai ai ai, ai ai ai
I am then reading all your signal size just no more,
You claim you really want my love I am pulling...
Had me now? You said you gonna give me more than your fault,
I hear these? When you are talking why u'are placing floor
You had in mind, you lost me, such a damned shame, look what you did to me
You leave that replay, it's xxxx to say?

I am not gonna listen girl, I am turning off your radio
Turning off your radio, I can't take no more
How can even knock the door
You got it go,
I won't like this word
When you talk, I ignore, don't wanna argue girl I am turning up your radio,
Don't wann listen coz you are screaming like the radio
Got a dj telling this is for the radio
Telling you are leaving when you hear this on the radio
I am not lying girl I am turing up your radio
I am not fighting for the title girl, winning this war
We play cards, when we make love, wishing this is hard
Let me go, you never give me more than your fault, j
Ust have the radio you talk too much and close the door.
You had in mind, you lost me, such a damned shame,
Look what you said to me, you need that replay, it's xxxx to say?
I am not gonna listen, I am turning off your radio
Turning off your radio, I can't take no more
How can even knock the door
You got it go,
I won't like this word,
When you talk, I ignore, don't wanna argue girl I am turning up your radio,
Don't wann listen coz u'are screaming like the radio
Got a dj telling this is for the radio
Telling me you are leaving when you hear this on the radio
I am not lying girl I am turing up your radio

I lost my heart I am losing time, communicate, don't tell me now
Yeah, you claim what you gave me is real
I am closing the door like it knows how I feel
Turning off your radio, I can't take no more
How can even knock the door
You got it go,
I won't like this word
When you talk, I ignore, don't wanna argue girl I am turning up your radio
Turning off your radio, I can't take no more
How can even knock the door
You got it go,
I won't like this word
When you talk, I ignore, don't wanna argue girl I am turning up your radio
Don't wann listen coz you scream like the radio
Got a dj telling this is for the radio
Telling me you are leaving when you hear this on the radio
I am not lying girl I am turing up your radio
Don't wann listen coz you are screaming like the radio
