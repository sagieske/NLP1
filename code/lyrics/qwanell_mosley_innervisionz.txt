Song:

[Intro:]
The world without a father
Is a world of war, sorrow, and hurt
I wish I had one wish that could bring you back
Cause there are times like this
Where I wanna cry
And ask why
Did you have to go
And leave me
But then I thought you're better off where you are
In Heaven
I love you Daddy

[Verse 1:]
Sometimes I reminisce protecting my life and how different it would be if I had you right with me
Oh I wish you were here with me
I just want you to know no one can take your place and I know you're in heaven smiling down on me and you're so proud of me (I wish)

[Chorus:]
I wish that I can turn back the hands of time
I long for the day that you'll be by my side
These are my innervisionz
I dream of a place with all peace and no war (no poverty)
And you hurt no more
These are my innervisionz (my innervisionz)

[Verse 2:]
I turn on the news
The news I think of you dad
For living with so many issues, yea
I miss you daddy but you're better off where you are
And I'll always be thinking of you
Yes I will always love you

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I long for the day (long for the day)
When I'll see your face (I see your face)
I can't wait to see you daddy

[Chorus:]

It's alright, it's alright [x2]
You don't have to cry no more
No more crying [x2]
My innervisionz
