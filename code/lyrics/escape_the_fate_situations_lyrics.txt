Song:

Situations are irrelevant now
She loves the way that I tease
I love the way that she breathes

I touched her (ooh)
She touched my (ahhh)
It was the craziest thing.

I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me
A certain girl she took my hand and ran it up her thigh
She licked her lips and pulled my hair, I fall in love for a night

She can't behave and I'm just a slave
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion.
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion.

The frustration it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me.
A certain girl she took her hand and put in my lap
"It's way too full", she said. Once you have me you'll always come back.

She can't behave and I'm just a slave
Don't worry, I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion.

I know you love to insist and all it takes is a kiss and you just
Love to hate me.

You know you love all the lies so don't act surprised that I just
Love to hate you.

I kissed your lips you pulled my hair it was the craziest thing
I love the girls who love to hate. (Breathing)

(Whoa) Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion

Darling (Leave Me), what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me (Darling), go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your favorite passion
