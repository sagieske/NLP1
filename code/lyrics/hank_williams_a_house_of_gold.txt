Song:

Chorus
I had rather be in a dark cold grave, and know that my poor soul was saved,
Than to live in this world in a house of gold, and deny my God and doom my soul.

Then he sung these two other verses:

Jesus said come unto me, I'll break sins chains and set you free,
Ill carry you to a home on high, where you'll never never did.

Repeat chorus

Jesus died there on the cross, so this world would not be lost,
Sinner hear now what I say, for someday you'll have to pay.

Repeat chorus
