Song:

From guilt to dust
You think that I don't want to hate you
I know that I never did like you
This is not another passing phase
But I can see your face
But when s**t will finally break me
Persistent in trying to get me
El fuego que quema adentro
Gets to my head

Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say
Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say

You think that you're so much like me
But you will not ever remind me
Of everything that I cannot embrace
But I can see your face
I'm trying to never remember
I'm trying not to point the finger
El fuego que quemo adentro
Gets to my head

Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say
Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say

I think I kind of hate you
I never really liked you
I think I kind of hate you
I never really liked you
This is not a passing phase
I think I kind of hate you
I never really liked you
I think I kind of hate you
I never really liked you
This is not a passing phase

Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say
Stay away
I never want to see your face
Forget my name
There's nothing you can do or say
