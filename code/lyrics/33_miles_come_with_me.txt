Song:

Where's that greener grass you've been looking for
You can't see it anywhere anymore
You've been knockin' down fences just to find it
Seems no matter how hard you try
You can't fill the void you have inside
With anything the world says it enough
You know that it will never be enough

[Chorus:]
Come with me
And I will show you Jesus
And he will give you more than you could ask or imagine
Come with me
If you're lookin' for a Savior
If you lookin' for a friend
I know someone you should meet

So come with me
Come with me

Tired of everyday being just another day
You can't take it anymore anyway
You've done everything in your power
To change it
Seems no matter how much you do
Well all your plans keep falling thru
You need wings to get you off the ground
For everytime the world has let you down

[Chorus:]

I'm not claiming to hold all the answers
But I'm holdin' on to the One who does
Come with me and I will show you Jesus
Come with me

[Chorus:]

So come with me
Come with me
Come with me and I will show you Jesus
