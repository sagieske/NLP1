Song:

You and me don't see eye to eye
On every little thing
We've missed a lot of sunshine
And caught a lot of rain
If you want to leave I can't make you stay
But there is something I have to say

No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know

There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home

Restless hearts, looking for a love
Are waiting in the street
They're all prepared to give you
The bitter with the sweet
If you wake someday and you reach for me
Well you know, this is where I'll be

No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know

There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
