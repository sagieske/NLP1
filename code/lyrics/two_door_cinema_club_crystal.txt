Song:

Everything tonight
Made everything alright
I am speechless
I listen to your words
Float like hummingbirds all around me

Sweet mess suspend me in crystal

You and I were set
To float down with a map
See where it takes us
I left you on that street with shadow at your feet
I should've kissed you

Sweet mess suspend me in crystal
Sweet mess suspend me in crystal
