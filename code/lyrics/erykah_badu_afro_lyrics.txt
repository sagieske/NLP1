Intro: (Excuse us ladies and Gentlemen)

1..... 2... You need to pick yo afro daddy, Because
It's flat on one side..

You need to pick afro daddy, Because it's
Flat on one side. (What are you waitin on?)

Well... If you don't pick yo afro your gonna
Have one side high..

Well... You said you was going to take me to
Go see wu-Tang babyy..

So I braided my head... Well.... Yes you did

You said you was going to take me to see
Wu-Tang baby..

So I braided my head.....
Yes I did, conrolled and everything baby.

Well... You changed yo mind and said, we weren't
Going.... But my mom' ma saw you there. Yes
She did.. Check this out...

Well... I be blowin up yo pager daddy.....
But you never call me back...
Well..... I be puttin in 911 baby

But you never call me back...... L.. No no
See you don't know how to use that pager daddy
I'm goitang babyy..

So I braided my head... Well.... Yes you did

You said you was going to take me to see
Wu-Tang baby..

So I braided my head.....
Yes I did, conrolled and everything baby.

Well... You changed yo mind and said, we weren't
Going.... But my mom' ma saw you there. Yes
She did.. Check this out...

Well... I be blowin up yo pager daddy.....
But you never call me back...
Well..... I be puttin in 911 baby

But you never call me back...... L.. No no
See you don't know how to use that pager daddy
