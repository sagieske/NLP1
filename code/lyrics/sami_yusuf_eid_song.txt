Children are wearing new clothes
Bright colors fill the streets
Their faces are full of laughter
Their pockets are full of sweets

Chorus1
Chorus2

Mosques are full of worshippers in rows straight and neat
Their Lord they remember, His Name they repeat
Their hands are raised to the sky, they supplicate and plead
On this blessed day, "forgive us" they entreat

Chorus1
Chorus2

People are giving charity and helping those in need
In giving they're competing, today there is no greed

Chorus1
Chorus2

Enemies are embracing each other, old hatred is buried
Everyone is celebrating, greeting everyone they meet
