Song:

I'm a colored spade
A n****are, a black n****are
A jungle bunny, Jigaboo coon
Pickaninny mau mau

Uncle Tom, Aunt Jemima
Little Black Sambo

Cotton pickin'
Swamp guinea
Junk man
Shoeshine boy

Elevator operator
Table cleaner at Horn and Hardart
Slave voodoo, zombie
Ubangi lipped

Flat nose, tap dancin'
Resident of Harlem

And president of
The United States of Love
President of
The United States of Love

[Incomprehensible] this man at dinner
You're gonna have to feed him

Watermelon, hominy grits
An' shortnin' bread
Alligator ribs and pig tails
Some black eyed peas
Hot chilies

Some watermelon hominy grits
An' shortnin' bread, alligator ribs
Piggy tails, black eyed peas
Collard greens

And if you don't watch out
The boogie man will get you
Boo!

Did you hear what he said about boogie man?
That guy has got to be outta his mind
I think he said boogie man, that sure is nasty
[That's somthing you said]
