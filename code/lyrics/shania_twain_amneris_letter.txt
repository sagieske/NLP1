Song:

I'm sorry for everything I've said
And for anything I forgot to say too
When things get so complicated
I stumble, at best muddle through


I wish our lives could be so simple
I don't want the world, only you
Oh, I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time, never the place
And this letter will have to do
I love you
