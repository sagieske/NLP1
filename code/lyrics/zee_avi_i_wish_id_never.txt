Song:

Watching phantom planes go by
Sinking into the darkness of the night
The lady in the clouds is lyin' down
Beside Chopin while he plays her the words of heaven

Red light beaming just a little over the green familiar hill
I still don't know how to control how I think, or speak, or feel

So...

I wish I'd never fallen in love...
So deeply
I wish I'd never knew that love...
Actually exists

I got your letter today
Told me that you're back in therapy
And I don't know why but it still concerned me

But they tell me what's the point of hurting
Over something, that was nothing at all
I never used to be so gullible and vulnerable
But I guess with love nothing's impossible

So...

I wish I'd never fallen in love...
So deeply
I wish I'd never knew that love...
Actually exists

You said that I was good for you but you pushed me aside
Now tell me does that seem right?
I've fallen for a pessimist
Nut God help me I tried
To get you out of it

So...

I wish I'd never fallen in love...
So deeply
I wish I'd never knew that love...
Actually exists...

But I do now...
I do now...
