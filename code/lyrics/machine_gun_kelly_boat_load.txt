Song:

Inhale, sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, let's go
Yeah n****are, yeah n****are, I done re-upped
Got a fresh boat load of that loud stuff, took a million bucks
Got me high as f**k, made not paranoid
I got my forty tucks, smokin' and tokin' the kushin'
Looking for p***y that's gushin'
Hitting the swishers with b*****s
Living, enjoyin' my riches
Niggers can't get with this pimping,
Straight born and raised out of Memphis
Blunts in my mouth like a dentist
Roll one and get one up in it
Smoking on that medical, high up on a pedestal
Blowing on that green herb, feeling so incredible
Smoking get me high, but I be higher off them edibles
Still riding dirty but I'm dodging all the federals

Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, let's go

Yeah b***h, yeah bi-atch, call me Steve O
I'm a wild boy, f**k a eighth I need oz.
28 grams of the loudest pack,
Matter of fact make it a pound of that
Get a couple keys with sour diesel and lemon g that's sour patch
I ain't in a gang but my og's kush
Blow that loud, and it makes me shush
23 jays and a red bull, call me Michael Jordan it's that swoosh
It's that swoosh, it's that swoosh
Yo shit's a**, that's that tush
This right here is my bag
Of purple marijuana, don't burn that bush
Everyday's Christmas Eve with me
Everybody celebrates like nothings free
Tell Santa Clause I got special cookies for him,
When he comes down my chimney
I got munchies here, munchies there,
Leftover chinese in my Frigidaire
I'm the Iron Chef of this munchie s**t
Smoke everyday, f**k the air, inhale

Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale, inhale
Sour diesel white little kush, by the boat, let's go.
