Song:

Chorus
I hear the voices
They sing to me sweetly
Guiding my footsteps
If only you believe
You know this is divine love

I thought that love was over
I thought that it was too late
And just when I was gonna throw it all away
I heard the voices of the angels say

Pre chorus
I know how hard your way
I know how much youve tried
I know the struggles you're going through
The father sends to you
Up above

Chorus

I was only half alive
When I came to realize
There was someone whod be there for me
I heard the melodies from heaven ring

Pre chorus
Chorus

Bridge
I sing a song
If it makes me feel happy inside
I know the lord
Showers me comforts me with divine love
