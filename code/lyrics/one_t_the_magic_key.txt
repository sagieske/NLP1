Song:

(Listen up)
Till my days
Change my ways

This sudden end to my days
Makes me wish I'd changed my ways
Spent more time with the posse
One-t, nine-t, bull-t, me
From up here, life seems so small
What's the
Meaning of it all?
Miss the way it used to be
One-t, nine-t, bull-t, me

Where in the world could I be?
Homies looking so cool, cool, I'm cool-t!
Tuxedos made of snow
Is there something I should know?
Mom and Pop and little bro
Dead is gone so long ago
Could this be paradise at last?
The first test I've ever passed

Chorus:
Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen from magic key (listen up)

Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen like your life be free(magic key)

Blissful days, what you gonna do?
Still I miss my old t-crew
Can't afterlive without'em
I just wish they only knew!
May they have lived without a home
But my homies love me kept me warm
Taught me to forget 'bout the game
Money, hatred, hunger, pain

This sudden end to my days
Makes me wish I'd changed my ways
Spent more time with the posse
One-t, Nine-t, Bull-t, me

Chorus:
Music's the odyssey(yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen from the magic key (yours truly)

Music's the odyssey(yeah)
It's here for you, for me (magic key)
Just listen like your life be free

Missing you, missing you
Missing you, magic crew

Missing you, missing you
Missing you, magic crew

Had a meeting with my maker
The superhuman baker
He popped me in the oven
And set the dial to lovin'
Now I watch over my boys
Help'em keep on making noise
Never pictured me with wings
Guess I've heard of stranger things

Chorus:
Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen from magic key (cool-T yours to me)

Music's the odyssey (aha, aha)
It's here for you, for me (yeah, yeah)
Just listen like your life be free (cool-T yours to me)

Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen from magic key

Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen like your life be free
