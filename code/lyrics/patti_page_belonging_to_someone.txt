Song:

(Someone just, just like you)
(Someone just, just like you)

Belonging to someone is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Knowing there's someone who cares makes my heart sing
(My heart sings, it ting-a-lings)

Belonging to someone can be worth more than silver or gold
Love is a gift from above to have and to hold
(Hold me tight, hold me tight)

To be alone yet never lonely
Is to reach your shining star
When you have found your one and only
How lucky, lucky you are

Belonging to someone is a heavenly dream that comes true, oh, yes, it does
Sweet as a beautiful song written for two
Oh, how I long to belong to someone like you

(Someone just, just like you)
(Someone just, just like you)
