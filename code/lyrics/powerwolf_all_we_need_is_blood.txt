Song:

Sanctus Christi animo
Haleluja amen
Corpus sado mudu so
Haleluja amen

All we need is blood
In the name of God
You can't break us
Can't forsake us
If you believe it or not

Army of the night
Raised and born to fight
You can't rail us
Can't imaple us
High all night, for all we need is blood

All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
Haleluja
All we need is blood

When the moon is high
Told you soon will die
We transpire, blood and fire
All we can take on the spot

First we take your soul
Then we lose control
You can't stake us
Can't awake us
From the night, for all we need is blood

All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
Haleluja, amen

Haemophili animus
Haemophili animus
Haemophili animus
Blood is what we need tonight
Haemophili animus
Haemophili animus
Haemophili animus
Blood is what we need tonight

Hail the blood of Christ
Purgatory priced
Your messiah, down the pyre
Lord up high, we praise you for the blood

All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
All we need is, all we need is, all we need is
Blood, blood, blood
Haleluja
All we need is blood
