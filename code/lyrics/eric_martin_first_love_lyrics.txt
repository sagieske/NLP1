Song:

I still regret the last time that we kissed
The scent of your perfume so strong on my lips
The cold that it takes of the sad goodbye

Where have you gone baby are you alone
I wish you'd call and tell me, When you were wrong
Will you dream of me, like I dream of you tonight

You're always gonna be my love, my whole life
There are moments that are just meant to last forever
I remember to love you taught me how

You're always gonna be the one I count it on
Without you I'm feeling so lost and lonely
I never will forget my first love

It's so strange to me, our time has done
Even though I try can't move on
I can still see your eyes
They won't let me go

Where have you gone baby are you alone
I'm missing you so badly
I keep on crying
And all my tears never washed away the pain

You're always be inside my heart apart of me
Nothing I can do with every love to change it
I hope that I have a place in your heart too

Now and forever you are still the one I count it on
Without you I'm feeling so lost and lonely
I never will forget my first love

You're always gonna be my love, my whole life
There are moments that are just meant to last forever
I remember to love you taught me how

You're always gonna be the one
Without you I'm feeling so lost so lonely
Now and forever my love
