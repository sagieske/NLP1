Song:

Don't walk the cold and ruthless streets
They drain the life from all they meet
The servants crying underground
Smelling mortal blood like hounds
As you crawl the sewer pipes
Deadly sinners set to strike
As you walk around the bend
You'll be dead right there where you stand

Flash of iron, leather, spikes, and swords
Mighty warriors with metal on their side
Enemies of metal, your death is our reward
Triumphant victory when you bring the steel to life

Deadly sinners
Victory when you bring the steel to life

Crushing the light, stalking the night
Deadly sinners always win

Kill the tyrant's endless conquest
With no mercy, straight for his heart
Bloodlust will overtake anger and violence
Without warning, lightning strikes in the dark
Lightning strikes

Flash or iron, leather, spikes and swords
Those mighty warriors with metal on their side
Enemies of metal, your death is our reward
Triumphant victory when you bring the steel to life

Deadly sinners
(deadly shit)
Victory when you bring the steel to life

Ruling the night, winning the fight
Taking it all right to the end
Ruling the night, Winning the fight
Take one last step before you die
