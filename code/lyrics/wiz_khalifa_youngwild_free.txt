[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep 'em rolled up
Saggin' my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my n-ggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I'm with you b-tch smokin' grade A

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Snoop Dogg - Verse 2]
Yeah, uh you know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Mp3junkyard.blogspot.com
Oh My God, I'm on the chase
Chevy, it's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keep slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front four blunts, like "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa - Bridge]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus x2]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
