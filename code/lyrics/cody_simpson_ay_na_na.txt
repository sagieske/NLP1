Song:

Ay na na na na na x 4
I always thought that love at first sight was something just make believe
'Till the day you walked by and for the first time, I couldn't find the words to speak
Said I want to know ya (yeah, yeah), 
I'll do anything, to get a little closer
And she's looking like
Hey boy come over
And if I get her, swear I'll never let her go, ho ho
Oohhh, and we can't get off the floor, next thing you know she coming home
To me, my mama and I can't believe it all started with me saying

Ay na na na na na girl you're the one I want
Ay na na na na na
And she was like, hey boy I just can't take my eyes off
Ay na na na na na think I love you x2

They can say whatever they like, thinking will never last
But every day we moving on up, yeah we never looking back (looking back)
See I had to get to know ya (yeah, yeah)
I did everything, to get a little closer (yeah, yeah)
Now we riding on this love rollercoaster (yeh, yeah)
And I don't even wanan get up, I wanna keep rolling
Oooh, we went from talking on the phone, now everyday I'm rushing home
Is she my dream girl, can't believe it all started with me saying

Ay na na na na na girl you're the one I want
Ay na na na na na
And she was like, hey boy I just can't take my eyes off
Ay na na na na na think I love you x2

Whe knew she's my future, better everyday
Who knew that she wanna be my everything
It's over she's all I
Ever gonna need and more
I can't believe it all started with

Whe knew he's my future, better everyday
Who knew that he wanna be my everything
It's over he's all I
Ever gonna need and more
I can't believe it all started with

Ay na na na na na girl you're the one I want
Ay na na na na na
And she was like, hey boy I just can't take my eyes off (she can't)
Ay na na na na na think I love you x2
Ay na na na na na x 4
And I think I love ya
