Song:

Well I apologized when I picked her up
Said this old truck is just a fixer up
She smiled and said hey that's ok just a couple letters missing from the
Chevrolet
I pulled out of her country club neighborhood
She was over there looking so damn good
And I was feeling every bit of my side of the tracks
But she took care of that when she pulled out that moon shine
Tasted like an apple pie We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho' nuff messing me up
Till I couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her
And that apple pie moonshine well we were dancing around in the high beams
Her hands in the back pockets of my jeans the radio playing the perfect
Song
I still think about her every time the thing comes on
And I never forget that first kiss
When a country boy got to hold a real princess I can still taste the
Cinnamon on her lips
Every time I reminisce
It's sweeter than moonshine tasting like an apple pie
We were wishing and kissing and sipping that stuff
Sho' nuff messing me up
Till I couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes
I never felt so fine caught up in a good time between her and that apple
Pie moonshine yeah, 
I couldn't tell the moonlight from the stars in her eyes I never felt so
Fine
Caught up in a good time between her and that apple pie moonshine
Apple pie moonshine
