Song:

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Where love goes, I know where love goes
Oh I know where love goes. Know where love goes, yeah
If we wanted our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bed heads
We can make light out of thin air
We can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer then right now
But whatever you do don't let go
My only nightmare is when your loves gone
Alone when your not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That's when I never sleep with my back to you

[Hook:]
When I lay it down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ri-ride with me
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart, and your pillows
Whatever you do just don't go
Baby?
Alone in the world when your not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I'm looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

[Hook:]
When I lay it down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you)

[Bridge:]
Like a nightlight, like a?
Like toddlers playing
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children

[Hook:]
When I lay it down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
When I lay it down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids close (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though (I never sleep with my back to you, back to you)
