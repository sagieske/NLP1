Song:

You said you'd die for the couse.
But you haven't lived for s**t.
You have not lived for naything.
What happened to my generation?
Why do we always fall short?
Just a bunch of corrupt minds running reckless under an empty sky.
This is the generation that ruined the world.
Is this why people have fought and died?
Not my kind.
We are the ones with open eyes.
We are brought together through hatred.
I hate my generation bring back prohibition.
This is the generation that ruined the world.
This is the generation that has no hope.
We are the ones with open eyes.
We are brought together through hatred.
We are the ones with open eyes.
Brothers stand tall...
