Song:

Lets go, lets go, lets go, lets go, lets go,

Now throw your hands up
Shake them hips girl
Now drop it down low (low low)
Do that Kuduro

Lettme see ya work it,
But please don't break it
Girl keep off the floor (floor floor),
Do that Kuduro

Don't even fight it, try to deny it
Let the beat take you over
Let cha hair go, drop it real low
Right now girl nothing matters
Winding and spinning all the way around
Shorty lettme see ya get get down
Up up I go, a couple more shots
S*** let me see ya Kuduro now

Chorus (x2)
Now throw your hands up
Shake them hips girl
Now drop it down low (low low)
Do that Kuduro.

Lettme see ya work it,
But please don't break it
Girl keep off the floor (floor floor),
Do that Kuduro.

Girl just go crazy
Back it up on me
Grind it like a private dancer
Baby go fast, now slow down
Working like a part-time lover
Winding and spinning all the way around
Shorty lettme see ya get get down,
Up up I go,
A couple more shots
S*** lettme see ya Kuduro now.

Chorus
Now throw your hands up
Shake them hips girl
Now drop it down low (low low)
Do that Kuduro.

Lettme see ya work it,
But please don't break it
Girl keep off the floor (floor floor),
Do that Kuduro.

(Spanish Verses)

One life, two worlds
English, Spanish
One night, two girls
English, Spanish

Bridge x2
Let your body relax,
Let all in the air
Let yourself, just let go
Lose control everywhere

Chorus
Now throw your hands up (s*** girl)
Shake them hips girl (s*** girl)
Now drop it down low (low low) (s*** girl)
Do that Kuduro.

Lettme see ya work it, (s*** girl)
But please don't break it (s*** girl)
Girl keep off the floor (floor floor) (s*** girl),
Do that Kuduro
