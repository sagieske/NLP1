Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh - Vengaboys are back in town
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh

If you're alone and you need a friend
Someone to make you forget your problems
Just come along baby take my hands
I'll be your lover tonight

Ohohoh ohohoh - this is what I wanna do
Ohohoh ohohoh - let's have some fun
Ohohoh ohohoh - one on one, just me and you

Boom boom boom boom!
I want you in my room
Let's spend the night together
From now until forever
Boom boom boom boom!
I wanna go boom boom
Let's spend the night together
Together in my room
Ohohoh ohohoh - everybody get on down
Ohohoh ohohoh - Vengaboys are back in town

Ohohoh ohohoh - this is what I wanna do
Ohohoh ohohoh - lets have some fun
Ohohoh ohohoh - one on one, just me and you
Ohohoh ohohoh

Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh
Ohohoh ohohoh
