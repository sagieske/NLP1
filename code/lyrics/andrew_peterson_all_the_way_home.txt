Song:

Daniel hollered goodbye to the old river barge
With a dream in his head and a bride in his arms
Everyone said, "You're crazy:
But everyone longed to go

So from Memphis to Lakeport my grandfather came
Six girls and a boy grew up in that Florida rain
They were carried along like leaves on a river of faith
They'd float

All the way home
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
By the grace of God
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
And, oh, they walked in the rain of His mercy
All the way home
I have slept in the house where my mother was born
And I've seen the sun set on the lake that gave birth to those storms
Well, they may not have walked on water
But I know that their house stood firm

All the way home
They followed the tracks that the saints have trod
By the grace of God
They walked in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak them down to the bone
And they splashed in its puddles
And danced in its streams as they'd go
And, oh, they walked in the rain of His mercy

When they sat in their home
When they walked along the road
When they slept and when they rose
The words of the Lord were impressed on their minds
And after all this time
I'm carried along like a leaf on a river of faith
And I'll float

All the way home
Yes, I'll follow the tracks that the saints have trod
By the grace of God
I'll walk in the rain of His mercy
Let it soak me down to the bone
And I'll splash in its puddles
And dance in its streams as I go
And, Lord, I'll walk in the rain of Your mercy
All the way home
