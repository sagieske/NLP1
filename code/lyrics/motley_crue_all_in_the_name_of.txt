Song:

She's only fifteen
She's the reason - the reason thet I can't sleep
You say illegal
I say legal's never been my scene
I try like hell but I'm out of control

All in the name of rock'n'roll
For s** and s** I'd sell my soul

Pretty, pretty so innocent
She says you ain't seen nothing yet
Brings me a dirty, dirty magazine
There she was for all the world to see
I try like hell but I'm out of control

All in the name of rock'n'roll
For s** and s** I'd sell my soul

Says to me daddy
Can I have some candy
Wanna be your nasty
Anytime you want
You know you can have me

All in the name of rock'n'roll
