Song:

Oh yeah
Baby come back to me
Remember how it used to be
Paradise is just out of reach
Baby won't you please come back to me

Another night here alone
Staring at the telephone
Willing you to make that call
To bring you backwhere you belong

It's been three hard weeks, baby the longest night
I need to hear your voice
And feel your soft skin by my side
We said things that we shouldn't have
I take back every word
Don't you know I can turn back time
It's only you and I that pay the price

Baby come back to me
Remember how it used to be
Without you I'm incomplete
I feel the pain with every heartbeat
Baby come back to me
Inside I'm dying piece by piece
Paradise is just out of reach
Baby won't you please come back to me

The day that we said goodbye
No holding back the tears we've cried
Searching for the reasons why
We let this love just fade and die
All the riches in the world
All the diamonds and the pearls
I'd give to send the winds of chance
To bring you back to me again
Oh say that we can heal the pain
Turn the spark into a flame
I know that we can bring it nack again
So baby please can't you see I'm down on my knees

Baby come back to me
Remember how it used to be
Without you I'm incomplete
I feel the pain with every heartbeat
Baby come back to me
Inside I'm dying piece by piece
Paradise is just out of reach
Baby won't you please come back to me

Baby, baby, baby...
You're in every, every breath I breathe baby
(baby, baby, baby)
You're in every, every dream I dream baby
(baby, baby, baby)
This time will last forever
Give it all a try, each and each day I pray
Oh girl, yes I pray
Please come back

Baby come back to me
Remember how it used to be
Without you I'm incomplete
I feel the pain with every heartbeat
Baby come back to me
Inside I'm dying piece by piece
Paradise is just out of reach
Baby won't you please come back to me
