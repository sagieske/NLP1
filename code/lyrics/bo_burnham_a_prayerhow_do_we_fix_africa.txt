Song:

Let us pray
Oh ah please don't feel like you can't participate if your not Christian
Cause this is a prayer for all faiths

Dear Jesus of Nazareth
First of all I'd like to thank you for calling yourself Jesus of Nazareth
It's sort of like the Lord of the Rings or something
"I am Jesus of Nazareth, Son of Orflec the butcher"

We know lord, from John 3: 16, that you so loved the world
That you sent your only son to die for us
Your only son
But at the same time, we're all your children
So in your eyes we're a bunch of girls
So help us as we struggle with the temptations of lesbianism
Amen

People come to me all the time
All the time
They say the same thing, you know
Bo, your an artist
How do we fix Africa?

I read recently that there are over 22 million people living with hiv aids in Sub Saharan Africa
I know it's a Snapple fact
How do we fix it? How do we fix it?
This, because laughter is the best medicine you know
Besides medicine
