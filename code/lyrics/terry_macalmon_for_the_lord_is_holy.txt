For the Lord is holy, for the Lord is worthy,
For the Lord lovely, lover of my soul;
For the Lord is holy, for the Lord is worthy,
For the Lord lovely, lover of my soul;

For the Lord is holy, for the Lord is worthy,
For the Lord lovely, lover of my soul;
For the Lord is holy, for the Lord is worthy,
For the Lord lovely, lover of my soul;
