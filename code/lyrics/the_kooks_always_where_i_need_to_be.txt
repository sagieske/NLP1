Song:

She don't know who she is
Oh I can take her anywhere
Do whatever comes natrually to you
You know she just don't care
You know she just don't care

Because I am always where I need to be
And I always though I would end up
With you, eventually
Do dodo do do do do...

Now I see her again
I asked to be a hummingbird
Whisper words in her ear
Oh now you know I just don't care
You know she just don't care

Because I am always where I need to be
And I always thought I would end up
With you, eventually
Do dodo do do do do...

Say!

I'm a man, I'm a man, oh
I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man I can be so obscene because I
Always think that I know, how to be
But I always thought I would end up with you eventually

Do do-do do do do do...

Say!

I'm a man, I'm a man, oh
I'm a man on the scene
I'm a man, I'm a man
I can be so obscene
