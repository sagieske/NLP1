Song:

Held captive, I'm a prisoner
In the back room where the water leaks and I'm oh, so cold
Command me on what to do, but we both know that neither you or I are in
Control

There's nothing left for me here
I'm grabbing on what's left of this hole, it's all too real this can't be
Happening

Never again, ever again, will I say I'm Ok
I'm scared of the fate that will become mine

No time to talk you know the drill

Under my desk this can't be it
I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming
But I can't get up. No time to talk, not this time, this is my place
This is where I arrange

It's so funny how we see things so clear when we have no time left to
Live

So lay back now and take it in
I won't say a word. I won't say anything

I can't believe how it feels
To stand here in this room
And feel like it's going to blow
I think we're all going to blow

I've got to be dreaming
We've got to be dreaming
Please don't wake me up
This is the end
