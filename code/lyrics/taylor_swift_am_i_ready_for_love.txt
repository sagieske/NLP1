Song:

Sometimes I wonder
How it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when
My heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call

And my daddy tells me
That I light up his world
Everyday he says "Darlin, 
You're my best girl"
He tried to teach me
From the very start
The meaning of love
So nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?
For love

I know I'm not a little
Girl anymore
Cuz I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Sweet sensations
And anticipations
Calling commotion
To my emotions

And I hear the words
My daddy says to me
He said "be true to yourself
And keep your spirit free
And love will find you One way or another
Be good to yourself
And be good to each other"

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for love?

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of it's hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in the pourin' rain?
Am I ready for the joy?
Am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy?
Am I ready for this game?
Am I ready for the kiss?
Am I ready for the stars?
Am I ready for the bliss?
Am I ready for love?
