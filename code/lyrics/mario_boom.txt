Uh yeh
Uh wot up c'mon c'mon
Don't stop don't stop

Juvenile and mario here and we on deck
So stay tuned to your programmes cause we on next
I wanna see the women catching the wall
Unless she got that disease no a** at all
For the hood for the club, videos or whatever
I got the old skool the bentley or the porshe carrera
Pro styling with the top on.. Whilin'
Looking for a dime piece that I can knock off

Up in the spot sippin' on a little somethin'
Feeling like this stress bout to pop off
Lookin' around tryin' to spot a little somethin'
Tryin to see what somebody's talkin' bout
And then this girl, all up in my ear
Chew a lil' bit of game, all up in my ear
I think I found a window over here
Homegirl, it's all up in my face like

Oooooooooo oh yes indeed
All we needed was a hell of a beat like
Oooooooooo and we gon dance cause I feelin like yeah tonight
Hold up it's like

Boom that's that beat we like
That'll make the party jump up
Boom dj spin that twice
We about to tear this club up
Boom ladies you gotta move sum cause
Boom the fellas wanna see you shake somethin' like
Boom we got the party gettin' crunk
If you don't give a damn go an' throw it up now

No more sittin' on the wall lil' shawty
Startin na feel like a stone cold party
Don't be actin' like you can't sit with me
Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy
Ain't this beat on fire
Dj spin that back one more time
Fill my glass up one more time
We gon' start it off right on time like
