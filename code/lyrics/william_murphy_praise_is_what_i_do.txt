Song:

Solo
Praise is what I do
When I want to be close to You, 
I lift my hands in praise.
Praise is who I am, 
I will praise Him while I can.
I'll bless Him at all times.

Chorus
I vow to praise You
Through the good and the bad.
I'll praise You, 
Whether happy or sad.
I'll praise You

(This is my testimony)
In all that I go through, 
(Somebody said why)
Because praise is what I do, 
Cause I owe it all to You.

Verse 1
(Come on church)
Praise is what I do
(Come on church)
When I want to be close to You, 
(I lift my hands-somebody lift Him)
I lift my hands in praise.
(Somebody say it so the devil will hear you)
Praise is who I am, 
(Come on praise the Lord)
I will praise Him while I can.
I'll bless Him at all times.

Chorus
And I vow to praise You
Through the good and the bad.
I'll praise You, 
Whether happy or sad.
I'll praise You
(Somebody lift your voice and say)

Verse 2
Praise is what I do, 
Even when I am going through, 
(See I've learned...)
I've learned to worship You.
(See I want to let the devil know tonight, even though...)
Though my circumstance doesn't even stand a chance, 
My praise out weighs the bad.

(So I vow to praise)

Repeat Chorus

Now somebody lift your voice
And just go to praising him right now
Somebody lift your voice in this place
Lift up your voice in this place
