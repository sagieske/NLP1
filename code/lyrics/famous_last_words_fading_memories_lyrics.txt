Song:

Cook it up just to numb the pain,
Pull the belt in a search to find my last vein.
Like a felon in for life I’m wasting away,
It’s the only thing in life that keeps my mind sane.

But was it worth the consequences?
It numbs the hurt, it numbs the pain.
Cause in the end I lost a friend who died in vain.
I could never get enough to heal the pain,
It all went wrong, he was left defenseless.
He should not have died, it should be me.

But now I see that if I believed in something,
We’d be alive, but now we’re nothing.

[Chorus:]
But it made me feel,
It set me free,
It cloaked the pain that tortured me.
It made me blind I couldn’t see,
The only one to blame was me.
It was my selfish lies
That caused the end of his life,
And now he’s gone and so are we,
We’re all just fading memories.
Destined to fail.

Sink back as the drugs take way,
Through my veins I feel my life begin to fade.
What’s done is done and it ain’t ever gonna change,
It’s the only thing in life that keeps me sane.

My skin turns pale as the drugs destroy my soul within.
It’s poison, complete, bittersweet, defeat I’ll never win.
I’ll give in. Let go of the life I wish I never began.
This man is sick so I ask myself.

Well what if I believed in something.
We’d be alive, but now we’re nothing.

[Chorus:]
But it made me feel,
It set me free,
It cloaked the pain that tortured me.
It made me blind I couldn’t see,
The only one to blame was me.
It was my selfish lies
That caused the end of his life,
And now he’s gone and so are we,
We’re all just fading memories.
Destined to fail.

Destined to fail.

I’m falling faster Gaining speed to a fate I can’t believe,
I’m a disaster A one-way ticket to hell made just for me.
I’m sorry mother, I’m not the man that you thought that I would be.
Now it’s all over, Hell’s awaiting me.
