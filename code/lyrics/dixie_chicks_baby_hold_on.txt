Song:

Hey, it might never be the same
We might never live those days gone by
But we can try

Good morning
Let's kick the babies out of bed
How bout you and me instead hanging on
Not up and gone

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older now
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holding on
Hold on to me

Baby, it's good to see you smile again
I know we can't escape
So let's pretend
We're someplace else

It's a new day
Let's look at all we've got
It's everything we thought
We ever wanted
It's beautiful

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older now
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holding on
Hold on to me

I look across the room and catch you staring at me
And see the love we almost left behind
So lead me by the hand and let's make up
Let's make up for lost time

(Baby, hold on)
Let's start this over
(Baby, hold on)
We're not much older
(Baby, hold on)
If you still see what I see
Keep holding on

(Baby, hold on)
Hold on to me
(Baby, hold on)
Just hold on to me
(Baby, hold on)
Hold on to me
Keep holding on

Hey, it might never be the same
We might never live those days gone by
But we can try
