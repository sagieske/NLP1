[Guy:]
It's Baby C... With Baby J
By your side... Yeah...

[Girl:]
I'll be the one to make you smile
Whenever your feeling down
And when your feeling lonely look to your side I'll be around
I found love
New meaning to love
Ever since the day I met you
You're the only one who cares for me
The only one who guides me through

[Guy:]
Baby girl whenever I'm with chu it's like I have a lucky charm
Come on over here girl let me take you into my arms
Cuz you know this baby girl I wont ever do you harm
Cuz you know I'm by your side everyday and all night
Whenever you'll have a fright in my arms that's where you'll hide
I'll be there for you if you need a she'd of cry
I'll call you every night
Ever time that chu feel lonely
The only things I need in life is you girl and my homies
Don't worry baby girl come to me if you feel scared
I know it from the past I'm the only one who cared
We'll live with our life happily and even blessed
Every corner every way I'll try to sneak a kiss, yo

[Girl:]
I'll be the one to make you smile
Whenever your feeling down
And when your feeling lonely
Look to your side I'll be around
I found love
New meaning to love
Ever since the day I meet you
You're the only one who cares for me
The only one who guides me through
Your all I ever wanted
All I ever asked for
Even more
After each day it's seems we grow more closer then before
Here we are the best of two lovers
Never want us to be over
Heaven made us for each other
You just don't know how much you mean to me
There's only you in my heart
Till the end
Since the start
You and I can never be torn apart
We'll last for eternity
This love we have so true
No one else compares to you
No one can take your place
Your place in my heart and soul
You play the perfect role to make my heart a whole
No words can ever become by to add up to how I feel inside... Baby I love you
I'll be the one to make you smile
Whenever you feeling down
And when your feeling lonely I look to your side I'll be around
I found love new meaning to love ever since the day I met you
You're the only one who cares for me
The only one who guides me through

[Guy:]
So your standing in your heart
So that I could see your feelings
Who knows about the day
When I get down and kneeling
With the ring in my hand
I'm about to change your world so that we can get married
It's complete that chu ma girl
I ain't that type of men who will leave you crying tears
I'll be the man that stays caring for you all throughout the years
I'll suite your heart with things so that chu could keep on smiling
I'll love you more
If you agree to we play on fighting
So just think about the future
Just loving one another
If you think about it clearly
We will always be two lovers
With the trust and respect
That every couple needs
To shine within happily
Truly to succeed

[Girl:]
I'll be the one to make you smile
Whenever your feeling down
And when your feeling lonely look to your side I'll be around
I found love
New meaning to love
Ever since the day I met you
You're the only one who cares for me
The only one who guides me through
