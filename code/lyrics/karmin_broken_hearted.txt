Song:

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, uh oh
Didn't wanna take it slow
In a daze, going crazy, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, uh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow
Uh oh yep

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacing
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Uh don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Uh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on a Patr√≥n
Just to calm my nerves, uh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, call me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, uh oh
I don't even think you know, no no

See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say is like go with the view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?

This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio

See, I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight, ohhhohohhhoohhhh
Honest baby, I'll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheeri, cheerio

When you gonna call
Don't leave me broken hearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh!
