Song:

Don't leave me don't leave me
I'm begging of you
My prescious, my only sweet girl
Don't leave me don't leave me
I'll die if you do
And you're all that I have in the world
You're all that I have in the world

I care not for treasures of silver and gold
I care not for diamonds and pearls
Love may not be measured or traded or sold
And you're all that I have in the world
You're all that I have in the world

Not a word of a warning would you give to me
My prescious, my only sweet girl
You'd leave me in the morning
And I'll be calling for you
And you're all that I have have in the world
You're all that I have in the world
