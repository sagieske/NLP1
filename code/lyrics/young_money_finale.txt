[Gudda Gudda]

They call me Young Gudda,
I'm all about the doe still,
And anybody in my way, Roadkill,
Evrything my hands touch turn to gold,
Money, Knots and Jewels with no records sold, (Yeah)
I'm Manhandling rappers with no effort,
So imagine what'll happen when I start applying pressure,
Guillotine flow who ready to get severed n-gga
In or out the booth you could get leveled n-gga

[Jae Millz]

Yo, We are Young Money,
N-gga you can't chocha,
It's bout to get real ugly, Amarosa,
Ym vultures, there ain't a family doper,
We done changed the way the game look, Sammie Sosa, (Ha Ha)
This is life this ain't a job, Audemare and Shapor,
Just symbolize I go hard,
Navy on Navy Camero I did all for the yankees,
Did it all for New York and this love no need to thank me

[Tyga]

Uhh, fast money I don't slow dance,
Young Money muthaf-cka till the world end,
Money over weight, b***h, Rosanne,
I don't listen to these kids, Grown man,
Skinny n-gga dubbed up, Low hand,
Lindsey the white benz, same colour mike skin,
Make ya soul spin when the ping loading,
Au revoir, goodbye, now applaud

[Lil Chuckee]

Young money lil G,
Battle juice in my blood,
Jumpin at the boy,
Man, you better have ya bungee cord,
Since Wayne took me off the leash,
I ain't lose a fight yet,
Now come drag ya dog out the ring how he love that,
Yung wid a attitude, watch how ya talk to me,
Keep playin freddy boi, I'll leak on ya elm street,
Trouble is what you want dog, pain is what you don't get,
It's Young money till the bone grizzle

[Lil Twist]

Young money good night,
And yeah I'm gonna shine like an Ultra Violet light,
Lil twist cold cellar like it's opening tonight,
31'st n-gga to write, You need a telescope sight,
To try to see me, I'm so far gone,
Even though I'm goin out kids, I'm so far on
I gotta house full of cheques like the playboy home,
Wrapping up my lifestyle and I smashed this song
Twizzy

[Nicki Minaj]

I'm in that cotton pink bent,
Put mass on the guts,
White on white whips,
Kunta Kinte on the clutch,
You at the bottom of the pole, Totem,
Like Lamar Odom, I ball, scrotom,
Flyer than a cricket so they call me Nicki Jim-any,
And it's going down like Santa in the chimney,
You don't ball break ya baby back ribs,
You need more assist than the handicap kids

[Shanell]

Young money we rockstars,
So f-ck wit ya magnum on,
And hold on we go long,
You feel that, We get that,
We in that, we run that, we bus back,
We hit em when we see em coming back for more,
Back for more...

[Mack Maine]

Michael wade family in the building you can't hold us,
Me, taz and wayne we the 3 new moguls,
Buffet around here ya'll boys scrape the plates,
And we don't eat up in our whispa they got paper plates,
Soon as we leave the club damn let the models go,
One word I forgot to say on his album, Hollygrove!,
This track different now they nod this the genesis,
Young money murderers, We killin s**t,
Forever...

[Drake]

Alright I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nuthin you would think I'm playin tetris,
Thousand dollar sweater on but I never sweat s**t,
Swear the beats they give me got a muthaf-ckin death wish,
Yeah, tell me who controls kings, I don't follow rules, stupid old things,
I'm flying through the city in a coupe with those wings,
My team deserves some muthaf-ckin supabowl rings, Young Money

[Lil Wayne]

I'm so in this b***h, ceo in this b***h,
Lil Weezy stand tall, Tippytoe in this b***h
Blood gang muthaf-cka da da doe in this b***h,
Make ya girl get Barry Manilow in this b***h,
In the body of the World, money is the blood,
And everyday I be back and forward to the blood bank,
Uhh making deposits till I f-cking faint,
New Orleans, n-gga how about no f-cking saints,
It's tight on our end call that bubbafranks,
Matter fact it's too tight add a couple links,
I'm the barstender you a women drink,
Yeah it's young money but the money aint,
Gudda tough, Nelly nice, Nick nasty,
Streets bad, Tyga Ill, Drake magic,
Millz harlem, Chuck wild, Twist Dallas,
And mack maine rap, sing and manage,
Uhhhh

It's Young Mulah Baby...
