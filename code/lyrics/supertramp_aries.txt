Song:

Alright, let's get the whole thing cooking

I try to run in a different race
But every time I seem to lose faith
Making it is hard, but taking is easy
But I got to keep trying to lessen my pace
Oh, dubidaidai, dubidaidaidada...

I try to walk down a city street
I say hello to the people I meet
They're walking their way, thinking I'm crazy
But I have so much trouble just keeping the beat

Well my way of life is simple
'Cause I just do what I please
Whatever I was blessed with
It wasn't a life of peace
It's all right, yeah, here she comes

Oh, maybe I'm just a country boy
The city life will bring me no joy
Well it's bringing me down, it's making me lonely
You see I'm fooling with life and it ain't no toy

Well my way of life is simple
'Cause I just do what I please
And whenever I got problems
I just call upon Aries

All right yeah
Here she comes
Here she comes
