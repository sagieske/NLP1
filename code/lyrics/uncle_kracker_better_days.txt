Song:

85 miles out of Nashville, thinkin bout the way things change
Try an keep it by the reigns
I'm a lone drifter, big money flipper
Take anything you got on the rocks in a snifter
I missed her in Kentucky, went down to Louisiana
I never had no lovin like I had in Alabama
A man of my word and out to hurt nobody
I'm just a mc to keep the boogie in the party
Been sittin lodi dodi since 84 and
I'll be sittin lodi dodi till I'm eighty four
I couldn't ask for more, life's been sweet
So you can save the planet I'll save your seat

I been gone for weeks, I ain't slept in days
I can't find myself in this self made maze
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin to see the bottom of the bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way

I never thought about change until
Spend a little time where time stood still
Been lookin for a mill, but I keep comin up shy
I been a broke fool, I ain't tryin to be that guy
Wanna ride like lightning, roll like thunder
I'm tryin to get some money I ain't gettin any yonger
At times I wonder at, at times I won't
Sometimes I give a fuck, but most times I don't
Don't, don't even care
Through stained glass windows these eyse stare
I try to stay straight but it's kickin my ass
Everytime I look ahead I get a glimpse of the past
I sit half mass like a soldier's flag
That's why my left leg limp's and my Dickies sag
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin to see the bottom of the bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way

Well I been all around this crooked land
I came across all walks, I shook Jim Beam's hand
I got no plans and no place to go
It keeps gettin harder to just say no
I see the people laugh and I see the people cry
That's how some live and that's how some die
Well me, myself I'm gonna sit righ here
And I'm a watch this this world break down in tears
All my fears and dark gray skies
Couldn't crack my smile or break my stride
Got too much pride, I got too much shout
I might be down, but I still ain't out
Got to much time and that's all I have
When I leave this world I'll still be sad
It's been so long since I've been fine
I'm just tryin to see the bottom of the bottle of wine
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
And I know I'll see better days
Well I know you'll see things my way
