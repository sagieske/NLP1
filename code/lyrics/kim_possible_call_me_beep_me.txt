Song:

I'm your basic average girl
And I'm here to save the world
You can't stop me 'cuz I'm
Kim Possible
There is nothin' I can't do
'Cuz when danger calls just know that I am on my way
(Know that I am on my way)
Doesn't matter where or when there's trouble,
If you just call my name-
Kim Possible
Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
When you wanna page me it's okay
I just can't wait until I hear my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night,
Everything is gonna be alright
Whenever you need me baby,
Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
Doesn't matter where,
Doesn't matter when
(doesn't matter when)
I will be there for you
Till the very end
(till the very end)

Danger or trouble
I'm there on the double
You know that you always can call
Kim Possible

(so whats the sitch)

Call me beep me if you wanna reach me
