Song:

The shades gone up
Mothers staring down
She don't know where he's been
Or how long he's been out

She said 'Boy I'm tired of waiting up while your out with your friends'
He said 'Mom I'm tired and I'm living my life the best way that I can'

Cause I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I wont ever let you down

The day has come
The sun is moving on
She don't know where he'll go
Or when he's coming home

She said 'Son take care, don't let your dreams get too far out of sight'
He said 'i love you now, don't worry about me you know i'll be fine'

Cause I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I wont ever let you down
No
I'm not trying to be somebody else
Don't you know me? I wont ever let you
I wont ever let you

What they say
What they know
What they think wont ever bring me down
This life is mine and I am my own

I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I lead
Don't you know me?

I'm trying to be somebody
I'm not trying to be somebody else
This life is mine I'm living
Don't you know me? I wont ever let you down
Yeahhh
I'm not trying to be somebody else
Don't you know me? I wont ever let you down
I wont be nobody else
This life is mine and I am my own
