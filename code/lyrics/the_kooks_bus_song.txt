Song:

Do do do...

You know today I stayed on the bus
Oh yeah I waited and waited until I was at your stop
The driver said to me just don't make a fuss
And I said in the end you've taken all my money, my friend

But ow ow, yes you love it as I take you on when you down
And ow ow, something happened and now I can't sing along
And ow ow, yes you hate it as I try to get under your skin
And ow ow, something happened and now you can't sing along

Do do do...

But you know today I stayed on the train
Oh yes I waited and waited until I could not refrain
The driver said to me just don't make a fuss like you did on the bus
In the end you've taken all my money, you're not my friend

But ow ow, yes you love it as you take me on when I'm down
And ow ow, something happened and now I can't sing along
And ow ow, yes you love it as you try to get under my skin
