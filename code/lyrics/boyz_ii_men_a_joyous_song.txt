Song:

Love over flows around this season
Our hearts find pleasure in the simplest of things
It brings joy to a child
When he sees all the decorations hanging all around
The birthday of our king
We sing praises to you
People gather around to see a tree
Light up the sky for all of the world to see
Of all the holidays that exist
None makes more happier than this one


Chorus:
I see love all around this world
In every man, woman, boy, and girl
The time is so right and I'll say
Thank you Lord
It's so great to be alive
Because it's all about love


As we sit around the fire place
Windows fill with snow as it flutters down and gives the ground a glow
I feel your kisses
Your warm embrace
Kneeling as we pray
To thank our Lord for what he's done for us
Time stands so still
As I touch your hand it says things to me words never will


I feel it (it's easy to feel) peace all the way inside
Joy from a stranger as he walks by and says
Hi, Merry Christmas to you and yours
May you receive everything you wish for and more
I see love


Chorus (repeats five times)
