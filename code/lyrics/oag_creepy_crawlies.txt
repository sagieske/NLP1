Song:

Creepy crawlies playing in my mind
When I can't get no satisfaction
Creepy crawlies fooling in my brain
When I can't get no full attention
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea

I felt so happy today
When I knew that you are coming to stay
With a happy shiny smile
Heading to mcds that sell us junk food

Then I felt so bore today
When I knew that you are going away
With a sad tone face
Heading to the bar that sell us mugs of drinks
Sell us jugs of drinks

Creepy crawlies growing in my mind
When I can't get no satisfaction
Creepy crawlies playing in my vein
When I get no full attention

I felt so happy today
When I knew that you are coming to stay
With a happy shiny smile
Heading to mcds that sell us junk food
Then I felt so bore today
When I knew that you are going away
With a mourn... Mourn soul
Heading to the bar that sell us mugs of drinks
Sell us jugs of drinks

Creepy crawlies blowing my mind
When I get no satisfaction
Creepy crawlies stuck in my brain
When I don't get no full attention
Creepy crawlies fooling my mind
Creepy crawlies full in my mind
Full in my mind
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
