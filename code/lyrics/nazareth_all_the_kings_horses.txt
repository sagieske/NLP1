Song:

I know you
You always rode so tall in the saddle
You are the answer
But I know that you are only causin trouble
Take all you want, leave me the rest behind
Youre a user
A winnin no new friends, just make one small step
Youre a user
You never came to anyones call
Spent all your life head on the wall
While you're up there, there's only one way to fall

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Will never put you together again

You still got your chances
The one thing the whole world loves is a winner
You can't walk on water
With your heat the ice you're on is gettin thinner
You used to be so wise
But you are fooled by your own lies
And I see right through your disguise

All the kings horses and all the kings men
Will never put you together again
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Will never put you together again.
