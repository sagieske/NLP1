Song:

You can't be what you were
So you better start being just what you are
You can't be what you were
Time is now and it's running out
You can't be what you were
So you better start living the life
That you're talking about
You can't be what you were
No movement, no movement, no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
