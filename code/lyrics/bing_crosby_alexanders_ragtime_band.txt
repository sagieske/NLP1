Song:

Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear, come on and hear 'bout the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call like you never heared before
So natural that you wanna go to war
That's just the bestest band what am, oh Honey Lamb

Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand
Up to the man, up to the man who's the leader of the band
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear (come on and hear), come on and hear (come on and hear)
Alexander's Ragtime Band!

Come on and hear (come on and hear), come on and hear (come on and hear)
Alexander's Ragtime Band
Come on and hear (well here I come), come on and hear (I'm standin' right here)
It's the best band in the land
They can play a bugle call like you never heared before
(whistle)
That's just the bestest band what am, oh Honey Lamb

Come on along (come on along), come on along (come on along)
Let me take you by the hand (here's my lilywhites)
Up to the man (the mighty man), I'm talkin' 'bout the man
Mmm, the leader of the band
And if you care to hear that Swanee River played in ragtime
Come on and hear (come on and hear), come on and hear (come on and hear)
Alexander's Ragtime Band

Alexander's Ragtime Band!
