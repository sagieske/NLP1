Song:

Mi amor Angelica
And I swear Angelica

Mi amor Angelica
You wear the sombrero now
And I swear Angelica
I'll be your caballero now

I don't know
If this is my love
It's even now or ever
Since I met you
I stop dreaming of
Someone than better than you

Surely I'm in love
No boubt about it, oh no
But much to my surprise
It means nothing to you

Mi amor Angelica
You wear the sombrero now
And I swear Angelica
I'll be your caballero now
Mi amor Angelica
Can't be a pistolero now
Like Don Juan Angelica
I wanna be your lover now

I don't get it
If this is my glory
To have you now or ever
But even now
As you se me this way
I never knock on a locked door

Mi amor Angelica...

Just wanna be your lover now

Uh Angelica
I love you

I'll find another girl
But not better than you oh no
Oh this could be an
Unforgettable life
Now I want you to now

Mi amor Angelica...

Now and forever
