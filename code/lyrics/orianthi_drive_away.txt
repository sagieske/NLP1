Song:

Baby when you looked at me
My world changed completely
You are the best thing
That is on my mind
Baby it's not hard to see
Why I fell in love so completely
You are the best thing that
I have in my life

I've got the time
I've got the place
I've got this love for you
At this moment, don't you feel it baby
I know that it's gonna be the same
Away somewhere

So I said to you
Baby let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby let's move tonight
It's the first day of the rest of our lives
Yeah I just wanna run away
Turn my back and erase all this pain now
So baby wouldn't it just be nice
To drive away and start again every time

Baby we were meant to be
I can see when we're together
That you are the only one
The only one for me
Baby when you take my hand
And we are on this road to forever
You are the best thing
That I have in my life

I've got the time
I've got the place
I've got this love for you
At this moment don't you feel it baby
I know that it's gonna be the same
Away somewhere

So I said to you
So baby let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby let's move tonight
It's the first day of the rest of our lives
Yeah I just wanna run away
Turn my back and erase all this pain now
Wouldn't it just be nice
To drive away and start again every time

So baby let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby let's move tonight

So baby let's drive away
And leave this place now for one day
So baby let's move tonight
It's the first day of the rest of our lives
Yeah I just wanna run away
Turn my back and erase all this pain now
Wouldn't it just be nice
To drive away and start again every time
