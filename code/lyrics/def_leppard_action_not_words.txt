Song:

I'm sick and tired of the damn tv
I'm gonna make my own movie
I wanna star in a late night show
Where all I need is my video
Shock me! Make it electric
Shock me! Make it last

Curtain up, let the camera roll
It's automatic, it's in control
Got no script baby, ain't no lines
Just me and you and a real good time

Oh shock me! Make it electric
Shock me! Make it last
Shock me! Gimme thunder 'n' lightning
Shock me! Oh babe I need it fast
Cause all I need is some

Action! Action! Action! Not words
Gimme action! Action! Action! Not words

C'mon and shock me, let the cameras roll

I'll be the hero, you be the star
With your wine and your caviar
No audition, a starring roll
I'll be your bogart and you be monroe, yeah

Shock me! Make it electric
Shock me! Oh bump and grind
Shock me! Make a night to remember
Shock me! Do it one more time

So cut me in on the action
Lights, camera, sound, I need action!

Action! Action! Action! Not words
Let the camera roll
Gimme action! Action! Action! Not words
I need a little
Action! Action! Action! Not words
Shake a little piece of your
Action! Action! Action! Not words
Come on, talk to me with your body

Action!
