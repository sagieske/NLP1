[Verse:]
These public pool, b*****s
Ain't really mermaids
Private beach Malibu, n***a!
Weave up in the shade
How do you, follow figure?
Yeah, you that other wave
She party pretty
She party plenty
It's like everyday
I commence
You to picture
It's a fantasea
You another
Picture licker
Off that tank of red
Okay, celebrate, let's celebrate
That aquababe, sash–π
Boulevard, Runway
B*****s, witness b*****s
They've been afraid
These nigga's b*****s be b*****s
They smelling the fish's eggs
She sell it bigger and bigger
Difference gave it all away
Seashells on my two ta-tas
See she got it up on display
Hooray!

[Verse 2:]
We knockin'
Got it poppin' like a parade
Your opinion is just a option
F****are what you say?
I'm looking like, I look like
N****s look away
Is it a problem?
Clap 'em, clock 'em, blam 'em
Every chopper spray
The ball like Madden
The trunk clunkin' everyday
I see you don't want that
Rusty, rowdy type, ok?
Okay, okay, huh?
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Okay, okay, huh?)
(Huh? Huh? Huh?)

[Verse 3:]
Cinnamon, gentlemen
What that connate?
I be killin' 'em, killin' 'em
Like murder everyday
When does it get
The abs on display?
I hit you, spit you
Lift you, dip you
Get up out the way
The n****s is swank
My b*****s is stank
All these chickens
Out for dollars
All they get is the franks
The linens is blank
The mendle is paint
He gon put that snorkel on
We gon dip in the tank
I focused
I floated out the bluest ocean
This smash on your set, honey?
Get this s**t in motion
B*****s is sick
These b*****s be opposing
B*****s see me
Yes, these b*****s be all open
You don't want it
No you don't really want it
I'm drownin' all on my haters
And surfin' the moment
(Swimming in all these people)
(b***h, surfin' homies)
(Swimming in all these people)
(b***h, surfin' homies)

[Verse 4]
The chitter-chatter
Don't really matter
You silly rabbit
That could get'cha
G-get'cha get'cha
Your carrot, sweat it
All linens, fabrics
I'm diving backwards
And livin' ravish
Aqua fancy
She get the fly s**t
Then dip it back in
Ha, ha
