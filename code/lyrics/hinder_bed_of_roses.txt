[Bon Jovi cover]

Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka
Still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
Think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up
And French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
It's own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love, the truth
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses

Well I'm so far away
Each step that I take's on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd give each night
To see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I just close my eyes and whisper,
Baby blind love is true

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

Well this hotel bar's hangover, whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked and
She's giving me the eye
Well I might have said yeah
But I's laugh so hard I think I'd die
Ooh yeah

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on bed of roses
