Song:

Imagine breathing in
Imagine leaving all your air behind
What matters in the end
A matter of opinion til' you find out
Life can only, mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is hardly settled in
[Chorus:]
They'll show you how to swim
They'll throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'l float
I won't float
I had a funny sleep
I didn't have a dream cuz' I don't believe in them
Life can only mean, hardly anything
All I'll ever be is hardly settled in
[Chorus:]
They'll show you how to swim
They'll throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'l float
I won't float
Float away then come right back to me
(2x)
[Chorus:]
They'll show you how to swim
They'll throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'l float
I won't float
What if I don't float
(2x)
I think I'll float
I'll float
I'll float away
