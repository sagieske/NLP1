Song:

1) I'm looking for something
Maybe for the answers for all the changes in my life
Searching for a feeling
And im trying to ride out the storms of my life


Chorus -
Love and soul, floating away
Time, be a friend to me...help me through this day


2) Waking alone and empty
But some would say I wished it on myself
Memories and illusions
This house is now free of your things and your smell


Chorus -
Friends with love, floating away
I really want to be a friend to you...to help you through this day


Bridge -
I can feel the sun
Blinding you with reality
The earth and stars in infinite sky sweeping us away
I can see it in your eyes


3) In my dream you were flying
In a capsule that was hurtling you through space
I kept trying to stop it
In the speed of the ship was a shadow of your face


Chorus -
Love and soul, doesnt't't have to float away
In time we'll be friends you'll see, i'm living day to day
