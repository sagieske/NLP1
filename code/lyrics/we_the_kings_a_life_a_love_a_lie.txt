Song:

When you were dealt an ace straight down, I was dressed in spades
According to the games that we played
So ante up I'm worth it all

Have you any time for self evaluation?
I suggest you find what you've been looking for

Don't lose your heart under the covers baby
Just like everyone you said you loved
Don't expect the doves to pick you from the ground
Because baby I've pinned them down one by one.

When you were slowly falling down, I was there to catch you
From the dark nights and lonely roads so listen up when I say

Have you any time for self evaluation?
I suggest you find what you've been looking for

Don't lose your heart under the covers baby
Just like everyone you said you loved
Don't expect the doves to pick you from the ground
Because baby I've pinned them down one by one.

I'm so lush addicted to your laugh,
Convicted by your smile that holds me back
Did you ever care about, what I cared about, did you ever care at all?

And don't expect the doves to carry on with you
Don't expect the doves to carry on what you have done

She sings "la da da da da, la da da da da da"
Baby just like everyone you said you loved
And don't expect the doves to carry on with you
Cause baby I've pinned them down one by one
