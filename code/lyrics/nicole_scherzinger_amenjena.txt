Song:

My love, I don't know where to start this
'Cause I don't know where it is
I wanna try and say things
I'll never have the courage to send

Baby believe me when I tell you
You have, made me a new heart
Remember us in Amenjena
If we could just go back to the start

'Cause I lost paradise in cryin'
I wanna be done lovin' you
But givin' up feels like I'm failin'
And that's just not what I do
Ohh if only it could be easy
Ohh if only this could be easy

It isn't fair, It isn't perfect
For me you've always been enough
And I know it's hard to see when you don't believe it
If you could just only trust

'Cause we have the sweetest California
Baby we were free, we just drove
Right off the cliff and now we're hanging
We just can't let go
Ohh if only it could be easy
Love, why can't it be easy

Why can't it be easy
Easy like when you shut me out
Why don't you fight for me
I'm losing myself
I'm just losing myself
Can anybody save us now
'Cause I don't know how, how, how

I see the sun, in the distance
Just keep on moving with the wind
Goodbye Geneva
Not going back there again

Ooh but don't you know I'd paint the skies for you
Blow it up in lights for you 
If that would make a change
I forgive the night we died
Bring Amenjena back to life
If that's only what it would take
If only it could be easy
Ooh love, why can't it be easy

Whatever it maybe 
Let's make it easy
Let's make it easy
Just make it easy
Baby easy
Easy
Easy
