Song:

You dream of a love
Which is pure, with no conditions
Strong, eternal as the sun
With which you draw a passion

You dream of a love
Which is clean, with devotion

Be free, spread the wings of the heart
And fly where passion nests

Chorus
Passion is like a restless wind
That turns into freedom
It is knowing that there's someone else who lives
Wishing to be able to find you
It is travelling with no fear through the stars and the immensity
It is crossing through fire, walking on waters
Making dreams come true
Passion is that great force
Which moves all creation
It is knowing that someone is waiting for you
Beyond that place where the sun sets
It is forever erasing the word loneliness
It is two souls that join together to reach eternity

You will never need
Someone in whom to trust

An angel who will take your hand
And will lead you to discover a world of passion

(Repeat chorus)

You live with a love
That is strong and with no conditions
Be free and put wings to your heart
Fly where passion nests
