[Fabolous (Fab) (Dj Clue):]
Ladies and Gentlmen
Its my pleasure to present to you (My pleasure) (Yeaaa, Yeaaa)
Street Family (Ah Ha, Ah ha!)

Street Fam, that Street Fam (Woo Woo)
It's the realest that you've ever seen (New Fabolous, Paul Cain)

And ya'll know who I be right? (Come, On!)
Lo, Lo, Lo Lo Lo Loso (Yea!)
Lo, Lo, Lo, Lo Lo Loso
Lo, Lo, Lo, Lo Lo Loso (Wooooooooooo!)

It wont stop, until I do the numbers I'm suppose to
And my accountant got as many numbers as a social
With a beach house that's, somewhere on the coast to
Bunch of bad b*****s that some of ya'll propose to (Clue clue!)
I hear ni***z talk, dummer then they suppose to
A brotha leak, like a plumber aint suppose to
Ride this clean yea, summers gonna appose you,
Please don't make me be the someone that expose you, (Word Word!)
I snatch yea kids, or someone that you close to,
Then the body parts start coming in the postal,
Summers getting close to, gotta go drop,
I gotta slow bop in the proda low tops,
My domicanna sell out a co-op,
She also can suck the gum outta blow pop, (Woo!)
The feds wanna talk to my accountant to,
They heard I bottle green like mountain dew,
Too many rocks to be countin boo,
The globe look like the one in the Scarface fountain do
But they can't take the ayto (Nah!), point blank will open yea face, (Nah)
Till I'm white like a baked patatoe
And I'm not new at this,
I'm on the jet, but aint nothing change but the pilot line and the studarist (Ah ha, Ah ha!)
A guy in fur, continental flying spur,
You might wanna keep an eye on her, (Clue clue!)
Theres no question amuse**
Before I have her in s** positions, that look like wrestling moves, (Damn)
Get some chest shots, coming my way
Believe me (Yea!) yea best not stop at my gate, (Yea!)
3 cars, the rest** lot in the drive way, (Yea!)
You know I got rest spots like a high way (Yeaa!)(Ah Ha)
And mid-town, the loft cost big,
The jersey, back-yard is golf course big (uhh huh)
Brooklyn, Miss Jade, and of course big
After that its me, F-A-B... You knowww (ah ha ah ha!)
Now what you know about chauffers (huh?)
The roof tucked in like a fold out sofa (woo!)
Its more heat when I spray off rhymes
The prices is up like floor seats at playoff time,
You Feel Me?

[Paul Cain (Paul) (Dj Clue):]
Chea (Yea Yea)
Hey Yo Fab I got these ni***z (Come On!)

This s**t don't stop until the cribs like Madison square
5 in's in income is what I average a year,
Poppin corks, not the real talk but Fab in a leer,
Right now, I'm dead close I aint braggin I swear, (Ah ha, Ah ha)
Cause I'm a hustler, I eat like I'm suppose,
Fab taught me to watch people, mainly the leechs and the hoes,
I'm the long end beefin with my foes, and the chicks freakin after shows sippin peach and different flows,
I even taught my young boys to speak to me in code,
Cause its hard to tell, which ni***z leakin to the po's (Yea Yea!)
These boys in the hood, wanna creep me and I knows,
Just said a couple sandles would keep me on my toes
So I travel with the meanest cause the last two bodies that drop
Those ni***z walk around the hood like ballerinas,
From the scurviest I learned that the wrachet in the beamer (What!)
Calm my n***a down with the saddest look to meaner
I would be damned if that aint true
Talking reckless on smack when, we all not that aint you, (Aww Noo)
N***a you actin out of character, reading from a movie script,
Cross me, and Imma have to do you from the uzi grip
Your s***s hilarious, you think you gonna fool me prick, (huh?)
You a fraud, I know the clown ni***z you be with,
They don't draw guns, they draw sketches for the jake,
And I know know? The diamonds in dem neckless' is fake, (Clue clue!)
And I'm known over sea's but respected in the states,
Ask clue, but I'm gonna throw the heckle in yo face, fuckin snakes, chea

[Dj Clue:]
Yea mannnn... Yea Man

Hes a Hustler! Hes a Hustler.. Part!... Part one

Ya'll see Me
