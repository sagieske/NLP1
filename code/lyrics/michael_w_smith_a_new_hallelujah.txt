Song:

Can you hear, there's a new song
Breaking out from the children of freedom
Every race and every nation
Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah

Let us sing love to the nations
Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us
Make Him known and make Him famous
Sing it out sing to the new Hallelujah

Chorus
Arise
Let the church Arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song Arise

Africa sings a new song
Reaching out with the new Hallelujah
Every son and every daughter
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah

Chorus
Arise
Let the song Arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song Arise

Bridge
Whoa whoa yeah (2x)
Let the song arise(2x)
Let the song arise yeah (2x)

Spoken
Let the world sing a new Hallelujah
From Africa to Australia
From Brazil to China
From New York down to Houston!

Chorus
Arise
Let the church Arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song Arise

Everyone sing a new Hallelujah (2x)
