Song:

It was all those
Things you said to me
It was all those lies
You believed in
I guess that now you
Stand higher than
Anyone els in this world

So fragile that
It's hard to touch you
So pure and so beautiful
It was all so hard to see
Or I was too blind to be

Killing me in your heart
Love is gone
The deepest touch
And all is done
All is done

It was all
So beautiful
It was all
So bright and true
My eyes are staring at you
Watching it all
Go wrong

Killing me in your heart
Love is gone
The deepest touch
And all is done
All is done
