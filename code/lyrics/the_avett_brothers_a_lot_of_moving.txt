Song:

A lot of movin', A lot of rollin'
A lot of drivin', A lot of strollin'
A lot of leavin' here
A lot of arrivin' there
Trying to go just about everywhere
A lot of thinking about where I'm going next

If I's a police
I couldn't catch me
Because I'm always up and ready
A lot of chasin' here
Escapin' there
Blue lights flashin' 'round everywhere
A lot of woo-ooo where am I going next

A lot of movin', A lot of rollin'
A lot of drivin', A lot of strollin'
A lot of leavin' here
A lot of arrivin' there
Trying to go just about everywhere
A lot of thinking about where I'm going next

Country to my left side
Country to my right side
City to my left side
City on my right side
Banjos and back seats
Side roads and side streets
Well if you wanna stay for dinner
I'll throw my suitcase in the river
A lot of drinkin' here
And drinkin' there
I'll play and sing just about any damn where
A lot of thinkin' about where I'm going next

A lot of movin', A lot of rollin'
A lot of drivin', A lot of strollin'
A lot of leavin' here
A lot of arrivin' there
Trying to go just about everywhere
A lot of thinking about where I'm going next
