Song:

Romans, Chapter 8 and Verse 18 says
'For I reckon that the sufferings
Of this present time are not worthy
To be compared with the glory
Which shall be revealed in us', listen

I asked myself how did He do it
Made such a sacrifice
And the ones that He loved
Wanted Him crucified

And He knew that His friends would betray Him
And He knew that His blood would be shed
He could have burned someone else in His place
But instead He said amen

Amen, I surrender
Amen, not my will but Yours
Amen, I'll lift my hands and say amen

So I looked at my test and trials
They can't compare to His pain
And if He can go through it
Surely I can do the same

Oh Lord, I bless You for all of the bad
And I bless You for all of the good
And the place where I stand
You have already stood

Amen, never the less, amen
Amen, I don't understand what it meant
Amen, Lord, I surrender, amen

My soul say amen
Amen, this is not about me, Lord
Amen, but all about Your will Lord
Amen, amen

Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, oh
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, oh

Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
