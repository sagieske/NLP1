Song:

Pay close attention
Or else you'll miss what's happening
We worship the sun
Yet we burn it's rays
So we seek out the dark
So we seek out the shade
It's such a mix of emotions
We call it regret
Chaotic patterns unfold
It's such an elegant mess
So I'll embrace the pain
It's time to face all my fears
I've had enough of this game
Oh how it brings me to tears
And I can only be sure
One day I won't be alive
Stepping into the future
With the brightest of eyes
Let time stand still
For one second please just stop
Oh my
It's frightening
It's right in front of my eyes
Oh my
It's right there
It's right in front of my eyes
Wake up from the nightmare
And become the dream
That you've always been
That you've always seen
Wake up from the nightmare
Because you are the dream
I stand tall grounded here on this earth
I'm loooking up at the sky
With the stars in my eyes, I'm alive
I'm looking up at the sky
I see life was my dream all along
I'm looking up at the sky
My self
My world
My people
My home
My everything
