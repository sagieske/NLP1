Song:

Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Seems to me like I'm just scared of ever feeling it again
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
It's not that easy

I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
But I only got myself to blame for it, and I accept the now
It's time to let it all go, go out and start again
But it's not that easy

But I've got high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooohhh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning around

And in my dreams, I make the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
My evil is just staring at the barrel of a gun
And I do believe in

Believe I've got high hopes
It takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooohhh when it all comes to an end
But the world keeps spinning
And the world keeps spinning around

High hopes, it takes me back to when we started
High hopes, when you let it go, go out and start again
High hopes, ooohhh
And the world keeps spinning
Yeah this world keeps spinning
How this world keeps spinning around
