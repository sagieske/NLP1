Song:

In the desert of my shame
I have found myself to blame.
Now I thirst for innocence,
And your blood is there to quench.
Pour your life into my soul,
Let the cleansing waters flow,
Make me white as snow.

Hear me as I pray, wash my sins away,
Drown me in your grace, baptize me.
As my lips confess, fill this emptiness
With your holiness; baptize me.

Touch my eyes and give me sight.
Father, bathe me in your light.
At your feet I'll always be
Until the day your face I see.
Let your words consume my heart,
Lead me to the deepest part
And the healing starts.

Hear me as I pray, wash my sins away,
Drown me in your grace, baptize me.
As my lips confess, fill this emptiness
With your holiness; baptize me.

Hear me as I pray, (a-ay) wash my sins away, (a-ay)
Drown me in your grace, baptize me.
As my lips confess, (a-ay) fill this emptiness (a-ay)
With your holiness; baptize me.

[spoken:]
There is a river of life flowing from the throne of god
There is one who came by water and blood.
There is the spirit who testifies to this.
Anyone who believes in the son has this testimony in his heart.
Behold the lamb of god, who washes away the sins of the world
Baptize me.

Hear me as I pray, wash my sins away,
Drown me in your grace, baptize me.
As my lips confess, fill this emptiness
With your holiness; baptize me.

Hear me as I pray, (a-ay) wash my sins away, (a-ay)
Drown me in your grace, baptize me.
As my lips confess, (a-ay) fill this emptiness (a-ay)
With your holiness; baptize me. (a-ay)

Oh, hear me as I pray, wash my sins away,
Drown me in your saving grace,
Baptize me, baptize me, baptize me, baptize me.
