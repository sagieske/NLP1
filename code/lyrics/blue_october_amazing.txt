Song:

How am I supposed to breathe?
I try to relax. I touch your still frame
So I can watch you closer
And study the ways I believe I belong to you, to you
So I scratch at your waist line... Your doll hair
I dig up the thought of how your eyes glow
So I make you my religion, my collision, my escape goat
So have I found your secret weak spot, baby?

[Chorus:]
Can you pretend I'm amazing?
I can pretend I'm amazing...
Instead of what we both know
Instead of what we both know
I cut to the punch line baby
Can we pretend I'm amazing
Instead of what we both know

Now our history is for sale
And for that I apologize
You see you're my only know how
The study of when I believed I belonged to you, to you
You see I've made you into something more delicious,
My sweet ghost
So have I found your secret weak spot, baby?

[Chorus:]
