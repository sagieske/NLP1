Song:

You look at me and wonder
If I'll go under or give you love you need
Will stars always be in heaven?
I'm only guessin' as far as I can see

I could never give up loving the sun
How could I deny such a perfect one?

So, when you want the time, dear
I have to spend here, I'll gladly share with you
My life as far as I imagined
There would be passion if only you stay close

I could never give up wanting to fly
What's a bird in flight without any sky?

You make me smile, it's been a while
Since I felt this way, won't you stay?

Your kiss so light as a feather, pull me together
And I'm a stormy sea
So, shall I ask my question, just a suggestion
Won't you just give your love to me?

My love, make it magic
It would be tragic if you let go of me
I know all the things that sadden could never end
If only you stay close to me
