[Hook:]
Okay cool, okay bool I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi 'fore I f****d her mother
I passed them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I f**k I gotta hit me least like 2 b*****s
Boy that dope get whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside that b***h got 2 digits
Money stand like 8 feet just like 2 midgets

[Verse:]
Who the f**k told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't f**k off the bean
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No I'm not Nipsey, not from la, but I got keys to the city
I f**k it, I suck it, I beat it down then she beat me to the ceiling
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm living too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Hades' style
Plus I just seen Snoop's girl goin' wild
I just bought a Bentley and a b***h came with it
Young rich n***a hittin' million dollar licks
Ballin' in New York like the mot*****in' Knicks
You better have them racks you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I pass like a staff
I'm goin' off top like a mot*****in' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left 10 bands in a mu'fu***n' cab

[Hook:]
Okay cool, okay bool I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi 'fore I f****d her mother
I passed them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I f**k I gotta hit me least like 2 b*****s
Boy that dope get whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside that b***h got 2 digits
Money stand like 8 feet just like 2 midgets

[Verse 2:]
I just wanna go and run my money up and everybody did it
All these n****s p***y n****s, tellin' on they partner
Hope the p***y n***a get a bigger sentence
P***y n***a play, I'm comin' back with the K
And I'mma shoot that m**********are 'til he livid
B***h you wanna see a n***a thumb throw it fast
I'mma never sell Young Thug attendance
100 bands in no time
I fronted you back but you-
I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy
I f**k my bitches' buddies
I just won't nut like Buddy
All of my b*****s buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the n****s dogs going, "Woof!"
Top notch shawty, n***a we ain't gon' care
Young n***a rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that b***h is only average
I can't even hear ya baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a b***h, but I learn mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she follows patterns

[Hook:]
Okay cool, okay bool I love her
I'mma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'mma call my papi 'fore I f****d her mother
I passed them a molly, now they kiss each other
Every time I f**k I gotta hit me least like 2 b*****s
Boy that dope get whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside that b***h got 2 digits
Money stand like 8 feet just like 2 midgets
