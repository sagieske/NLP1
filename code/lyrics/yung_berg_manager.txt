I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend, lemme manage ya

[Verse 1: Yung Berg]
Yeah, these girls like me cause I show em somethin icy
Roll Somethin nicely
Make her wanna have a seed, Hope her son looks like me
Uh, can't imagine the things that I'm fightin
Collipark on the drums, I kno you gon like it
Chi-Town swag with a A-Town bounce
Mix in all in together Watch a hit drop out
See we started from the kitchen, from the bed,
To the couch
Gave her 45 minutes I was In
Then I'm Out
See my mama say I'm lucky
The hood say they love me
These girls (hate the part how I?) Put no one above me
See now I'm livin lovely
My Girl Gotta buddy
But she be trippin out because her girls wanna f**k me
And now we pullin up, see
Me and the boy Lloyd
Redbone (Girls)
Lambourghini (Toys)
Take it to tha flo, Cause I kno how to handle ya
I ont wanna be ya man I wanna be ya manager

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Kno I'm hot, let the top down if you burnin up
Speakers Knockin the block down wen we pullin up
I see you movin around on the dance floor
Baby watcha doin here watcha mad for
Shawty you jus don't kno what you do to me
Gotta Playa open hopin you don't make a fool of me
Ya picture frame belongs inside of my camera
I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend lemme manage ya (she make me wanna say)

[Bridge:]

[Verse 2:]

Forget about your boyfriend mami he's a amateur
There go the paparazzi smile for the camera (ahh)
Say cheese and throw up the yb'z (Yb'z)
Body Picture perfect

Only for a small fee cause your managed by me
Started with (rosade?) then took it to Don P
Ran outta Don P so we vous (vecliz?)
See them otha dudes lose cause they ain't smoove like me
They don't coordinate the jewels with the shoes like me
True Religion Jeans with a v-neck fee
Make ya best friend say she want a dude like me (Like Meeee)
So we took em both to the beach (to the beach)
Me and the boy Lloyd (boy Lloyd) Threw em on Jet Skis (Skiiiis)
Then to the suite cause I know how to handle ya
I ont wanna be ya boyfriend lemme manage ya

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Kno I'm hot, let the top down if you burnin up
Speakers Knockin the block down wen we pullin up
I see you movin around on the dance floor
Baby watcha doin here watcha mad for
Shawty you jus don't kno what you do to me
Gotta Playa open hopin you don't make a fool of me
Ya picture frame belongs inside of my camera
I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend lemme manage ya (she make me wanna say)
