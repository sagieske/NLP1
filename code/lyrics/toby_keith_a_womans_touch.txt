Song:

Lately I've been lookin' through the windows of my soul
And I can see there's not much left to hold
Just an empty space surrounded by the pieces of
A badly broken heart that's forgotten how to love

What my heart needs is a woman's touch
A tender hand to fix it up
Its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
What my heart needs is a woman's touch

When I look in the mirror, the only thing I see
Are traces of the man I used to be
Late at night I hear it, it cannot be denied
A lonely voice is crying out from somewhere deep inside

What my heart needs is a woman's touch
A tender hand to fix it up
Its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
What my heart needs is a woman's touch

What my heart needs is a woman's touch
A tender hand to fix it up
Its rough and ragged edges sure could use some love
What my heart needs is a woman's touch

Yeah, it's rough and ragged edges
Sure could use some love
What my heart needs is a woman's touch

What my poor heart needs is a woman's touch
A woman's touch
