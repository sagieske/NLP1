Song:

(Bowie)

To meet her once just to know it through and through
I know, I know
But it ain't finished till the fat lady sings
I know, I know

How can I help you?
You're just a wanna-be
I'm a believer
You're a s** receiver
And me with a big hurt
You know I had a big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
'Cause you're my roommate
From hell

Chorus
Got to take some blows on the stepping stones
Speak in extremes
It'll save you time
You were a saint abroad
But a devil at home
Come on here, woo-woo
And kiss it for me

To meet her once just to know it
Through and through
I know, I know
Even a glass eye
In a duck's a**
Can see that

I know, I know

How can I help you?
I'm hit with a big hurt
You know I had
A great big hurt
From the very start
I'm hurting so bad
And here come the indians oooo

Chorus

Kiss it for me, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Woo-woo, kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
Kiss it where it counts
Kiss it for me
Come on here, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo
Kiss it for me
