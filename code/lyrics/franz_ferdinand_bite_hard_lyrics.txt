Song:

You don't know I
Sing these songs
About you
You don't know the Pseudonyms I assume
You don't know the Pseudonyms I assume
For you

Are you happier now
That the gods are dying?
Or do you dream of
Heston with omniscient beard

You should be happier now,
With no one to pray to
Or would you love to
Break your knees from beggin and praying?

Bite Hard
It's a broken smile,
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their minds
Bite Hard
It's 5. 05, your engine's alive and
We ride together
Bite Hard
Bite Hard

I may be lonelier now
But I'm happy alone - honest
It ain't lonely alone
What would we talk about anyway?

No I never resort
To kissing your photo - honest
I just had to see
How the chemicals taste their honey
Bite Hard

It's a broken smile,
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their minds
Bite Hard

Well it's 5. 05, your engine's alive and
We ride together
We ride together
We die together

Bite hard
Bite hard
Bite hard

I never
No I never
I just had to
I just had to
See now honey
Bite hard
It's a broken smile,
That's breaking their hearts
And breaking their minds
We ride together
We die together
