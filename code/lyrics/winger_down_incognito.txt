Song:

---------------------
Days undercover
All out of sync
Haven't paid the rent
Even talking in my sleep
My monkey's M.O.
Is all out of commission
I'm waiting for a good
old-fashioned cure
For my condition
'Cos I'm all out of charm
And I'm all out of money
Hanging
Down Incognito
Waiting for the sun to shine
Fools to the left
Jokers to the right
Waitin' for the rest of us
To come and take a bite
But I'll wait it out
Call it superstition
I'll be fine for now
Just reminiscing
(Repeat Chorus)
I just had to let it go
Took all the pennies I had
Threw 'em in the wishing well
And I wish you well
Days undercover
All out of sync
Haven't paid the rent
Even talking in my sleep
My monkey's M.O.
Is all out of commission
I'm waiting for a good
old-fashioned cure
For my condition
(Repeat Chorus)
Me and my amigos
Down Incognito
