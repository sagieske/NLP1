Verse 1
You got A minute for your son father
I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin to run father
Lets take A walk
I'm so sorry for are what I've done father
It aint my fault
The devils been on my back lately
Its like A hawk
You never give us more than we can handle
But its getting hard
And I'm A strong individual
But I need you god
Love the things that I used to
I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to
I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for you one day
Up in there like hallelu ya on sunday
I thank you lord for the blessing that you gave me
And for my life with the blessings you have saved me
And for my wife you have carried me enough times and thatS the truth
Married me the rough times, throuout my youth
And thru it all I saw that you were still with me
I was that one lost sheep and you was coming to get me
Chorus
Lord you got me like
Oooohhh
Your love got me like
Ooooohhhh (2X)
Verse 2
I look at life A little different now
Since you hugged me
And I always love my people
That's why they love me
Thank you for the love lord
We praise you
Jacobs decendants form africa to asia
Bleeding the blood for christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it thru the night
And well shout your name in times of need
And times of joy
And when we bleed
And when we are over come with greed
You aint gonna have to tell me twice, I'm gonna take heed
And because of what you given me, I know youll deliver me
And I wont drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strenght I never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me I twas bad
All praises due to yo
That's why I had to dedicate something new to you
Thank you father
Chorus
Lord you got me like
Oooohhh
Your love got me like
Ooooohhhh (2X)
Verse 3
I never knew A love like this before
Messin with the thug life I missed it all
Opened up the doors and let me in
Down for the cause so lets begin
Prayers that you give to me I give to them
Same way you live in me, I live in them
Life is A blessing now
You got me smiling from inside of my heart
When inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore
I really love mine
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life the whole thirty years
You know that one day ill speak the word
You know that when I do I will be heard
You know that you gave me A permenant smile
And you know this father because I'm your child
Chorus
Lord you got me like
Oooohhh
Your love got me like
Ooooohhhh (2X
