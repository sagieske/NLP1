Song:

Bleeding on the radio

I see the feeling flashing and eye
Awake the frequency of your life
Put back what you take
Make up what you break
Or watch the tv burn the sky

Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Don't you ever take it
No
Now im bleeding on the radio

I need a vision to run away
From htis world we live in today
Put back what you take
Make up what you break
Or watch the tv burn the sky

Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Don't you ever take it
No
Now im bleeding on the radio

Pull the lever
Fight forever
Dynamite a hole in the sky
Humming on you
Comming on through
Over in the flash of an eye
Don't you ever close your eyes
Coz it gets you every time
Waking up to make a sign
On the Radio Yeah

Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Don't you speak your mind
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radioooooo
The radio
Bleeding on the radio

Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
Bleeeeeeding on the radio
