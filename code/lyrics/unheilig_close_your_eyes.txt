Song:

I softly touch your silken hair
My hand is cool you're unaware
You feel the force move deep under your skin

Clsoe your eyes
And let your light shine on me
Don't be afraid
I'll show you a place you've never seen
Saying goodbye to the world
The house of love burning down

I touch your old grey hair
You hear me voice everywhere
I've lost my way in time once again
No-one's prepared for this
The final magical kiss
The liberty you can't resist, you're free

And I say close your eyes
And let your light shine on me
Don't be afraid
I'll show you a place you've never seen
Saying goodbye to the world
The house of love burning down

I'm the door for you to heaven
I'm your window over hell
No remission for your sin

And I say close your eyes
And let your light shine on me
Don't be afraid
I'll show you a place you've never seen
Saying goodbye to the world
The house of love burning down
