Song:

Cry Me a River
Now you say you're lonely
You cry the long night thro'
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For bein' so untrue
Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me nearly drove me
Out of my head
While you never she'd a tear
Remember? I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebian
Told me you were thro' with me, an'
Now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on an' cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me nearly drove me
Out of my head
While you never she'd a tear
Remember? I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebian
Told me you were thru with me, an'
Now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on an' cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
