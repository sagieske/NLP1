Song:

This Isn't... 
This Is... Ooh

I Love Hard Love
When You Put, Put A Gun On My Heart
I Just Gotta Say Hey
I Just Gotta Say Hey.

I've Always Loved Hard
So I Take It Slow
I Guess Is My Fault 'Cause I Wanna Go
But I, Always Care For You
My... Perfect Not Even Close
But I Don't Deserve This
But Girl I Suppose
I Wasn't There For You

Pre Chorus:
... Baby We're Nothing Else To Say
Look Me In My Place I Can't Live Out This Way
Can't Live Out This Way
Can't Live Out This Way
You Put It... In My Heart
... Start Just A Little... Just A Little... 
Dance... I Bleed.

2 X Chorus:
When I Bleed, I Bleed Out
When I Cry, I Cry Loud
When I Love... 
When You Leave I Bleed Out.

I Look In Those Eyes
There's Nothing There
I'm Looking Into
The Cold Is There
I, Ever See
We Haven't Touched Each Other Forever
Know What I Do, If We're Not Together
I'm Not Ready To Leave, No Baby.

Pre Chorus:
... Baby We're Nothing Else To Say
Look Me In My Place I Can't Live Out This Way
Can't Live Out This Way
Can't Live Out This Way
You Put It... In My Heart
... Start Just A Little... Just A Little... 
Dance... I Bleed.

2 X Chorus:
When I Bleed, I Bleed Out
When I Cry, I Cry Loud
When I Love... 
When You Leave I Bleed Out.

Hey I Look
Why You Wanna Out A Gun In My Heart
I Just Gotta Say Hey
I Just Gotta Say Hey

[Chorus:]
