Song:

"Well there's a lot of things working against me
But I know I can't lose
Yeah there's a lot of things working against me
But I know I can't lose
And there's a lot of miles still between me and my home
But I've learned a lot through the years, now
I'm more than just young
I got a lot of things working against me
But I know I can't lose

And there's a lot of love locked up inside of me
That I'm learning to give
Yeah there's a lot of love locked up inside of me
That I'm learning to give
So that like that bush in Sinai that burned but was not consumed
May the speed of my life throw sparks on the shadows of the tombs
I got a lot of love locked up inside me
I'm learning to give

So hold on to my hand yeah hold on to my hand
'Cause I need a place to run to and a place to stand

And there's a lot of things this world has hidden
That I'm learning to see
Yeah there's a lot of things this world has hidden
That I'm learning to see
Well I have seen some injustice but I've seen mercy too
I was blinded by the things I saw until I looked at you
There's a lot of things this world has hidden
I'm learning to see

So hold on to my hand hold on to my hand
'Cause I need a place to run to and a place to stand

Hold on to my hand yeah hold on to my hand
'Cause I need a place to run to and a place to stand "
