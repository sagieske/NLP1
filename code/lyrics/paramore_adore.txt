Song:

I don't mean to run.
But every time you come around,
I feel more alive, than ever.
And I guess it's too much,
Maybe we're too young.
And I don't even know what's real,
But I know I never...

Wanted anything so bad,
I've never wanted anyone so bad.

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored.
Would you go all the way,
Be the one I'm looking for.
If I let you love me (If I Say),
Be the one adored (It's ok).
Would you go all the way (You can stay),
Be the one I'm looking for.

Help me come back down,
From high above the clouds.
You know I'm suffocating, But I blame this town,
Why do I deny.
The things that burn inside,
Down deep I'm barely breathing.
But you just see a smile.

And I don't wanna let this go,
Really I just want to know.

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored.
Would you go all the way,
Be the one I'm looking for.
If I let you love me (If I Say),
Be the one adored (It's ok).
Would you go all the way (You can stay),
Be the one I'm looking for.

If I let you love me,
Be the one adored.
Would you go all the way,
Be the one I'm looking for (x2).

If I let you love me (If I Say),
See the one adored (It's ok).
Would you go all the way (You can stay),
Be the one I'm looking for.
