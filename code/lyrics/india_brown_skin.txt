Song:

Brown skin you know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then

Where are your people from maybe Mississippi or an island?
Apparently your skin has been kissed by the sun
You make me wanna Hershey's kiss your licorice
Everytime I see your lips it makes me think of honey coated chocolate
Your kisses are worth more than gold to me
I'll be your almond joy, you'll be my sugar daddy

Brown skin you know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then

Everytime you come around something magnetic pulls me and I can't get out
Disoriented I can't tell my up from down all I know is that I want to lay you down
Everytime I let you in abra cadabra magic happens as we swim
Higher and higher finally we reach heaven
Come back to earth and then we do it all again

Brown skin you know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then

Skin so brown lips so round baby how can I be down
Beautiful mahogany you make me feel like a queen
Tell me what's that thing you do that makes me want to get next to you

Brown skin you know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then
