Song:

Ages and ages ago
(Gene Autry - Fred Rose - Ray Whitley)
" Â© '57 Western Music "
I remember when I made you cry ages and ages ago
I'll never blame you for our last goodbye ages and ages ago
Someone came along and took my place how wrong I was to let you go
And though it happened only yesterday it seems like ages and ages ago
(Something told me when you walked away that time would make me miss you so)
And though it happened only yesterday it seems like ages and ages ago
