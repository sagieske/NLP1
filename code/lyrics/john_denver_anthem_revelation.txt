See the sun rise
Open up your eyes
Today is the very first day
Watch the morning come
Now the night is gone
Yesterday's so very far away

Trouble you get out of my sight
You know I can't look at you
When the sun is so bright
You know everything's coming together now can't you see

And I live my life in celebration
That I've got a life to live
And I sing my song in revelation
That I've got a song that I can give to you
And you know I do

La la la

I was blind now I can see
You know I'm just learning how it feels to be free
You know I never really knew just what it could be
Before

And I live my life in celebration
That I've got a life to live
And I sing my song in revelation
That I've got a song that I can give to you
And you know I do
And you know it's true

La la la
