Song:

Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air.
Feather canyons everywhere

I've looked at clouds that way.
Now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone.
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way.

I've looked at clouds from both sides now.
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all.

Moons and Junes and faris wheels.
The dizzy, dancing way you feel
When every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way.

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away.

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all.

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud.
Dreams and scheams and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way.

But now old friends are acting strange.
They shake their heads
They say I've changed.
Well somethings lost and somethings gained
In living every day.

I've looked at life from both sides now
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's lifes illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow.
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all.

I really don't know life at all.
