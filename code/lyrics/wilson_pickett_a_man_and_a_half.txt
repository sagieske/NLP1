Song:

Let me tell you baby, I sure know how to please a woman, yes I do now
Now I can make you feel better than you've ever felt before, yes I can now
Now when I start lovin', women hate for me to stop
A whole lot of men envy me for what I've got
Ow! I'm a man & a half; that's what I am, a man & a half

Now look here
When I walk, the birds & the bees stop lovin' & look at me now, look here
When I talk, the whole wide world listen to my words, huh
I'm a man like any other man, I say without a doubt
Wow, what makes me different is the hand that knocks women out
I'm a man & a half; I'm trapped up in one; no brash, just facts

Only once in a lifetime a man like me comes along
Shakespeare wrote poems about me even before I was born
Thunder gave me a lift & lightnin' knocked on your door
Your chance in a lifetime, woman, might not have a number
To be loved by a man and a half, hey that's what I am, look here
A man, a camel went across the desert & there was no one in sight
Let me tell y'all one thing: the camel died tryin'
But your man & a half is here lovin' you tonight
Good God, I'm a man & a half, a man (shouting)
... & fade
