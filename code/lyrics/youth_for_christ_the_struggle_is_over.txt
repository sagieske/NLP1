Song:

Wherever you are
Whatever you've been going through
God says the struggle is over for you
You've been in this place long enough
And your mountainside has been rough
The struggle is over for you

Wherever you are
Whatever you've been going through
God says the struggle is over for you
You've been in this place long enough
And your mountainside has been rough
The struggle is over for you

The struggle is over
The struggle is over for you
The struggle is over
The struggle is over for you

The struggle is over
The struggle is over for you
The struggle is over
The struggle is over for you

Your heartache is over
Your heartache is over
Your heartache is over
Your heartache is over

The trouble is over
The trouble is over
The trouble is over
The trouble is over

Your struggle is over
Your struggle is over
Your struggle is over
Your struggle is over
Your struggle is over for you

You've been in this place long enough
And your mountainside has been rough
The struggle is over for you

I've been in this place long enough
And my mountainside has been rough
The struggle is over for me

You've been in this place long enough
And your mountainside has been rough
The struggle is over for you
