Song:

Fight!
You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years
But couldn't reach the next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me.
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see.
(Ohhh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be.
(Ohhh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on 
The line, so I expect nothing less from you.
I speak the truth and everybody else knows it,
So set your ego to the side and just get the f**k over it.
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you.
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to.
(Ohhh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be.
(Ohhh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on 
The line, so I expect nothing less from you.
I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist.
Alright. Hey, hey!
Still got something left to say.
Only one in the world that I depend on is me.
I need nothing from no one; I take what I need.
Get a hold on yourself, and keep away from me.
(Ohhh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight outta mind is what you'll always be.
(Ohhh!) I hold my cards to my chest. I laid my life on 
The line, so I expect nothing less from you.
