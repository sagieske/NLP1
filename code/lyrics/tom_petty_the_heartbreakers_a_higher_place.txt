Song:

We Gotta get to a higher place
And we gotta leave by night.
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find somewhe re that's dry
We gotta run like we never run,
Or we're gonna lose the light.
If we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody, can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together.
We gotta get to a higher place
If we wanna survive the weather

Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody, can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more

We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive togeth er.
We gotta get to a higher place
If we wanna survive the weather

I remember walking with her in town,
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again
When I add up what I've left behind
I don 't want to lose no more
But if we don't get to a higher place and
Find somebody, can help somebody,
Might be nobody no more
