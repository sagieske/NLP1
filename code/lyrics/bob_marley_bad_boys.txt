UH! Bad boys watcha gon, watcha gon, watcha gonna do?
When sheriff john brown come for you?
Tell me! Whatcha gonna do? When they come for you?

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

When you were eight and you had bad traits you go to school
And learn the golden rule, So why are you acting like a bloody fool
If you get hot then you must get cool!

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

You chuck it on that one,
You chuck it on this one,
You chuck it on ya mother,
And ya chuck it on ya father,
Ya chuck it on ya brother,
And ya chuck it on ya siter,
You chuck it on that one and you chuck it on Me!

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

Nobody naw give ya no Break,
Police naw give you no break,
And no Soldierman naw give you no break,
Not even you idren naw give you no break

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
(When they come for you?)

Why did you have to act so mean?
Don't you know you're a human being?
Born of a mother with the love of a father,
Reflexion comes and reflexion goes,
I know sometimes you wanna let go
Hehehe I know sometimes you wanna let go

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

You're too bad,
You're too rude,
You're too bad,
You're too rude,

Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do?
When they come for you?
Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

You chuck it on that one,
You chuck it on this one,
You chuck it on ya mother,
And ya chuck it on ya father,
Ya chuck it on ya brother,
And ya chuck it on ya siter,
You chuck it on that one and you chuck it on Me!
