Song:

She's here, Mr. Johnson
Ok, thank you very much

Granny, they're expecting you
You're a little late
So come right this way
Step right in, okay

What, say it now
(Yes) say it now, yeah

Me and the Ohio Players
Gonna tell you bout a worm
He's the funkiest
Worm in the world
Okay, sing it, fellas

There's a worm in the ground
Yes, there is
(That's right)
He's six feet down
(Six feet down)

He only comes around
When he wants to get down
But when he comes
Out of his hole
He sounds something like this

Oh, that's funky
That's funky

Like nine cans
Of shaving powder
That's funky
Come on with again
Fellas, come on with it

In a boring land
Yeah, yeah (sing it)
He plays in a band
(Plays in a band)
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add

Yeah, when he grabs his
Guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to
Get up and dance

Ah, get it, baby

I'm his manager, yeah
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all too
He can't spend it

Don't stop now, honey
Get down

That's it, that's it
Don't, don't, don't
Fight the feeling
Don't fight it

Okay, that's enough
Get out of here
There ain't no people
Listening to this
This is really funky
Get out of here

Going back in his hole
Just the same way he came out

Do we get paid for this (yes)
I want to know (yes, of course)
We do, okay, okay (yes) alright
(You're welcome)
