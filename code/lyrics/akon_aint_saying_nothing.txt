Song:

The streets is cryin' man
I know y'all miss your boy
Konvict music he he

The streets is cryin' man
I know y'all miss your boy
Konvict music he he

The streets is cryin' man
I know y'all miss your boy
Konvict music he he
Yeah, real n****s recognize real

Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cuz in the hood n***a jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

I'm gangsta, I never left, I just had to chill
Me and 50 runs, you n****s that we still kill
Stacks in the grass tryna police mix
Say I made 'em to large, I'm obese n***a
8 hundred million then I cashed out
You ain't got it but now within' your hair style
I read the blueprint and then I ran with it
Get with the pooh, he went and milked his grand with it yea

Real n****s recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cuz in the hood n***a jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

In position of power so now they hear me
May not have did it but I know these n****s fear me
Every year I grind harder than the last one
Life's short, you never know when it's your last one
Black as f**k my girlie, I'mma call us the steelers
Keep a hundred when n****s in hide between us
You wanna hustle just know I supply the dealer
All you live in a jungle and you ain't a gorilla yea

Real n****s recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cuz in the hood we go shoppin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Chorus:]

(Streets are dyin')
Real n****s recognize real
Know you heard it before I seen the blunts peel
Cuz in the hood n***a jumpin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin' ah
Ain't sayin' nothin'
And when they askin' questions then you ain't sayin' nothin'
