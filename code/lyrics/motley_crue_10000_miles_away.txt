Song:

I been drinkin lately girl
You know I'm sick in love
Don't know when I'll be home
Then I see the faces when I'm
Standin on the stage
It gets me thru the nights
And when I'm feelin cold...all I have
To do is call
To warn my heart 10,000 miles away
I been feelin low and I really miss
My son
Hey boy I'm callin you
When I think about our lives it gets
Me thru the nights
Adn warm my heart 10,000 miles away
You knew this was a hard life
When you met me
Sometimes I can't feel if it's night or day
You now I couldn't trade this baby
If I had to
Goddamn, it's hard being so in love
It's true
Maybe I'm a gypsy baby livin on stage
Something's I guess will never
Never change
Girl I know you love me even with
This path I choose
I hear you call mu name
Anytime at all, anytime at all
I'll warm your heart
10,000 miles away
