A teenager's romance is fickled or true
A teenager's romance is red hot or blue
You're either in misery or high on a crest
A teenager's romance is like all the rest

They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves, dear
What's black and what's white

Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on

They tell us we're different
We haven't the right
To decide for ourselves, dear
What's black and what's white

Keep saying you love me
And they'll look upon
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on
A teenager's romance
That goes on and on
