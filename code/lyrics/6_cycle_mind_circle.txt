Song:

Me, I'm a part of your circle of friends
And we notice you don't come around
Me, I think it all depends
On you touching ground with us

(Chorus:)
(But) I quit, I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems
And I quit, I give up
Nothing's good enough for anybody else
It seems

Everything is temporary anyway
When the streets are wet
The color slip into the sky
But I don't know why that means you and I are
That means you and

(Repeat Chorus)

And being alone
Is the best way to be
When I'm by myself it's
The best way to be
When I'm all alone it's
The best way to be
When I'm by myself
Nobody else can say

Me, I'm a part of your circle of friends
And we notice you don't come around

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
