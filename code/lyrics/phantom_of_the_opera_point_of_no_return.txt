Song:

Past the point of no return, no backward glances
The games we've played, till now are at an end
Past all thought of if or when, no use resisting
Abandon thought and let the dream descend

What raging fire shall flood the soul?
What rich desire unlocks it's door?
What sweet seduction lies before us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
What warm unspoken secrets will we learn?
Beyond the point of no return

You have brought me
Through that moment where words run dry
Through that moment where speech disappears
Into silence, silence

I have come here, hardly knowing the reason why
In my mind I've already imagined
Our bodies entwining defenseless and silent
And now I am here with you
No second thoughts, I've decided, decided

Past the point of no return, no going back now
Our passion play has now at last begun
Past all thought of right or wrong, one final question
How long should we two wait, before we're one?

When will the blood begin to race

The sleeping bud burst into bloom?
When will the flames at last consume us?

Past the point of no return, the final threshold
The bridge is crossed, so stand and watch it burn
We've passed the point of no return

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Lead me, save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you here beside you

Anywhere you go let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of

What is it? What has happened?
Ubaldo! Oh my God! My God! 
We're ruined Andre, ruined! 
Monsieur le Vicomte! 
Come with me! 
Oh my darling, my darling! 
Who has done this to you?
You! Why did you let this happen?

Monsieur le Vicomte
I know where they are
But can I trust you?
You must, but remember
Your hand at the level of your eyes! 
But why, why?
The Punjab lasso, Monsieur
First Buquet, now Piangi

Like this, Monsieur I'll come with you
No, Meg! No, you stay here! 
Come with me, Monsieur
Hurry, or we shall be too late!
