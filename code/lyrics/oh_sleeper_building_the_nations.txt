Song:

I've found the pit to find yourself surrounded.
To the husbands and daughters, brides and sons,
You put a tyrannic terror up on his throne.
He's collecting blood like diamonds from all.
Behind this door we face a war... Its claiming more.
Step back and take a look around you because we will...
Destroy! Rebuild! Plant the seeds to reclaim victory!
On this day we will...
Destroy! Rebuild! Plant the seeds to reclaim victory!
Though struggle we'll press on.
Mark my words, you can't find comfort in the arms of constrictors.
Lift back the scabs of content and prepare for change.
The doors swing wide, and we're drawn inside.
The gold stained bones give off the only light.
Oh, I found your prints on a fleshy pulse.
You made the waves to meet my foot
And all the siren songs that ring on and on and on.
I watched your vipers bring down the bishop and bait the chains to leave me hit.
Well I've brought all the archers, we lit all the pyres, and we've come to...
Destroy! Rebuild! Plant the seeds to reclaim victory!
On this day we will...
Destroy! Rebuild! Plant the seeds to reclaim victory!
Through struggle we press on...
We are the army of the far from perfect.
This is the call to tear down and rebuild this world
