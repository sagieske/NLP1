Song:

A.D.D. - Disorder!
A.D.D. - Bored to death!
I can't sit still for a minute

Most impatient kid on the planet
Got A.D.D. and I ain't kiddin'
Gunna overdose on my Ritalin

High Schools fucking unreal
Six hours of sitting still
Always having a teacher telling you what to do
(Insert your high school's name here) FUCK YOU!

Sitting out in the rain
Where the fuck is the train?
Can't do anything for to long
Now I'm sick of this song
