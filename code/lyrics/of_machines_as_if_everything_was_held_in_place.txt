Song:

This is where the pages start to turn
I have put myself here
This is where I stand in awe
I stand apart
I am the one who's lost
I am the one who's lost
As if everything was held in it's place
Held in it's place

(Whoa)
If I cast this stone,
Will other follow?
If I cast this stone,
Will others...

How could this be happening to me
In the lack of direction
In the lack of direction
Speak up,
Your words start to decay
Speak up,
Stand back,
And listen to my words
This is not where we should part
With all this space between
There should be no room for mistakes

I won't play this again
I won't be apart of this anymore...

(Whoa)
If I cast this stone,
Will other follow?
If I cast this stone,
Will others...

With the lack of direction
Speak up
Speak out
