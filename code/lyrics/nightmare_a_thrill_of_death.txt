Song:

I control a land of silence
Dreaming of lifetime
Do you realize, there is no final warning
When I see you inside my lens
Hanging around on through the ruins
I've never been so close to open fire
I've been waiting for another victim
'Cause I am the avenger

Is this war unavailling?
The slaughter I spread will never ends

Search for a reason in this world of sin! 
Give me a reason, is this the world I dream?

I never justify my actions
I ignore my crimes
I terrorize the panic stricken minds

On the fireline of my long range gun
I never ask useless questions
Like a sniper I shoot my targets out
I'm washing out my disillusion
I have no place for any doubt

Is this war unavailling?
The slaughter I spread will never ends

Search for a reason in this world of sin! 
Give me a reason, is this the world I dream?
Search for a reason in this world of sin! 
Give me a reason, is this the world I dream?... 
Give me a reason...
