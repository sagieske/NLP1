Song:

Out on the street
The summer heat
Boys playing games
Changing their names
Pulling tricks
Getting their kicks
All the way down
Let it ride

Meetin the stars
In funky bars
Shiny new cars
And back door lies 
Trying to hike
Or any other type of ride
All the way down
Let it ride

Trying everythank now
Gotta check it out
Trying everythang now
Gotta check it out
Hey girl! 
You want a blow?
Why not?
I got nowhere to go.

Benny the Albino
Says don't be a whino
Try these here flakes
They got what it takes
To make you a star

All the way down
And change who you are
Let it ride

Tell me were you satisfied?
Did you mix it?
Did you like it?
Oooh! Tell me was it good to you.
I wanna know did you make enough money?
Did you make enough money to do down in style?
Or did you find yourself just dying, dying, dying
After a while?

Got to get off! 
Got to get off! 
I got to go, got to, got to, got to get off! 
Please help me, help me! 
To git off now, now! 
Before I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees
And lose my key to freedom.
And I go, All the way down, All the way down.
