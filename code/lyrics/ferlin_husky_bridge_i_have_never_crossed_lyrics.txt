Song:

All my life I've traveled o'er the country I've even flown and sailed across the sea
Name of famous bridge ah I betcha that I've crossed
And all the women that I've loved have all crossed me
That's the one bridge that I have never crossed everything I ever loved I always lost
For the true love I'd gladly pay the cost
But that's the one bridge I have never crossed
[ dobro ]
I've made a lot of money in my lifetime
I've got a million friends ah I know some envy me
But nobody know how bad I need affection
And how I long to find the love that won't cross me
That's the one bridge...
[ dobro ]
That's the one bridge...
