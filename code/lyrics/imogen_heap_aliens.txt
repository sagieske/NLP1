Song:

It was late a night, a very star one
And the sky was so very blue
Something caught my eye
Shot across the sky, as a gleaming white contraption
Clearly very new

These funny looking creatures
Lulling in my backyard
Who were here from out of a hatch
They waved to me
Form down below
With their funny heads
Holding their hats

So come on stay, stay with me
Please don't go away
Come on and talk to me, please feel free
Do you speak english?
'Cause i want to talk to you
Where do you come from?

I bet it's wonderful where you live
You gotta space ship
I bet there's funny machines everywhere
I bet you got flying cars
But ours can only go fast
We can't do the thing that you can do
It's just not fair
I wonder, do you have a time machine
That takes you anywhere you wanna be, and everything you wanna see

People might think i'm mindless
Unless i've got some kind of proof
Of you being here with me

So come on stay, stay with me
Please don't go away
Come on and talk to me, please feel free
Do you speak english?
'Cause i want to talk to you
Where do you come from?

Did it take you long form where you came from
And they wouldn't like me, as you could see
Have a head like a cone
With the color like a stone
I was on my own
Will anyone one believe me

I'm gonna tell you something now
You gotta keep it to yourself
It's a secret only you and i know
Remember that night i told you of ?? In my garden
One of them flew up to say hello
He took my by his hand
Up on my lips
And he freed his words on to me
He said you are now one of a kind in our minds
All of our powers to me

So come on stay, stay with me
Please don't go away
Come on and talk to me, please feel free
Do you speak english?
'Cause i want to talk to you
Where do you come from?
