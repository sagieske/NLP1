Song:

BROKEN VOW by: Lara Fabian
Tell me her name, I want to know
The way she looks and where you go
I need to see her face I need to understand
Why you and I came to an end
Tell me again, I want to hear
Who broke my faith in all these years
Who lays with you at night?
When I'm here all alone
Remembering when I was your own
CHORUS
I'll let you go, I'll let you fly
Why do I keep on asking why?
I'll let you go, I'll let you fly
Now that I found a way to keep somehow
More than a broken vow
Tell me the words I never said
Show me the tears you never shed
Give me the touch, the one you promise to be mine
Or has it vanished for all time
(Repeat Chorus)
I close my eyes and dream if you and I
And then I realize, there's more
To life than only bitterness lies
I close my eyes;
I give away my soul
To hold you once again
And never let this promise end
(Repeat Chorus)
