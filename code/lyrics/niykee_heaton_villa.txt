Song:

I know a place where no one flows
Grims in, sits back and sip a little
Don't know, I can't wait, the time goes
Stay high, lights low
You'd have to see to believe me
Grissed off, float like the Riviera
Go high, we're living easy
Follow my lead
Don't need to talk about it,
'Cause if you are about it
And if you really wanna roll, roll
Show me what you worth
We can make it work,
Come with me let's go!

Step in, sucking and feeling
One taste and you're fainting
You don't have to leave, yeah
Back trees, sound of the palm leaves
Yeah baby I promise that

What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa

Woke up we both end in the bath tub
No drink, clink clink and in the middle
Someone give me a back rub
A little to the left, left, that's good
Who the f**k brought a python
That's chill, just don't come any closer
You've been smoking to my song, all day, and now you're gone

Don't need to talk about it,
'Cause if you are about it
And if you really wanna roll, roll
Show me what you worth
We can make it work
Come with me let's go!

Step in, sucking and feeling
One taste and you're fainting
You don't have to leave, yeah
Back trees, sound of the palm leaves
Yeah baby I promise that

What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa

Stay the night, you're never leaving once you stepped inside, yeah
Stay the night, I got that something that will change your life, yeah
At the motherfucking villa!
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa
With the villa
What happens here it stays with the villa
