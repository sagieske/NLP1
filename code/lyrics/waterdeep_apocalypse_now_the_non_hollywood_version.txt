Song:

I saw a movie on tv late last night
New york city was taken by a plague
But the medical authorities arrested it early
How they did it was a little bit vague though
Just a little bit too vague for me

And then my mind started turning
And my hands began to sweat
Because I thought of how itd come out
These people wouldve died faster than suicide
And the plauge with consume us no doubt
Woah without a doubt

And then I got to thinkin greatly
Of the things I've noticed lately
How it all looks like its comin to an end
And though this plague was on the screen
Theres real things we have seen
Looks like a slow trains comin round
Like a slow trains comin round
Comin round the bend

Chorus
And you said
We'd hear of wars and rumors of wars
But we shouldnt be afraid
Earthquake and faminie, don't cry my friend
Although the ax in the root of the tree has been laid
For the one who endures to the end shall be saved

You know I almost want to cry
When I think about the lie that
Were doomed and theres no way out
But the dice is cast when we step out of the womb
Unless theres something that you can do nothing about
But it all doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter anyway

We think its already decided
That fates to be abided
And deaths in the cards for us all
It doesn't matter how you act
And once you knwo how to tack
Someones gonna make you fall
No matter, no matter who you are

Oh death
Wheres its sting?
There was some of us you said would never taste this thing
Oh death
Wheres its sting?
There was some of us you said would never taste this thing

Chorus
You said we'd hear of wars and rumors of wars
But we shouldnt be afraid
Earthquake and faminie
Don't cry my friend
Although the ax in the root of the tree has been laid
For the one who endures to the end shall be saved

Oh death
Wheres its sting?
There was some of us you said would never taste this thing
Oh death
Wheres its sting?
There was some of us you said would never taste this thing

Chorus
You said we'd hear of wars and rumors of wars
But we shouldnt be afraid
Earthquake and faminie
Don't cry my friend
Although the ax in the root of the tree has been laid
For the one who endures to the end
I said the one who endures to the end
Well now, the one who endures to the end shall be saved
