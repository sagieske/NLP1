Song:

When I die don't cry for me
In my father's arms I'll be

The wounds this world left on my soul
Will all be healed and I'll be whole

Sun and moon will be replaced
With the light of jesus face

And I will not be ashamed
For my saviour knows my name

It don't matter where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free

It don't matter where I lay
All my tears be washed away

Gold and silver blind the eye
Temporary riches light

Come and eat from Heavens store
Come and drink, and thirst no more

So weep not for me my friend
When my time below does end

For my life belongs to Him
Who will raise the dead again

It don't matter, where you bury me
I'll be home and I'll be free

It don't matter, where I lay
All my tears be washed away

It don't matter, they're washed away
It don't matter, they're washed away
It don't matter, they're washed away

Yeah, yeah, yeah
It don't matter where you bury me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They're washed away
They're washed away
