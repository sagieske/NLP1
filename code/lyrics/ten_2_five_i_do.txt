Song:

On this right night I wanna swear
I'll always be there by your side
This I promise you babe
That I'll always treat you right

Cuz so many men I know
You're the one that I love so true
Every little thing you did to me
Nobody else can do

I do I do I do I do I do... Love you
I do I do I do I do I do... Need you
I do I do I do I do I do... Think about you
There's nothing more that I want, from You...

Don't keep the problem inside
Just tell me and we'll try to fix it up
We're gonna go thru this together
I'll be there for you anytime you want

Cuz so many girl I know
You're the one that I love so true
Every little thing you did to me
Nobody else can do

I do I do I do I do I do... Love you
I do I do I do I do I do... Need you
I do I do I do I do I do... Think about you
There's nothing more that I want, from You...

Just believe what I say
It's not a game I'm trying to play
Never found this way before
Now I love you more and more

Coz I do I do I do I do I do... Love you
I do I do I do I do I do... Need you
I do I do I do I do I do... Think about you
There's nothing more that I want, from You...
