Song:

Opening:
You got to open your eyes in the morning,
Nine o'clock comin' without any warnin'
And you gotta get ready to go.

You say you went out late last evenin'
Did a lot of drinkin', come home stinkin',
And you went and fell asleep on the floor.
And then your lady comes and finds you a sleepin'
Starts into weepin' 'bout the hours you been keepin'
And you better get your ass out the door.

Ain't no crime,
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind,
It ain't no crime,
Well, ev'rybody gets that way sometime.
It ain't no crime.
Oh.

Opening

Well now you tell me you love somebody
And you'll love 'em forever, you may love 'em forever,
But you won't like 'em all of the time.
Well now you tell me you need somebody
For the rest of your life you might have somebody,
But you won't want 'em ev'ry day.

Ain't no crime,
Well it's just human nature, happens all the time,
It ain't no crime,
Well ?????
It ain't no crime.
Oh.

Ain't no crime,
Yeah, it's good to get it on to get a load off your mind,
It ain't no crime,
Well it's just human nature, happens all the time,
It ain't no crime.
Oh.

Opening

And just as surely as the wind keeps blowin',
The grass keeps growin', you gotta keep goin',
And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Oooh, la la la la.
