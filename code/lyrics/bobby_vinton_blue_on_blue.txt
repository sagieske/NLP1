Song:

Chorus):
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
Blue on blue now that we are through
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
And I find I can't get over losing you
I walk along the street we used to walk
Two by two, lovers pass
And as they're passing by, I could die
'cause you're not here with me
Now the trees are bare
There's sadness in the air
And I'm as blue as I can be
[Chorus:]
Night after lonely night, we meet in dreams
As I run to your side
You wait with open arms, open arms
That now are closed to me
Through a veil of tears
Your vision disappears
And I'm as blue as I can be
(repeat chorus and fade
