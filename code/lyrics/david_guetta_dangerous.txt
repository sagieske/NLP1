Song:

You take me down
Spin me around
You got me running all the lights
Don't make a sound
Talk to me now
Let me inside your mind
Don't know what you're thinking, sugar
But I just got that feeling sugar
And I can hear sirens burning bad
Lights turnings
I can't turn now

So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But f*ck another night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
But baby this is getting serious Oh
Detain the dangerous Oh

Show me your soul
I gotta know
Bet that you're beautiful inside
Toes are not grass
Coming fast
Come take the wheel and drive

I don't know what you're thinking, sugar
But I just got that feeling sugar
And I can hear sirens burning bad
Lights turnings
I can't turn now

So hold on tight
I don't know where the lights are taking us
But f*ck another night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
But baby this is getting serious Oh
Detain the dangerous Oh
Detain the dangerous

It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
Come on baby
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again
It's dangerous, so dangerous
I wanna do it again

I don't know where the lights are taking us
But f*ck another night is dangerous
And nothing's holding back the two of us
But baby this is getting serious Oh
Detain the dangerous Oh
Detain the dangerous
