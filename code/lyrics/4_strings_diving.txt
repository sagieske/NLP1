Song:

Tell me a secret
I'll tell you mine
Tell me about desires
You hide inside
There is so much that we
Should have done
I was insecure, but
Now I'm strong
Diving
Whatever it may take
I keep on trying
Diving into you
Diving
Knowing it was you
I keep on trying
Diving into you
Diving into you
I'm diving
Into the blue
We are rising
Celebrate the light
It was you who showed me
How to fly
Diving
Whatever it may take
I keep on trying
Diving into you
Diving
Knowing it was you
I keep on trying
Diving into you
