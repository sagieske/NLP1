Song:

Tonight this c*** will pay.
My d**k will beat her face.
Her life and her c*** are mine.
This s*** shall now see.

All night on this b***h I release my piece.
Yes. Yes. I am the man.
And I will kill when I can.
You can try to run.
But your done.
Run.
Gun to your head.
One more sound and your dead.
Kick in your teeth.
With my c*** piece.

Sweet labial meat.
Her inside out twat.
Tastes great to eat.
Dripping and slipping and oozing and flowing with spit.
This vile slit.
Will ghost ride my prick.

Blood pours from her tender throat.
I left her bound to a tree.
Nude. Mangled. Butchered and Blasted.
Now these s****s know not to f**k with me
