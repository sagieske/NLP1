I crossed on the river
There'll be no returning
I crossed all the bridges
I watched them all burning
And now I'm a stranger
To a strange land I'm driven
Where all is forgotten
And nothing's forgiven

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

I think of him now
On the road I am taking
And wonder how long
His heart will be breaking
But he'll never hear when
The teardrops are falling
Or the sound of my voice
Or the name I am calling

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him

So weep for the sons
And the dear darling daughters
For the passing of time
And the parting of waters
For all who have passed through
This world long before me
To a far distant shore line
Where no one waits for me

But I cried a river
A river for him
That's deeper and wider
Than I'll ever swim
The heart it will harden
The sorrow will dim
But I cried a river
A river for him
