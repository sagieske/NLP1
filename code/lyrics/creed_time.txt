Song:

I can't explain, can't quite put my finger on
The difference that makes us so different
We've said everything, our words only betrayed us
Nothing is left, nothing was left unsaid

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck, the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine

You cover yourself, you cover your skin
You cover yourself, like you cover your sin
Please untie my hands
I'm a sinner, I'm a man
I ask for one minute
To make you understand

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck, the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine

Will you be there
To catch me when I stumble when I fall
When I fall
It's so very clear
You left me when I had no one at all
No one at all

Who will be there
To catch me, to catch me when I stumble
When I fall, when I fall
It's so very clear, you left me
Left me with no one at all
No one at all

This time I have nothing left to lose
I'm stuck, the second hand won't move
It's about time that I speak my mind
It's about time, about time I find
Pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Hey time you're no friend of mine
Hey time you're no friend of mine

The pieces of me I have lost
Without any choice I move on
Time, time you're no friend of mine
