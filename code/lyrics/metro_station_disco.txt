Song:

I wonder if you're going down
Well, we all know
You get lost and then get found
And then I wonder so

I can't take this
No, I don't like it
I don't know where you are

I wonder if that's what you said
I wonder in my sleep
I can't believe that's what you heard
Can you not feel?

I can't take this
No, I don't like it
I don't know where you are

You know, she's dancing, at the disco
And, whoa-oh
She's dying, on the dance floor

I know you're sleeping all alone
You feel suicidal
I know you're dying to get out
But it's in you deep inside

I can't take this
No, I don't like it
I don't know where you are

Do you feel it in your veins?
The poison rushing through?
But can't you see it in your heart?
That I'm still there for you

I can't take this
No, I don't like it
I don't know where you are

You know, she's dancing, at the disco
And whoa-oh
She's dying, on the dance floor

(Say my name)
You don't even know it
(I am done)
Well, you sure aren't showing it
(Hold my hand)
You know she's on the dance floor
(I know she's dying)
But still she craves more!

(Say my name)
You don't even know it
(I am done)
Well, you sure aren't showing it
(Hold my hand)
You know she's on the dance floor
(I know she's dying)
But still she craves more!

You know, she's dancing, at the disco
And, whoa-oh
She's dying, on the dance floor
Yeah, yeah, she's dancing, at the disco
And, whoa-oh
She's dying, on the dance floor
