Song:

Its a bit early in the midnight hour for me,
To go through all the things that I want to be,
I don't believe in everything I see,
Yknow I'm blind so why dyou disagree

Take me away, cos I just don't want to stay,
And the relise you make me say are getting deeper every day,

These are crazy days but they make me shine,
Time keeps rolling by.

All around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
Youre gonna make a better day.

All around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
You know it's gonna be okay.

What you gonna do when the walls come falling down,
You never move you never make a sound,
When you gonna swin with the ridges that you found,
If you're lost at sea well I hope that you drown,

Take me away, cos I just don't want to stay,
And the lies you make me say are getting deeper every day,

These are crazy days but they make me shine,
Time keeps rolling by.

All around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
And all around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
You know it's gonna be okay.

Nanana, nanana, nananana nananaaa,
Nanana, nanana, nananana nananaaa,
Naaaa, naaaa, naaaaa, naaaaa, nanananana,

All around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
Youre gonna make a better day.

And all around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
You know it's gonna be okay.

Cos all around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
Youre gonna make a better day.

And all around the world,
You gotta spread the word,
Tell em what you heard,
You know it's gonna be okay.
