[Intro: Various Artists]

(f**k ya circle) Yeah, same punch line
(f**k ya circle) Yeah, Same punch line

[Hook: xv]
Laugh tracks, applause and handclaps
As we hear the same punch lines in all these damn raps
Been soft, lip balm, sitcom acts
Square, who me? Never been called that
Squarian ether don’t play this close to the heater
Put some water in the tray and just place inside the freezer
Take it out when you’ve made that follower a leader
Then throw ice cubes down for the nicest emcee up

[Verse 1: xv]
Unbelievable L7 believer
Since I was next to seven that night that I held the receiver
I’m in la taking a breather when the twins stopped breathing
Then I made square in the circle to get over the grieving
Or when my grandma passed, and I just kept dreaming
That she was like, right there and I just kept reaching
But couldn’t reach it, that’s the reason Imma’ shine til she sees it
Or til I make it to heaven, and ask “grandma you see it?” believe it

[Hook: xv]
Laugh tracks, applause and handclaps
As we hear the same punch lines in all these damn raps
Been soft, lip balm, sitcom acts
Square, who me? Never been called that
Squarian ether don’t play this close to the heater
Put some water in the tray and just place inside the freezer
Take it out when you’ve made that follower a leader
Then throw ice cubes down for the nicest emcee up

[Verse 2: xv]
Biggie’s demon, I took a weekend to let it sink in
Refraining from reaching, the mind state Chris Lighty was thinkin’
Eating church’s while my label’s preaching
They can’t reach me on the jack so instead they jack reaching
Bad reason
Have meetings bout’ tracks with wack treatments
And acts that’s half decent and bars that’s half eaten
Let’s fact check these Rap Genius meanings when it lacks genius
N****s suck, like Sookie's last season. (Laughter)

[Hook: xv]
Laugh tracks, applause and handclaps
As we hear the same punch lines in all these damn raps

Square, who me? Never been called that
Squarian ether don’t play this close to the heater
Put some water in the tray and just place inside the freezer
Take it out when you’ve made that follower a leader
Then throw ice cubes down for the nicest emcee up

[Verse 3: xv]
You thought a square wasn’t cool?
Threw em’ two ice cubes, Jay said “New Rules”
Might bring back jerry curl juice with this fro like Fudge
Higher learning like the view of a dead poet standing on his chair inside a school
Taking shots off the top, like Remy on the roof
Screaming f**k n****s
I hope you got Aflac, Duck n***a, cuz’ here comes the attack
Smooth as orange Julius Caesar under my snapback
Got strap for n****s that be thirsty for an @ back
That’s that, the roots to the square that I am
Used to rap like 50 cent, now I rap 100’s in bands
The real square root of a key, is 32 grams
But when did I expect these dudes to tell the truth to their fans huh?
Must have forgot where I am
The kid with the green backpack is back to the plan
So when I hear these punch lines about squares from these rap n****s
They’re the first to remind me, don’t rap like the last n***a
I heard this game is like handling dope
So the 10 crack commandments is the s**t that I quote
I learned you can’t fix the game if you end up broke
Ask Nas, he made Ether, now that camel’s the goat
So if you take their breath away, keep your hands on their throat
Squarian ether, that’s a more fatal of dose
