Song:

Time you died for you religion
Hypnotized by his infliction
Go to him, he is your saviour
Leave this place, do us a favor
Believe the lie of a god you'll never know
Prepare to die when you least expect to go
A desperate mind will ignore reality
The word of christ has you lost in fantasy
Believe the lie to reside with him in death
Conserve to buy into what he's promising
Don't be so blind not to mind hypocrisy
You just might find what you want can never be
Take your life, be a true christian
For the lies of it's existence
Sacrifice rendered unable
Book of god, it is a fable
Believe the lie to return from which we came
The serpent's light has you mesmerized again
When faiht decides suicide at heaven's whim
Believe the lie, you are saved from all your sins
When is life worth a religion
Ease your mind, make the incision
Prey to him, incoming stranger
Son of god dead in th manger
