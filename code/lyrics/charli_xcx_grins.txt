Song:

Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
I don’t suppose you’d shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
I don’t suppose you’d shoot me dead again
I’m not comin’ out
I won’t scream or shout
‘Cause I feel like I’m in heaven dancing with an angel
Cause burned out
Lost my breath now
‘Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds
Hope we’re on the same wavelength
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up and come and save me
I can’t quite hear what you’re saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, love is quaking
That’s my heart that you were breaking
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
I don’t suppose you’d shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I’m lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
I don’t suppose you’d shoot me dead again
I’m not comin’ out
I won’t scream or shout
‘Cause I feel like I’m in heaven dancing with an angel
Cause burned out
Lost my breath now
‘Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds
Hope we’re on the same wavelength
Hope you don’t think that I’m crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up and come and save me
I can’t quite hear what you’re saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, love is quaking
That’s my heart that you were breaking
