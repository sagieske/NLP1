Song:

Well the time has passed now it seems
When I sleep I never dream, I, I wonder why
I've got the chance, had confidence
When I was a young man, now I, I didn't cry
Those sunny days never pass you by
California and the good, good life, I loved it so
But like you too I get the blues
And now I say now, now, now
Me, me and the rain, yeah we know
Bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
I love the rain, I, I love now, I love the rain
The cloudy skies can bring you back
Your mind can wander off the track, you head for home
The streets are empty everywhere
That I not, and no one cares, now you're all alone
They might take this, they might take that
Still it doesn't change the fact that you get by
Self-pity is the thing that I avoid now
'Cause you see it makes, makes everybody, everybody cry
Now I say bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
I need the rain, I, I love now, I love the rain
Those sunny skies all look the same
Man I'm looking for a change, I, I want some rain now
Ooh, bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
Well now rain can give you some sort of peace of mind
A passing storm always takes it's time
Gives the world peace and solitude now
It's something that we all look forward to
Bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
I love the rain, I, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need the rain now
Well them summer days about to look the same
Man I'm looking for a change, how about some rain, Diane?
Ooh, bring on the rain, bring on the rain now, bring on the rain
Bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
How about the change? I need, I need, I need, I love, I love the rain
Bring on the rain, bring on the rain, bring on the rain
Bring on the rain, I need, I need, I need, I love, I love the rain
"You're special sweet, just it makes you good." Ooh, ooh...
