[Jacob Banks]

I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown
Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round
Now they hear me sing, they want to come round round
I been waiting long for the sun to shine down
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
Mmmhmm

[Wretch 32]

Imagine that
Never gave a sh*t, now I’m giving back
Used to run around the flats saying “brap”
Now I got the whole festival saying that
Thinking ’bout the youths that have tags
Now look at me paying vat
I remember coming home to my bags
The door wasn’t on the latch
But mum, I’ll always love you for that
Only real women make a man
That’s why I wanna give you more than a hand
That’s why I wanna give you more than my bank
I just wanna see you fly, wanna bring back my nan
Wanna put you in the sky, give you land when you land
Still ain’t met your new man
He better do you right ‘fore I turn this to a wrap
‘Cause I’m living on kick

[Jacob Banks]

I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown
Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round
Now they hear me sing, they want to come round round
I been waiting long for the sun to shine down
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
Mmmhmm

[Wretch 32]

If you live where I live
You’ll understand why I do it big
Late night daydreaming ’bout my kids
‘Til the day I die, they’re the reason that I live
I just had to do it right, done the legit thing
I ain’t just a role model in the business
Tell my baby mother don’t cry for me
I’ll just have to love you from a distance
And I’m still the man, just a little more clearer
I traded grams, switched them for letters
Just like Instagram makes things look better
When I hit the ground, I’ll live forever
Live forever, I’m alright with that
Rolex on my wrist, good times are back
Can’t get evicted, I can buy my flat
Life’s so relaxed

[Jacob Banks]

I was a lonely man, you can find me downtown
Playing blues songs for anybody that comes round
Now they hear me sing, they want to come round round
I been waiting long for the sun to shine down
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
I’m doing ok
Mmmhmm
