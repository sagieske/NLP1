Song:

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful)
(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful)
God has not promised me sunshine
That's not the way it's going to be
But a little rain (A little rain)
Mixed with God's sunshine
A little pain (A little pain)
Makes me appreciate thegood times

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Grateful
(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Grateful
God desires to feel your longing
Every pain that you feel
He feels them just like you (Just like you)
But he can't afford to let you feel only good (Only good)
Then you can appreciate the good times

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Grateful
(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Be Grateful
Because there's someone else who's worse off than you
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Because there's someone else who'd love to be in your shoes
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)
Oh yeah!
My God said he'd never, never foresake you!
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)oh yeah!
God said he would, he would never, never forsake you!
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)oh yeah!
Be Grateful Hallelujah!
Oh! Be Grateful
The Lord is the light!

Be Grateful (Be Grateful)Yeah, Yeah
Be Grateful
For everything you got!
Be Grateful (Be Grateful)Yeah, Yeah
Beeeee Grateful(be Grateful)
Beeeee Grateful (Be Grateful)

For it will be alright!
