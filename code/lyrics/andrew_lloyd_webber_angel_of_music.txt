Song:

Phantom
Bravi, bravi, bravissimi!

Meg
Where in the world
Have you been hiding?
Really - you were perfect
I only wish
I knew your secret
Who is this new
Tutor?

Christine
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing I can sense him
And I know he's here

Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside, hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius

Meg
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you're talking in riddles
And it's not like you

Christine
Angel of music, guide and guardian
Grant to me your glory

Meg
Who is this angel?
This...

Both
Angel of music, hide no longer
Secret and strange angel

Christine
He's with me even now

Meg
Your hands are cold

Christine
All around me

Meg
Your face, christine, it's white

Christine
It frightens me

Meg
Don't be frightened
