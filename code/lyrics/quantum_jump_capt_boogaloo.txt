Song:

Hayla mwoi lola
Hayna hayla
Lohanna hola
Go hanna la
"Hold on tight, hold on tight,
Don't let go.
We'll make it," he said
And then we baled out.
"Look out."
Supercool supersly superstitious
Crissa-crossa
We landed in a swamp beside the sea
It was a nice place to land
The South China Sea.
Capt. Boogaloo I've got a bone to pick
With you.
"Don't look now, don't look now,"
The Captain said.
"Take it easy
We're surrounded - hunted."
Supercool supersly superstitious
A native tribe emerging from the trees
They took us all away and did as they pleased
Captain Boogaloo I've got a bone to
Pick with you
Hayla mwoi lola
Hayna hayla
Lohanna hola
Go hanna la
Day and night, day and night,
Night and day
They never let up
And so I cut out - shut out.
Supercool supersly superstitious
It seemed to me one chance to be free
I blew out my brains
And here's the remains
Captain Boogaloo I've got a bone to
Pick with you
(Still travellin')
