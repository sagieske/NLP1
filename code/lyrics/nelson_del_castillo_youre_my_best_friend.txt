Song:

Many people say true friends
are hard to find
But I know I'm not that kind
They come and go and
sometimes leave us behind
Like a wind that passes by

Chorus
(Cause)When you need a friend
That you can depend
You can count on me because
you're my best friend
When you're feeling down
And your heart is hurt
You can call on me and
i'll be there for you friend

Good things may come and then
bad things may go
Like a birth a long time ago
You're like the ship that's sailing
across the sea
To the waves that's so unkind

(Repeat Chorus)
(Repeat Chorus) Hold
(Repeat Chorus)
