Song:

How y'all doin there folks?
My name is Aberdeen Washington
And I'm a proud American
And a terrorist fighter
That's right
Hey gimme another beer b***h!
Now when the day Bin Laden comes to town
Ima drop a duece
Wipe it up with his towel
Mow my lawn
Sit on the couch
Ima watch some football
I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as s**t
God damn right I'm an American
That's right
I'm American

Got a picture of Regan above my fire
Next to the deer I shot with my rifle
Nra hell yeah I support 'em
No pro choice
No abortion
Mexicans, send em back over the boarder
Ride on home to Samoa
Or wherever they come from
Takin' our jobs
Eatin our hamburgers
Takin our jobs
They takin our jobs
I see them in the field
I'm takin their head off
I hate my job
And I hate my boss
But I love my country
And I pray to god
That the cowboys win
F**k yeah Romo!
And the Cowboys win
That's right that's right that's right
C'mon
Everybody
Just clap your hands
If you love our country
If you love our land
That's right
And if you're not clapping your hands
You're a terrorist
And you eat sand
... Sandwiches
The day Bin Laden comes to town
Imma drop a deuce
Wipe my poop with his towel
Mow my lawn
Sit on the couch
And Imma watch some football
And I pray to the lord the Cowboys win
And beat the hell outta them damn redskins
Call up the boys
Get drunk as s**t
God damn right I'm American
I'm Ameri-fuckin-can
And john Mccain and Sarah Palin
I know you lost out there
It was a tough one
But you're still 2 mavericks in my book
Don't worry about it
And listen Palin
I heard you like beer
Me too
I don't have a 6 pack
But I got a beer bong in my pants
What do ya say we go get s**t faced
In a helicopter and kill a moose
America
The chosen
Guns
Explosions
Mcdonalds
Bowling
You don't like it
We exploit you
Pop a pill
Get a boner!
Hell yeah
Tony Romo
Man that guy is so damn cute
I wanna sack his boner
And ride him broke back
All the way to Wyoming
No homo... Sike
Hey I said no homo
F**k terrorists!
I mean like, I don't wanna f**k terrorists
Guys I'm kidding!
I like Romo
I don't "like" Romo
I said f**k terrorists
Not I wanna f**k a terrorist
You would
If you woulda caught bin laden
You wouldn't give him one in the butt?
For America?
If you said "no homo" right after you did it?
It doesn't count if it's terrorists

Doesn't feel the same way I do
