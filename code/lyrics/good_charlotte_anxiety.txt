Song:

Waiting down at the end of the corridor
Don't know this place but I swear I've been here before
The shadows dance with the pictures that hang up on the walls
I hear them laughing as I wander the halls
I can feel my palms sweating now
Pacing back and forth with nothing to say
I can see my mind racing now
The feeling won't go away

It's like a clock ticking slow in the waiting room
It's like a doctor calling but he's got no news
My heart keeps racing, I don't know what to do
You're giving me anxiety

Like a message in a bottle that nobody read
The famous last words that nobody said
Tell me what is wrong tonight
You're giving me anxiety

Anxiety, anxiety

I'm the patient, with no patience
This operation has already failed
It's too late for resuscitation
Can't take away the pressure you make me feel
I can feel my chest heavy now
Weighing down on me, it's harder to breathe
Look in the mirror, got no color now
Another fatality

It's like a clock ticking slow in the waiting room
It's like a doctor calling but he's got no news
My heart keeps racing, I don't know what to do
You're giving me anxiety

Like a message in a bottle that nobody read
The famous last words that nobody said
Tell me what is wrong tonight
You're giving me anxiety

And I'm underwater
And I hate you
What you're doing to me
To me, yeah
Your voice is cold, your eyes look through me
Like they don't know me
They're faking now when there was love
It's empty

A clock ticks slow in the waiting room
The doctor calls but he's got no news
My heart keeps racing, I don't know what to do
You're giving me anxiety

This is the message in a bottle that nobody read
The famous last words that nobody said
Tell me what is wrong tonight
You're giving me anxiety

(I'm underwater)
You're giving me anxiety
(I'm underwater)
You're giving me anxiety
(And I hate you)
You're giving me anxiety
(I'm underwater)
You're giving me anxiety
