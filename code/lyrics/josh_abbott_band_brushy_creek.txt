Song:

Verse 1
I got a guitar; you got a smile.
We can go to Brushy Creek for a while
And have us a good time.
There ain't nothing like the sound
Of the hill country singing in the background.

Verse 2
Well your grandparents own this land,
Built this house with their hands
And lived a good life.
Now they're looking down
Dancing to the hill country background.

Chorus
Oh there's a round rock that lies midstream.
We can go there and share our dreams.
Hike on up to the railroad tracks
And maybe hold hands when we walk back.

Verse 3
A place to think and come back home
When we're tired and feeling alone
In this good life.
Where our love is found
In the hill country singing in the background.

Verse 4
I got a guitar; you got a ring.
Let's go to Brushy Creek this spring
And have us a good time.
There ain't nothing like the sound
Of the hill country singing in the background
