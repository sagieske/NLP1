Song:

I was pulling out my hair the day I cut the deal
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy that my life was just about to change?

One life pretending to be
The cow that got the cream
Oh, everybody said "Marina is a dream"
People like to tell you what you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see,
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe

My problem, it's my problem that I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem on how fast I will succeed.

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?

High achiever, don't you see?
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I'm a control freak driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me

Cuz it's my problem if I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem if I feel I need a high
And it's my problem if I have no friends and feel I want to die

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satified with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line will you be satisfied?

Sad inside, in this life,
Unsatified praying.
Sad inside in this life,
Unsatified waiting.

Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line will you be satisfied?

Are you satisfied? X8
