[50 Cent talking]
Ay Em you know my favorite white boy right...
I.. I owe you for this one

[Chorus:]
I've been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on (yea)
You can stun if you want
And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long (yea)
If you thinking I'ma f*****g
Fall off your so wrong

[50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head
Like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sitting political passengers from 9-11 (yea)
The Lords blessing left me lyrically incline (uh huh)
S**t I ain't even got to try to shine
God's a seamstress who tailorfitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at your thang
Straight out the good book
Look ni***z is shook
50 fear no man warrior
Swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand
Write lines knowin' the source will quote it
When I die they'll read this
And say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my Pops
Should that make me bitter
I caught cases and got out
Does that make me a quitter
In this white mans world
I'm similar to a squirrel
Looking for a s***
Wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone
Will stop ringing again
These industry ni***z ain't friends
They know how to pretend

[Chorus (2x)]
I've been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on (yea)
You can stun if you want
And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long (yea)
If you thinking I'ma f*****g
Fall off your so wrong
(It's 50!!)

[Eminem]

You've been patiently waiting
To make it through all the hate
Debating whether or not
You can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table
They operating to save you
It's like a Angel came to you
Sent from the heavens above
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
S**t basically they just playing sick
They ain't s**t they ain't saying s**t
Spray umh 50 [gun shots]
A to K get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into f*****g mayhem
You staying wit me
Don't let me lose you
I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let lose wit this uzi
And just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message
Am I getting through to you
You know it's coming
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some big and some pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a lil "BIG L" on top
What the f**k do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap s**t
Like it or not it's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
S**t what you know about death threats
Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Some cowards f****d with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
Nuclear showers there's nothing spookier
Your now about to witness the power of fu***n' 50!

[Chorus:]
I've been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on (yea)
You can stun if you want
And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long (yea)
If you thinking I'ma f*****g
Fall off your so wrong
(It's 50!!)
It's the Gun Squad here
And you hear the shots go off
(It's 50, They say It's 50)
You see a n***a laid out
Wit his f*****g top blown off
(It's 50, Man that wasn't 50)
They don't holla my name

[50 Cent]
You shouldn't throw stones
If you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw
You should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face
Have you a** running
Mumbling to the J
Your going against me dogg
You making a mistake
I split yo lip
You looking like them
Michael Jackson Jackets
Wit all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat
You can call me Skipper
The way I turn the money over
You should call me Flipper
Your b***h a regular b***h
Your calling her Wifey
I f****d her feed her fast food
You keepin' her Icey
I'm down to sell records
But not my soul
Snoop said this in '94
"We don't love them ho's"
I got pennies for my thoughts
Now I'm rich
See the 20's spinnin'
Looking mean on the 6
Nigga's wearing flags
Cause the colors match they clothes
The get caught in the wrong hood
And filled up with holes
Motherfucka'

[Chorus (2x)]
I've been patiently waiting
For a track to explode on (yea)
You can stun if you want
And yo ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
It feels like my flows
Been hot for so long (yea)
If you thinking I'ma f*****g
Fall off your so wrong
(It's 50!!)
