Song:

(Deadric Malone, Joe Scott)

When you got a headache
Headache powder soothes the pain
Go right back to sleep
And you feel all right again

When you got a backache
A little rubbin' 'll see you through
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

There ain't nothin' you can do
There ain't nothin' you can do

When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

A man can't break a stone
So he tried another lick
Iceman can't break his ice, Lord
So he tried another pick

An electric lights go out
Candle light will see you through
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

There ain't nothin' you can do
There ain't nothin' you can do
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do
Hey!

(Instrumental & guitar solo)

Man can't break a stone
So he tried another lick
Iceman can't break his ice, Lord
So he tried another pick

'Lectric lights go out
A candle light will see you through
When ya got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

There ain't nothin' you can do, Lord
There ain't nothin' you can do, hey!
When you got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

Ev'ry time I think about it
Ev'ry time I think about it
When ya got a heartache
There ain't nothin' you can do

Ev'ry time I think about it
Ev'ry time I think about it
Ev'ry time I think about it
