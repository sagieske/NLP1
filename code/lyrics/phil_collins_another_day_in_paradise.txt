Song:

She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me? "

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh
Think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh
Think twice
'Cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise

(Think about it)

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh
Think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh
Think twice
It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it

Oh lord!
Is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh-oh whoa lord!
There must be something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh
Think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh
Think twice
It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise (Another day in paradise, ooh)

Just think about it
Hmm-mmm
Think about it

It's just another day
For you and me
In paradise
It's just another day
For you and me
In paradise
(Para, paradise)

(Paradise) It's just another day
For you and me (Ooh-ooh)
(Just think about it) In paradise
(Paradise) It's just another day
For you and me
(Just think about it) In paradise
(Para, paradise)

(Ooh-ooh, in paradise) It's just another day
For you and me
(Hmm-mmm, paradise) In paradise
It's just another day (Paradise)
For you and me (Just another day)
(In paradise) In paradise
(Para, paradise)
