Song:

Scarecrows and devils are the only thing out this late
What that says about me, it's probably true
I've been carrying all these words around
For too long and now it's time to lay them down
I'm here for forgiveness I need it from you

The road was long and it took so much time
But I learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
They made me who I am today
I just got a little lost along the way

I won't blame you if you turn around and slam the door
I understand if you don't want to hear me again
I'm not here to fight, I came to you tonight
To say I'm sorry and to try to make it right
I'm only finding my way back from where I've been, don't know where I've been

The road was long and it took so much time
But I've learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
They made me who I am today
I just got a little lost along the way

The road was long and took so much time
But I learned a lot from my mistakes
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of
Made me who I am today
I just got a little lost
Just been a little lost
I just got a little lost along the way

Scarecrows and devils are the only thing out this late
What that says about me, it's probably true
