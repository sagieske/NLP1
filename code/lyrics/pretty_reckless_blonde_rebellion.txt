Song:

Hurry baby and turn the knob
You don't know you've got me 'til I'm gone
Shut my eyes and count to ten
Do it again, just do it again

Dug my nails in and turned the key
Stupid boy, have you ever really looked at me
Pick my lock and you will see
Come on baby, come on baby

'Cause all I am is a blonde rebellion
Won't hurt you, but I might hurt someone
Break you down 'til you're begging me to
Oh oh oh, one two three shout
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh

You don't know me 'til you've seen me cry
You don't own me, you won't until the day that we die
You don't notice that I try for you
Only you, it's only you

'Cause all I am is a blonde rebellion
Won't hurt you, but I might hurt someone
Break you down 'til you're begging me to
Oh oh oh, one two three shout
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh

Come baby, come baby, come baby, come
Jump baby, jump baby, jump baby, jump
Run baby, run baby, run baby, run
Come baby, come baby, come baby, come

All I am is a blonde rebellion
Won't hurt you, but I might hurt someone
Break you down 'til you're begging me to
Oh oh oh, one two three

All I am is a blonde rebellion
Won't hurt you, but I might hurt someone
Break you down 'til you're begging me to
Oh oh oh, one two three, shout
Woah oh oh oh, woah oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh
