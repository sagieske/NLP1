Song:

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

Love is in the air
I can feel in my heart
Love is everywhere
There's a fire
There's a spark

Everytime I feel like this
There's a new emotion taking place
That goes...

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

Love is in the air
And it's getting me high
Love is everywhere
Can you see in my eyes

Everytime I feel like this
There's a strange emotion taking place
That goes...

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

I wanna climb the mountains
I wanna cross the seas
I wanna do the things
I know what good for me

I wanna reach the heavens
And soar above the clouds
I wanna swim the river
Beneath the midnight sky

I will dance before the sunrise
I will dance before the moonlight
I will dance, I will dance
I will dance until the music dies

I will dance before the sunrise
I will dance before the moonlight
I will dance, I will dance
I will dance until the music dies

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
(Gotta give it up, come on, yeah...)
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
(Gotta give it up, come on)
Yeah...

I will dance before the sunrise
I will dance before the moonlight
I will dance, I will dance
I will dance until...

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
(Na-na-na, na-na...)
