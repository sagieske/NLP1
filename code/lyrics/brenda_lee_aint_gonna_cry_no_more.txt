Song:

Ain't gonna cry no more
Writers jon hall, johanna hall, don schlitz

Baby, I got news that's gonna lay ya low
Since you thought I'd never ever let ya go
I don't know what I was waiting for
But, I ain't gonna cry no more
It not easy not to say goodbye
But all you ever did was make me cry
I don't like it like it was before
But, I ain't gonna cry no more
If you try to treat me bad
Maybe there would be, a little love there
But no, you kept on lying
And I kept on crying
But, I ain't gonna cry no more - oh no
It don't really matter what you say
I ain't listening to you anyway
So go on and sail your boat to shore
Cause I ain't gonna cry no more
Oh no I ain't gonna cry no more
Oh I ain't gonna cry no more
