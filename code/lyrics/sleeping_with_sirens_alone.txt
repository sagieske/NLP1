Song:

Woah, woah

Could you check my pulse for me
To see if I'm alive?
Cuz every time that I am near you
Is the only time I feel alright
If there were any way
I could think to turn back time
I'd stay here with you
Sometimes I sit and wonder
Sometimes I feel like letting go
All I know is no one should have to be alone

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
But I don't want to die alone

I want to be with you, you, you (with you)
I only want to be with you, you, you (with you, with you, with you)

Tell me what's the point of life
Is it material?
Had everything I could ever want and probably more
When I lay in bed at night
All I do is think of you
So when all this is gone what do I have to come home to?
This life goes by so fast
Pretty soon I'll grow old
What would I have but some stories now that I have told
No one to share them with
And when it's all done
What am I left with?
Tell me what's left

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
But I don't want to die alone

(Mgk!)
Leave me? (leave me?)
How the f**k you gonna leave me? (leave me?)
When I'm the one that's on tv
With these girls screaming
Outside with my cd
And I'm begging?
Naw baby, you're the one that can't keep me

Leave me? (leave me?)
Girl how the f**k you gonna leave me? (leave me?)
Uh?! You know I love you, when we fight and we argue
I kiss and I hug you
You push me back, you say that I'm trouble
But every Bonnie got a Clyde with her

Every woman needs somebody that's gonna ride with her
Yeah, and I can't go on staying alive if I'm alone
Pick up the phone and say hello
I'd rather die with her

Now my night's so cold
When your heart is frozen
Mine's exposed you know this
Try to blame the fame for the way I've changed
And you know those claims are bogus
Baby it's not me, it's us
Maybe now all we need is trust
Maybe this Hennessey will solve our problems
Baby pick it up

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
But I don't want to die alone
(Die alone)
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die alone (die alone)
I could fall apart here and now
But I don't want to die alone

Could you check my pulse for me
To see if I'm alive?
