Song:

Hey, how have you been?
It's been a while
It's nice to see you once again
Me, I'm doin' just fine
Livin' my life showin' myself
A real good time

Oh but what am I sayin'?
And who am I foolin'?
So before I let you go
I just think that you
Should know...

I haven't stopped loving you
I haven't stopped wanting you
I haven't stopped hoping that
You feel the same way too
I haven't stopped dreaming
I haven't stopped wishing
I haven't stopped thinking that
You're thinking of me too
I haven't stop loving you

Ohhhhhh... Yeah yeah yeah... Ohhh

I'm happy for you
It's seems you're doin' well
Your seein' someone new
Me, Oh you know me...
Fooling around with every preety girl I see

Oh but what am I sayin'?
And who am I foolin'?
So before I let you go
I just think that you
Should know...

I haven't stopped loving you
I haven't stopped wanting you
I haven't stopped hoping that
You feel the same way too
I haven't stopped dreaming
I haven't stopped wishing
I haven't stopped thinking that
You're thinking of me too
I haven't stop fallin'
Fallin' in love with you...

I haven't stop loving you... I...
I haven't stop loving you... Ohohohh...
I haven't stop loving you... Ohhh...
I still fallin' for you...
