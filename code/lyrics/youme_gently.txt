Song:

No I wouldn't mind going gently into the night
As long as it don't hurt
I won't put up a fight to go beyond the time
When our hands and voice are sold to a world overgrown
It's moving so fast we should slow down
But there's the shadows from the trees
Deader till the windows pain, get right, alive
Waiting once again, lonely from a tree
Down the other kind until I'm done
But I wouldn't mind, no I wouldn't mind

I can see it with my own tilt eyes
That I wouldn't mind
I don't care if I vanish into thin air
As long as there ain't pain
I would leave you that burning pain
To live on the other side
So reckless and free on your own
With no fear of the unknown
But I'm moving too fast I should slow down
But there's the shadow on the trees
Dance on the window pane
Hero of the lie, the way it once again, longing from a tree
Down the other kind until I'm done
But I wouldn't mind, no I wouldn't mind

I can see it with my own tilt eyes
That I wouldn't mind

If time it must be heater
It's embedded in the skies
Stealing all your memories
As leeches passing bye
It's the same old story
Just told on a different day
A ladder on some journey
Down and dark away
But I wouldn't mind
No I wouldn't mind
I can see it with my own tilt eyes
That I wouldn't mind
I wouldn't mind
