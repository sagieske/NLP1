Song:

I need to tell this secret be sure to keep it down
If this gets out I don't know what I'll do
I've held it in through many heartaches and all you did was smile
Can't you see I've fallen in love with you, with you
Apology accepted, erase what's in the past
You need me you don't need them
And in spite of my mistakes, I've learned there's so much I can take
I can't believe what I'm saying
Don't walk away so quickly I haven't lost it yet
I just need to be honest with myself
And all the times I've used my shoulder to wipe away the tears
I vowed to see you with nobody else, or else
Apology accepted, erase what's in the past
You need me you don't need them
And in spite of my mistakes, I've learned there's so much more I can take
I can't believe what I'm saying
Then it hits me, fooled again
Into thinking, we'd be more than friends
The messages you left for me, will all go unreturned
I need some time to think about the facts
I opened up my heart to you and you hid yours away
So silence is the best way to react, react
Apology accepted, erase what's in the past
You need me you don't need them
And in spite of my mistkes there's only so much I can take
I can't believe what I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying
