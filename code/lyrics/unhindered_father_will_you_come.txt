Song:

There's a love, forgetting my failures.
There's a hope, that's setting me free.
There's a light, defeating my darkness.

And there's redemption calling,
And causing all to sing

[Chorus:]
Father will You come and open up our eyes.
Fill us with Your love, renew us with Your life.
Consume us with Your Majesty, consume of with your majesty
Yeah...

(Spoken) God we worship You tonight, consume us right now in this moment Lord.

There's a peace, that's calming my waters.
There's a joy, that's setting me free.
He's the light defeating my darkness.

And there's redemption calling,
And causing all to sing

[Chorus:]
We're singing
[Chorus:]

(Spoken) right now lets lift our hands to the Lord, as we surrender our hearts, we surrender our lives to Him.
Let us join in with the angels tonight, let us join with the saints around the world.

Glory.
Honor.
And power.
Belong to you.

(We give it to you God)

To you! To you!
And we're singing

We're singing
[Chorus:]

Consume us with Your Majesty

Honor.
And power.
Belong to You.
