Song:

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now! How you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me!

He was bound to love you
When he heard you sing
Christine...

(Raoul and Christine singing:
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime,
Say the word and I will follow you.
Say you'll want me with you here, beside you,)

You will Curse the day you did not do
All that the phantom
Asked of you
