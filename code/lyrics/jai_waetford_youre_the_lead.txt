Song:

Lets go away together
Like we can do anything
I know we're safe cause well be
Far from it all
I hope that when I'm with ya
You can be yourself
Don't change for anything
No don't change

I'm counting the days
Til I see ya
And I can't wait any longer
I can hear my heart beating
It's getting louder

Cause in my head... 
Were like a movie playing on the big screen
And girl you're the lead
In my head... 
No one else missing standing right next to me
Girl can't you see you're the lead

My faith in this is endless
Because of how far we've come
You've changed
My whole perception of where I belong
I hope that can be there
Whenever you need me
I won't change for anything no
I won't change

I'm counting down the days
Til I see ya
And I can't wait any longer
I can hear my heart beating
It's getting louder

Cause in my head... 
Were like a movie playing on the big screen
And girl you're the lead
In my head... 
No one else missing standing right next to me
Girl can't you see you're the lead

You make me believe in love
Something greater above
You made me believe in love
Something greater above

In my head... 
Were like a movie playing on the big screen
And girl you're the lead
In my head... 
No one else missing standing right next to me
Girl can't you see you're the lead
You're the lead
