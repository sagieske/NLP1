Song:

John San what you can
La la Janette dance in sand
What's the mystery my son
Gypsy Dan Caravan
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan
It's part of history my son

Murder and rape with your power
The 10th revolution in far away days
It's come to this
A gypsy's kiss
All your power's gonna fade in the haze

Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed
The Senorita said
I'll drag yer lungs out through yer nose
Space truckers free and high
Teamsters get ya by and by
That should keep you on your toes

They got a gun at your head
But you ain't necessarily playing their
Game
They can't resist
A Gypsy's Kiss
All that's needed to drive them insane

John Wayne The Alamo
Crazy Horse Geronimo
I'll smoke a piece with you
Mind Body Heart and Soul
We got Rock and Roll
And there's nothing they can do

Hear the small voice of truth
Above the shouting despair of the crowd
What do you wish
A Gypsy's Kiss
Gets you strong for crying out loud
