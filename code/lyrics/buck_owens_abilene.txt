Song:

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town that I've ever seen.
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, sweet Abilene.

I set alone most every night
Watch the trains roll out of sight
Don't I wish they were carryin' me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene.

Abilene, Oh, Abilene
Prettiest town that I've ever seen.
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, sweet Abilene.

Crowded city, there ain't nothin' free
Nothin' in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
Back In Abilene, sweet Abilene.

Abilene, Oh, Abilene
Prettiest town that I've ever seen.
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, sweet Abilene.

Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene...
