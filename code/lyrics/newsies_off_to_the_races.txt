MEDDA & NEWSIES:
High times, hard times
Sometimes the living is sweet
And sometimes there's nothing to eat
But I always lands on my feet
So when there's dry times
I wait for high times and then
I put on my best
And I stick out my chest
And I'm off to the race's again!
MEDDA: (Spoken)
Hello, newsies. What's new?
MEDDA:
So your old lady don't love you no more
So you're afraid there's a wolf at your door
So you've got street rats that scream in your ear
MEDDA & NEWSIES:
You win some, you lose some
My dear,oh...
High times, hard times
Sometimes the living is sweet
And sometimes there's nothing to eat
But I always lands on my feet
So when there's dry times
I wait for high times and then
I put on my best
And I stick out my chest
And I'm off to the races again
MEDDA:
I put on my best!
NEWSIES:
I put on my best!
MEDDA:
And I stick out my chest
NEWSIES:
And I sticks out my chest
MEDDS:
And I'm off
NEWSIES:
And I'm off
MEDDA:
And I'm off
NEWSIES:
And I'm off
MEDDA:
And I'm off
ALL:
To the races again!
