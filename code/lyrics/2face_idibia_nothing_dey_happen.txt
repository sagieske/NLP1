My guy Na your eye you go sharpen oo bcos he like say he don dey happen, no shaken notin dey happen, Nobody won kpai, but dem won go heaven

I wal called for the money, it is not funny... Cos I gat to say is not busy at all at all... E I was you... I get busy cos I nor go fit afford to get lazy at all at all. Nor let opportunity pass you by you get to dey always continue to dey try, you get to try to dey always and mind bcos you no won Kpai b4 you die, lie lie I know say you dey like to dey jolly cos I see you for my body you dey shake e your body. I know say you go like to make e money to impress your body plus all of your family... There is no film trick involved inside... Reality my brother is the way dat be right, if I tell you say easy o Na setup. So now what you gat to do is raise up and get up. For what believe is stand up, if it seems dat you sleep and raise up, you gat to fight for yourself b4 you find yourself by yourself wit your hands up, you gat to be strong, you gat to hold on, you gat to keep keeping on, you gat to realize say it is all man for himself, dats Y I say.

[Chorus x2]

I wake up in the morning, I look up in the raising sun, there is no time to waste cos there is a lot of things that need to be done, and pray to God to give you the wisdom to understand where you come from, and pray to God to give you the strength that you need to proceed, hi... And the teach you to believe in yourself, teach you to depend on nobody else, teach to dey suji yourself, teach you to know that your health is your welfare, teach you to understand that your destiny is in your hands, teach you to dey shine your eye say and realize say it is all man for himself.

[Chorus x4]

No slacking, no hocking, keep walking no stopping, no playing keep moving, no shading, For what believe is stand up, if it seems dat you sleep and raise up, you gat to fight for yourself b4 you find yourself by yourself wit your hands up, you gat to be strong, you gat to hold on, you gat to keep keeping on, you gat to realize say it is all man for himself, dats Y I say.

[Chorus: Till Fade]
