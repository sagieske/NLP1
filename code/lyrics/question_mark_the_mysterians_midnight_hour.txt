Song:

Alright, I wanna tell you a story
'Bout a girl that lives by the railroad tracks
Yeah, I wanna tell you a story
'Bout a girl that lives by the railroad tracks

Oh, she's so fine, she's mine all mine
And that's no lie, yeah

I gotta take, gonna take her for a little ride
Gonna go round and round till the midnight hour
I'm gonna do it, all, all kinds of ways
And baby, that's no lie, till the midnight hour

She's so fine, she's mine all mine
And that's no lie
Alright, get to me now, yeah

She's so fine, she's all mine
And baby, that's no lie
She treats me kindly
And I want to keep her for the rest of my life

And we can have that midnight hour
Until the day that I die
Yeah, alright, see when that midnight [Incomprehensible]
Yeah, no lie, baby, Saturday night, yeah

We can have that midnight hour
Until the day that I die, wow yeah
Alright, Saturday night, yeah
No lie, baby
