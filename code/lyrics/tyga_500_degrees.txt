[Intro:]
New year, new year
New money, new money

My state of mind is something they can never take from me!
I seen the friends turn to foes when they need the checks
I seen girls turn to hoes when they’re needing s**.
Yeah, man I need the best!
On this road to success, ain’t no time for you to guess and rest
Or to take a break, there ain’t no time to wait
When it’s a n***a out there trying to take your place.
I swear I’m going all the way like the G man
The celebrating, party hard on the weekend
But right now, I still got a lot of work to do
They always tell me…do whatever you can work for you!
Bad b*****s I had a few!
I’m all alone at the top, so you know I got a perfect view!
People need to understand that I’m here to stay
Have your girl body aching like my name is Clay.
My inner circle get smaller every single day
Cause people wanna envy when you’re hotter than Montego Bay!
Ha ha ha nightmares every single day
I go do it while these other n****s run away.
Nowaday you don’t need talent, just to reach success
All you need is a fat a** and show the world your breasts
Hoes would be hoes, you already know
So shout out to the women that will be tricking all across the globe!
A lot of people say, “I’ll never be nothing! ”
Now they got their hands out like need something
They’ll be like, damn, I always knew you will make it big
I told those people they should hop on my f*****g d**k!

Hook:
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them none new!
Young… bbc,
Man, you’re f*****g with the crew!
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them non new
Yeah, I’m about to kill the game
And ain’t nothing you can do
Cause I’m putting on, going strong,
Working hard, so at the top I belong!
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them none new!
Young… bbc
Man, your’re f*****g with the crew!
Non new, non new!

I live my life like a dangerous zone
And sweet at night like it’s…
I put on for the city that I call my home
And take shots, sip some Henny when I feel alone.
Nothing new, man I swear that’s all I do
Now they know I’m in the game
So they’re about to get the blues!
And they knew my flow is sick,
So they’re about to catch the flue
And these b*****s gimmie brain, till I never had a clue
Yeah, Jules, who is you?
You ain’t nothing, I can see the lies
Your flow week, but you got some people by your side!
I love my past ways in the ashtray
Now I’m trying to be the world’s greatest like I’m cash clay!
I kill tracks on my bad days
When you rap it’s like nest and the cash play, you a** n***a!
Why do people always act like you live in terror?
Why is my only competition the man in the mirror

Hook:
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them none new!
Young… bbc,
Man, you’re f*****g with the crew!
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them non new
Yeah, I’m about to kill the game
And ain’t nothing you can do
Cause I’m putting on, going strong,
Working hard, so at the top I belong!
Non new, non new
Man, I tell them none new!
Young… bbc
Man, your’re f*****g with the crew!
Non new, non new!
