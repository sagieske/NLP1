Song:

Yeah~China White 
Listen 
Yeah~Yeah 

I got a feeling someone's gonna get hurt 
Selling your soul for a bag full of purified dirt 
Is gonna getcha your diamond rings 
Stretch out your purse strings 
But it's all over when the fat lady sings 

‘Cause you've been selling out the neighborhood 
You've pick the wrong place, brother, for dealing your goods 
You're going down fool, I promise you that 
I'll hit you twice, (even) before you can flinch, that's a fact 

‘Cause you’re punk, coming into my town 
I got no patience for you 
I don't care how many guns you got 
Coz I got Kung Fu and a badge 
I'll be whopping your ass 
From Shanghai to LA in economy class 

China White China White, I'm gonna take you down 
China White China White, And I'm not messing 'round 
China White China White, Before my chance is gone 
China White China White, Come on come on 

‘Cause you've been killing since the day you were born 
Offering good times bought and sold like a whore 
How many innocent will share your disease before you rest in peace 

You took the mother from an innocent child 
Under the covers left her body defiled 
And now you're showing up my part of town 
I wanna take you down Take you down 

~Repeat~ 

China White China White, Nobody's gonna stop me, man 
China White China White, man, I'm sick of this shit 
China White China White...
