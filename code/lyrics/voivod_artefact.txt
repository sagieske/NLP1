Song:

Strange,
Remains of an unknown race
Skulls with conical shape
A map of outer space
The place where they were based
Colored flying machines
Scaphander figurines
Helmets with uv shield
Correlation denied

Denied, denied
Cannot be certified
No need to find a clue
We can't handle the truth

Denied, denied
But scientists testified
Those who have the proof
Will be treated just liked fools

Denied, denied
Denied, denied

Weird,
Curiosity and fear
Images are so clear
The fine details appear
These things were not from here
It's right before your eyes
They once came from the sky
I never wonder why
Existence is denied

Denied, denied
A forgery for most
The file forever closed
Classified as a hoax

Denied, denied
By the time the work is done
Witnesses will be gone
Normality will go on

Denied, denied
Denied, denied

Search failed
No trace, I know why
I do know why
Blank page, erased, I know why
I do know why
Chopped tapes
Cold case, I know why
I do know why

Denied, denied
This is war here on earth
Denied, denied
The universe can wait
Denied, denied
We might just stay alone
Denied, denied
We'll stay numb, as we are

Sad,
But humans are so bad
And how much chance we had
We're only turning mad
There's nothing else to add
We should keep it this way
On our own we'll stay
That's what I have to say
Evolution denied
