Song:

Love, it's a special day
We should celebrate and appreciate
That you and me found something pretty neat
And I know some say this day is arbitrary

But it's a good excuse that I love to use
Baby, I know what to do
Baby, I will love you
I'll love you, I'll love you

Love, I don't need those things
I don't need no ring
I don't need anything
But you with me
'Cause in your company
I feel happy, oh so happy and complete

And it's a good excuse that I love to use
Baby, I know what to do
Baby, I will love you
I'll love you, I'll love you

Yeah, it's a good excuse that I love to use
Baby, I know what to do
Baby, I will love you
I'll love you, I'll love you

So won't you be my honey bee?
Giving me kisses all the time
Be mine, be my Valentine

So won't you be my honey bee?
Giving me sweet kisses all the time
Be mine, be my Valentine

Ohhh, Oh woah, Be my Valentine
