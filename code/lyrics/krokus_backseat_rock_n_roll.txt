Song:

I wanna kiss my baby in a cadillac
Drivin' by a chauffeur, sittin' in the back
Johnny you can drive us anywhere
Cause I need time before arrivin' there

Drivin' thru the city to the concert hall
Headin' for the sound, I hear some rock 'n' roll
I told the driver, come on let's go thru the door
I wanna do it to the music but I need some more

Hey now, backseat rock 'n' roll
Hey now, do it with your soul
Hey now, backseat rock 'n' roll
Hey now, do it with your soul

Drivin' thru the hall, straight ahead to the stage
The music's growin' high upon our lover's cage
She's rockin' me and I'm rollin' her
People peepin' thru the windows, I don't care

Chorus

With your soul
