Song:

Only ever really one story
A boy and a girl and a dream of the world, an apple, a kiss
A moment of sky, a moment you choose without knowing why
Burning like a fever inside you
The heat of your skin and the taste of your lips
A shadow, a storm, a darkening sky, the reason you live, the secret you
Hide
And God said the reason had hung from the tree, but I feel the reason
Hanging on me
I am free of my innocence, falling too far
I am helpless to change, I am hopelessly lost, I am all that you are
I've fallen from all I know to keep you here, I need you here
I wonder how far to go without you here
Only ever really one story
A boy and a girl and the end of the world, a secret, a kiss, a hole in
The sky
The reason you fall, the moment you fly
And God said the reason had hung from the tree, but I feel the reason
Hanging on me
I am free of my innocence, falling too far
I am helpless to change, I am hopelessly lost, I am all that you are
