Song:

I still believe in what you say
I still believe that it could work ok
But love is just another game you play
You'll never change your mind
You exist so free and clear
Let no one touch you let no one near
I think you're just someone afraid of fear
Or what you just might find
I can see them all lining up outside your front door
Filthy minds and terrible habits are interesting

[Chorus:]
Sure
O but look at me now if I've changed tell me how
O I'd do anything for you

I'm sick of fighting but I need you so
You tell me lies but I can't let go
I want to take you out but you say no
Think you're ashamed of me
You give me headaches o you got your gall
If it weren't for me you wouldn't have nuttin' at all
I fell for you 'caus you were nice and tall
I liked what I could see
I could be the keeper of fortunes if I was inclined
Let me know that you're standing beside me I'll give them a sign
O but

[Chorus:]

I could lead an army to victory or win in a race
I could do it if only I knew that you'd save me a place
O but

[Chorus:]
