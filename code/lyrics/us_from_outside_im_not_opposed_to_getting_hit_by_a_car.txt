Song:

Six feet as it marks the end of me,
I try to follow but the great men always lead.
The path ahead, encased in treachery.
And I can honestly say that I'm afraid.
(Someone had a nightmare here, it's written on an empty heart)

[Chorus:]
The separation of a brave man fallen hard,
Though quite indifferent knows the way is in his heart.

I've come to terms with the end.
(How the f**k is everyone just dead? How did it all just end?)
And I fall down, I know, though I know that I will stand again.
The children are watching us, they're watching us.
(Send in the monsters)

A desperate man will stop at nothing to erase all the burdens and mistakes
He caused to those that he embraced.
(Someone had a nightmare here, let's pray until it's over)

[Chorus:]

The sheltered and the wicked see no need for enemies... Enemies.
(How the f**k is everyone just dead? How did it all just end?)
Watch us all collapse into the dust from which we came.
(The children are) Watching Us.
Though I know. Though I know. (I'm binded by the words I've lost here)

So I sent this letter written to whoever with a map that leads to nothing,
Nothing at all.
I'm sorry to mislead you, Oh Well.
