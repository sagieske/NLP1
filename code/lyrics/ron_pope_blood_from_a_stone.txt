Song:

[Verse:]
Slow down, I don't understand
Why you are talking with your hands?
Leave me if you think you should go
I'll be fine, I'll be fine on my own

[Pre-Chorus:]
‘Cause when there's no feelings at all
And it looks like it hurts but I can't be quite sure
No, this engine will not drive you
To the place you'd like to go

[Chorus:]
You are trying to draw blood from a stone
You are trying to draw blood from a stone

[Verse:]
Cold earth shifting ‘neath my feet
Dark words, I guess you believe
Someday, maybe I will se
But now I'm blind, now I'm blind to what you need

[Pre-Chorus:]
‘Cause when there's no feelings at all
And it looks like it hurts but I can't be quite sure
No, this engine will not drive you
To the place you'd like to go

[Chorus:]
You are trying to draw blood from a stone
You are trying to draw blood from a stone

[Verse:]
Harsh wind screaming in my ears
God sent and maybe nothing's real
You pay all your debts in kind
Now it's time, now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time, now it's time to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus:]
‘Cause when there's no feelings at all
And it looks like it hurts but I can't be quite sure
No, this engine will not drive you
To the place you'd like to go

[Chorus:]
You are trying to draw blood from a stone
You are trying to draw blood from a stone
You are trying to draw blood from a stone
