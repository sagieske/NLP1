Song:

Hard to believe it, it's kinda amazing, but it's true, now that I needed
Someone so special, here comes you.
So how am I crazy, to say that I'm dreamin over you
Someone so special, how could you say this all so cruel.

So when your sayin that you need love
I look at you, and kinda smile
It's very? Baby, so maybe this will take awhile.

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With alittle love and squeezin and hold you close, girl it's drivin me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love

Now that we started, lets make a relationship at last
Getting to know you, with nothin to owe you so I ask
Lets keep this real simple, we know that material things won't last
Show me you love me, if anythings different, then I'll pass

So when your sayin that you need love
I look at you, and kinda smile
It's very? Baby, so maybe this will take awhile

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With alittle love and squeezin and hold you close, girl it's drivin me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With alittle love and squeezin and hold you close, girl it's drivin me crazy

All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love (all over love)
All over love

Cause all that I wish for, is just to be with you baby
With alittle love and squeezin and hold you close, girl it's drivin me crazy

All over love
All over love
All over love
All over love
