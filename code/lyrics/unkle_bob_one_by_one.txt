Song:

One by One
I suffer you gladly
One by One
You're all I don't need

And you couldn't see,
The wood from the tree
You're eyes are unkind,
So don't look at me.

One by One
I suffer you badly,
One by One
You're all I don't need

And life on the road,
It makes you feel old,
Remember the time when friends were around,
When friends were around when we were all friendsÂ¦

Is this the way to be?
Is this the way to be?

One by One
One by One
