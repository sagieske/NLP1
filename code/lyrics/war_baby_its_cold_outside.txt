Song:

Do do do do do do do do do do
Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside
Rain in my heart tells me it's cold outside yeah yeah
When I meet you baby everything was right right on time oh girl
It was beautiful when you were mine you were mine

Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside
Tears in my eyes tells me it's cold outside

When you kiss me your lips were sweet so sweet so sweet sweet as wine oh baby
It was wonderful when you were mine
(Sure was right when you held me tight) oh girl (loving you girl was out of sight)
(I know now what I didn't know then come on back and we can do it again yeah)

Since you've been gone baby it's cold outside
Pain in my head tells me it's cold outside wooh wooh
When you love me you make my love light shine you made it shine girl
You were eveything baby when you were mine

(Needs some more what I had before) oh girl
(Play it again 'cause I know the score)
(You my dream now I'm singing the blues)
(Let me back in 'cause I paid my dues) come on baby
(Sure was fine when you were mine loving you girl was right on time)
I was loving you
(Wish I did what I knew I should come back home and we can make it good)
(Sure was right when you held me tight loving you girl was out of sight)
(I know now what I didn't know then come on back and we can do it again)
Do it again
(You my dream now I'm singing the blues)
(Let me back in 'cause I paid my dues) come on baby
(Sure was fine when you were mine loving you girl was right on time)
I was loving you
(Wish I did what I knew I should come back home and we can make it good)
(Sure was right when you held me tight loving you girl was out of sight)
Need your loving loving baby
(I know now what I didn't know then come on back and we can do it again)
(Needs some more what I had before oh girl play it again 'cause I know the score)
(Be my dream let me back in 'cause I paid my dues) I paid my dues
