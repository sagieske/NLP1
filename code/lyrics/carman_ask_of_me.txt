Song:

I always hear My children when they bow to pray
I never fail to entertain all that they say
I mourn with every sorrow
I grieve with every pain
Yet all the while I'm strengthening and blessing them again
I want so much to be their Source from which they feed
For I and only I can give them what they need
That's why within the pages of My Written Word
Time and time again this simple line is often heard
Ask of Me, don't turn to any other
Can't you see? You'll never be a bother
Just believe that I can be your Answer, My beloved child
Ask of Me, don't search in other places
Can't you see? That I'll be your Oasis
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
And ask of Me
Eyes have not seen, nor ears have heard
All of the things that I preferred
For those that love Me
But only if you ask of Me
Ask of Me, don't turn to any other
Can't you see? You'll never be a bother
Just believe that I can be your Answer, My beloved child
Ask of Me, don't search in other places
Can't you see? That I'll be your Oasis
In that dry and thirsty world you live in
I'll be your cup of water if only you give in
And ask of Me
