(It's been confirmed that the aliens have landed.)

Worldwide Jesus domination
Love conquers all
Rise like a chosen generation
There's no stopping it all

Come on freaks let's go
Come on freaks let's go
Get all the freaks and let's go
Yeah, yeah

We're taking over the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're coming for your soul
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Change the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're taking over, over, over
Alien Youth

Get all the freaks, let's go
Get all the freaks and let's go

Do you believe that the aliens have landed?
We're everywhere you go
Infiltrate at the break of revolution
You can't stop the revival
And we're not going to leave this world alone
And we're not going to leave it yeah!

We're taking over the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're coming for your soul
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Change the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're taking over, over, over
Alien Youth

Come on freaks let's go
Get all the freaks and let's go
Come on freaks let's go
Get all the freaks and let's go

And we're not going to leave this world alone
And we're not going to leave it, yeah!
And we're not going to leave this world alone
And we're not going to lea-ea-ea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eave
Taken, taken, taken over the world

We're taking over the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're coming for your soul
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Change the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're taking over, over, over
We're taking over the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're coming for your soul
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
Change the world
We're the Alien Youth
We're taking over, over, over
Alien Youth
