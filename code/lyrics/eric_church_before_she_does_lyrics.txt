Song:

I believe that gas is too damn high
Ain't nothin' more American than Mama's apple pie
I believe in love, I believe in peace
But I don't believe we'll ever see it in that Middle East
I believe the Bible is cold hard fact
And I believe that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does

I believe the Sabbath is the day of rest
The tax man and the devil share the same address
I believe don't start if you're gonna quit
I believe in keep your mouth shut and carry a big stick
I believe dogs are better than cats
And I belive that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does

There's absolutely positively no doubt in my mind
That O. J. Did it, Lee Harvey didn't and she's really gone this time

I belive that cold cold beer
Tastes better on a barstool than it does anywhere
I believe hard work really makes the man
But everyone should wet a line every now and then
I believe it's best to pay in cash
And I believe that Jesus is comin' back
Before she does

There's absolutely positively no doubt in my mind
That O. J. Did it, Lee Harvey didn't and she's really gone this time

I believe she was a real good thing
Can you believe I let a girl like her get away
I believe she meant it the night she packed
And said Jesus is comin' back
Before she does
Before she does
Before she does
