Song:

It was like too much coffee
We'd been up for days on end
But now it seems we've lost it
I don't know where or how or when

If I could have those days again
I think I'd do things just the same

'Cause it's a fine line, a fine line
Between pleasure and pain
If just for one night
Hold tight
And save me again
I just want you to know
That it's hard to let you go
'Cause it's a fine line
Between pleasure and pain

We were perfect lovers
You'd be Bobby, I'd be Pam
Bobby found another
So he told me second hand

But if I could have those days again
I think I'd do things just the same

'Cause it's a fine line, a fine line
Between pleasure and pain
If just for one night
Hold tight
And save me again
I just want you to know
That it's hard to let you go
'Cause it's a fine line
Between pleasure and pain

I could smooth things over
God knows I know how to act
I'll love you like I mean it
Why can't you love me back?

'Cause it's a fine line, a fine line
Between pleasure and pain
If just for one night
Hold tight
And save me again
'Cause it's a fine line, a fine line
Between pleasure and pain
If just for one night
Hold tight
And save me again
I just want you to know
That it's hard to let you go
The fondest memories, they say,
Is what remains

It's a fine line
Between Pleasure and Pain
