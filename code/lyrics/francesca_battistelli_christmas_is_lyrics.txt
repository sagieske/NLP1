Song:

Christmas is music and family in town
Christmas is snoopy and Charlie brown
It's anticipating that snows going to fall
And praying for someplace to park at the mall
It’s mom going crazy cuz the turkey got burned
It saying thanks for some gift you’ll return
Christmas is caroling kids at your door
It's paper and ribbon all over the floor

Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I’ve been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here

Christmas is rooftops covered in lights
It’s away in the manger, It’s a wonderful life
Christmas is caring for those who got nothing
It’s dropping your change in the bell ringers bucket

Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I’ve been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here

(music) count

Christmas is all of these fun things for sure
But, Christmas is really, oh so much more
It’s good news of hope for the whole world to because
Christmas is Jesus

Christmas is coming, Christmas is near
I’ve been counting down the days
I’ve been counting down the days
I’ve been counting down the days all year
Christmas is almost here
