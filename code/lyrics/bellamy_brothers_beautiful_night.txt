Song:

Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night

The moon's glowing silver
Down on blue water
Sweet meditation bathes me in white
I feel His spirit and I relive creation
I feel His blessings
This beautiful night

Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night

Quiet takes over, blends with our voices
Just stillness and prayer
While the angels unite
He is our rock He is our refuge
He is our savior
This beautiful night

Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night

And when morning breaks
His light again shines
Fulfilling our souls
So warm and so bright
But come again evening
We'll gather our loved ones
And lift up our voices
This beautiful night

Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night

Beautiful night
Stars shining down
All of God's glory
All around
The rains gone away
And there's no clouds in sight
We're singing His praises
This beautiful night
