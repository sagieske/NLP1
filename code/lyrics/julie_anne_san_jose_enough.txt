Song:

Remember those time we had
The good, the happy and sad
I never thought we got around
When things went tumbling down

I guess we got lonely
There was no one else for us to turn to
‘Cause I don’t need you any longer
‘cause now I’m stronger

Enough no more
It’s time for you to be on your way
Time’s up. Get out
No need for us to figure it out
Let go. Move on.
It’s time to go our separate ways
Enough be gone
The hurt and pain will only remain

Stop tryin’ to call me
Stop messin’ with my mind
Oh why can’t you see?
That there’s nothing else you will find

‘cause we’ll only keep on fighting
And our hearts will only keep on hurting
Tell me who are we fooling with our selfish pride
So…

Enough no more
It’s time for you to be on your way
Time’s up. Get out
No need for us to figure it out
Let go. Move on.
It’s time to go our separate ways
Enough be gone
The hurt and pain will only remain

Stay away – that’s the only way
It’s gonna get better
Till the clouds settle

Find a way – for our hearts to be sober
And someday I hope and I pray
Maybe we could be good friends
Take a turn at this dead end

This is enough
Yeah we fuss and fight
What a damage we’ve done
And I knew that we ain’t gon’ make it right
Looking at the mirror
This body and mind is wasted
And now I just feel so ashamed to feel like I’ve be chasing
The love I never thought would last
I guess that was the past
I remember all the memories and things we used to have
I’m moving on, but you keep coming back
It’s too late it’s too late
‘cause it’s over yeah

Enough no more
It’s time for you to be on your way
Time’s up. Get out
No need for us to figure it out
Let go. Move on.
It’s time to go our separate ways
Enough be gone
The hurt and pain will only remain
