Song:

Closer than close (Oh... Whoa, you know)
(Somethin' I wanna say, baby)
Closer than close (Whoa... Oh...)
(Ooh, hoo)

Powder your pretty nose
Put some polish on your toes
And then slip into somethin' fine
It's our time, baby

Put everything aside
I'm telling you to let it ride
'Cause tonight is yours and mine
You don't have to say it

I know that you've been neglected
More than I would care to mention
But tonight that's gonna be corrected
You'll get my complete attention

And we're gonna be closer than close
Part of one another
So into each other
We're more than lovers
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
For now and ever

We're gonna do the town
We're gonna turn it upside down
And then I'm gonna bring you home
Oh, look out now, baby

Then what I'm gonna do
Is get down and make love to you
For all those nights you spent alone
You don't have to tell me

I know what we've got together
And I was crazy to abuse it
I want for us to have forever
There's no way I wanna lose it, girl, I wanna be

Closer than close (A little bit closer to you, darlin')
Part of one another (Part of you, baby)
So into each other (So much more)
We're more than lovers (We're so much more than lovers)
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
For now and ever

Closer than close (Baby, I just wanna love you)
Closer than close (Love you all night long)
Closer and closer (Wanna take you in my arms and get closer and closer and closer)
And closer, baby, closer (Oh... Oh...)

Oh... Oh... I wanna be

Closer than close (I wanna be closer to you, baby)
Part of one another (Hold you all night)
So into each other (Hold you all night long, baby)
We're more than lovers (Whoa, more than lovers)
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
(All I wanna do, all I wanna do is kiss you and hug you and squeeze you and love you, baby)

Closer than close
Part of one another
So into each other (So into each other)
We're more than lovers (Oh, more than lovers)
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
(I wanna be, don't you wanna be, girl, we've got to be)

Closer than close
Part of one another (Part of one another)
So into each other (So much more)
We're more than lovers (So much more than lovers)
But closer than most
Baby, even closer than close
(Oh, my baby, yeah, my baby, oh... Ho...)
