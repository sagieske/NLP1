Song:

Decisions decisions
My minds blowing into the screen
Television disrupting the sound of the tears
In the kitchen where my mom first threw a knife at me
Mom I said I was sorry
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away

Suck it up kid
Youre about to die anyway
Your dads wasted
Your moms on crack
Your brothers g**
Never mind that
Take a 22 to your mouth
And blow your brains out
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away

I'm drowning here
To seal the flame
Were happy I will seee you all in hell
I can't stop there
To say again
The reason were blown away

Away
Away
Away

Decisions decisions
My minds blowing into the screen
Television disrupting the sound of the tears
Never mind that
Take a 22to your mouth
And blow your brains out
I'm sitting alone
I need someone to hold
My heart hurts
Decisions to make
Am I ready to take my life away
