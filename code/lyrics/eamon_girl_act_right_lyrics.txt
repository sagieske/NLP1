Song:

Yeah, uh, common

When I first met you
You were so unique
Like what I seen
Let a few weeks go
You had me crazy
When we would meet
Why you gonna act like
You ain't been trained yet
But boot I bet
If I take you out
You won't act like my lady should

[Chorus:]
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up

You should know by now
When I take you out
You act proper
When we at places
You know your place
When ho's holler
F**k that s**t
You know the rules
Every girl that I f**k
Is put through school
But I still feel like you won't
Act like my lady should

[Chorus:]
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up

Hey trick
Better start acting right (oh)
Swallow
You will never taste it right (oh)
Hey trick
Better start acting right (oh)
Swallow
You will never taste it right (oh)

[Chorus:]
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up

Hey trick
Better start acting right (oh)
Swallow
You will never taste it right (oh)
Hey trick
Better start acting right (oh)
Swallow
You will never taste it right (oh)

[Chorus:]
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up
When you come please girl act right
Don't try none of your crazy s**t tonight
So when you come please girl act right
I don't give a f**k you been acting up
