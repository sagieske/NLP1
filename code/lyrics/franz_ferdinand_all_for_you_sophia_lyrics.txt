Song:

Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, Europe's going to weep
All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia (x4)

Bang bang, history's complete
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo

All for you, all for you, all for you, Sophia (x4)

The Black Hand holds the gun
The devil takes his run
Urban, take the Appel Quay
It's June the twenty-eighth
The seventh was for me

Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip
Bang bang, shoot me Gavrilo
