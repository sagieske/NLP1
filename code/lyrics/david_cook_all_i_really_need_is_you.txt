Song:

After all these years
After all these tears between us
Still I couldn't find
Someone half as right as you

And each time I stop to think
What it is I really need

Heres what I conclude
All I really need is you

Just say what you want to say
You don't have a chance in the world
Can I, knowing how I've tried
Still come close to losing you, girl
Have I spent so many nights
Trying but in vain to tell you
Don't you know it's true
All I really need is you

How was I to know
Wed have ended here
Where we finally did
You tied your life to mine
Once upon a starry night
And when someone asks for me
What it is that I believe

Say, I believe it's true
All I really need is you

Just say what you want to say
You don't have a chance in the world
Can I, knowing how I've tried
Still come close to losing you, girl
When you are my world
Have I spent so many nights
Trying but in vain to tell you
Feelings come and go
Me, I'm never gonna ever let you go

Promise you I'm gonna always love you so
Cause all I really need is you
