Song:

16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with
D**k Brave "Walk This Way"
I need a quick drink more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing boogie woogie chili honey

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home

16 hours on my back in a corner and an empty bottle of Jack and a b***h
Well I'm sorry to inform you that the poison in my body guiding you
To walk away from this mess
I need a quick drink more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing boogie woogie chili honey

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home

16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with
D**k Brave "Walk This Way"
I need a quick drink more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing boogie woogie chili honey

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
I would love to bring you home
