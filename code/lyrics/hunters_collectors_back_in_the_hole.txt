Song:

When the day shift is over
There'll be fear in the pipeline tonight
All the prisoners are restless
Locked up from dusk to daylight

Well how can you blame them?
I get pretty close myself sometimes
I know the score, I know the feeling
Isolation for canteen crimes

Still I gotta keep my shirt on
Gotta wait for the nerves to unwind
I gotta get control again
Gotta let the blood boil in my mind

But you don't take it out on your children
Honey I won't take my work home tonight
On the weekend I'm gonna have a good one
Cause I'll be back in the hole in the morning light

When the schoolboy's witch hunt is over
He's gonna tell us that the system is wrong
But I'll still be working in the cold Coburg air
We've had it too easy for too long

I'm on my way home now
To face up to the rest of my life
Hot water and a home cooked meal
And send kind regards to my wife

But you don't take it out on your children
Honey I won't take my work home tonight
On the weekend I'm gonna have a good one
Cause I'll be back in the hole in the morning light
