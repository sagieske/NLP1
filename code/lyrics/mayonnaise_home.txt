Song:

In your eyes,
I can, fly
Soon we'll see,
Things we can't find.

It's just another day,
To see them go away,
To them that they may
Always find their way.
I am alone again,
With no one to ammend,
On my knees, begging please,
Come back home.

Through the door,
Teardrops fall.
Wear me now,
Kingdom come.
