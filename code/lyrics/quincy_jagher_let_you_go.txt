Song:

Uhhh Uhhh Ohhh!

I Spend my nights alone
Wishing you would come back home (Yeaah)
I Apologize that cuz I know that I have done you wrong (Yeah)
And I don't wanna spend another day
Thinking about the games I played
Girl I'm about to go insane yeaah!

Pre Chorus:

Did you get my message shawty
Just called to say I'm sorry
And I just can't believe
That you just up and leave me
And girl these words are true
I wrote this song for you
So baby tell me what I'm suppose to do Yeaah!

Chorus:

I'm sitting back is waiting for your call back
Cuz I know the way I did you was all back
I aint heard from you lately
It's driving me crazy
Missing my baby,
It's making it hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
(Goo ohhh ohhh)
Oooo, I can't let you go just can't let you go
Making it hard for me to let you go

Verse one:

I remember when you said
You'll be there always there for me
You know when the times got back you'll never leave me alone
On the day you left me it ripped me apart
Just to thought I'll be without you
Girl it tears me in my heart (hey)

Pre Chorus:

Did you get my message shawty
Just called to say I'm sorry
Without you I just can't believe
That you just up and leave (ooohh)
And girl my words are true
I wrote this song for you

So baby tell me what I'm supposed to dooo! (ohhh)

Chorus:

I'm sitting back is waiting for your call back
Cuz I know the way I did you was all back
I aint heard from you lately
It's driving me crazy
Missing my baby,
It's making it hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
(Goo ohhh ohhh)
Oooo, I can't let you go just can't let you go
Making it hard for me to let you go

Verse Two:

I know I did you wrong
Don't give up girl I can change
Just listen up before you walk away
Let me explain
These girls are like a drug and I'm addicted
Back then I needed time and space
To find what I was missing (ohh)

But your the one I want
The only one I love
Your the only one I'm thinking off
Baby! Please don't go! Your making it
Hard for me to let you gooo!

Chorus:
I'm sitting back is waiting for your call back
Cuz I know the way I did you was all back
I aint heard from you lately
It's driving me crazy
Missing my baby,
It's making it hard for me to let you go
It's so hard for me to let you go
(Goo ohhh ohhh)
Oooo, I can't let you go just can't let you go
Making it hard for me to let you go

Echo: gooo...

Beat plays all away though...
