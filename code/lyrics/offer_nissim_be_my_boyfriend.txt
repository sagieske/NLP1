Song:

Your eyes are breaking walls
Towards my direction
I feel the wind blows
I'm standing here it's cold
I want you to hold
You have no clue
How much I want you
No idea how much I need you here
I want you to hold

So what you wanna do do
Boy I want you to to
Be my boyfriend
You're messing with my head head
Boy I want you bad bad
Be my boyfriend

I'm so lost without you
Baby what would I do
Everywhere I want to go over I see you
I'm so lost without you
Baby what would I do
Everywhere I want to go over I see you
