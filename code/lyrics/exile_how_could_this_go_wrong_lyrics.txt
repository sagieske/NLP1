Song:

Dancing, romancing
But no second chancing
Nothing more
Running and hiding
Slipping and sliding
Across the floor

She comes alone every night
On her own looking for romance
She stands there watching
While everyone's touching
She'd take a chance
Standing there waiting, anticipating

How could this go wrong
So many lovers holding on
How could this go wrong
Another night goes on and on

Now everyone's faking
Hearts have been breaking
Across the floor
He's on the making
She's for the taking
Nothing more

From the look in her eyes
She is desperately searching
For something to say
And as he calls her over
They're getting closer
She'll find a way

Looking for something
Suddenly touching

How could this go wrong
It's what she needed all along
How could this go wrong
And so the night goes on and on

Dancing, romancing
No second chancing
Across the floor
He's on the making
She's for the taking
Nothing more

Still she comes alone
Every night on her own
Looking for romance
She stands there watching
While everyone's touching
She'd take a chance

Standing there waiting
Anticipating
Looking for something
Suddenly touching

How could this go wrong
She thought he loved her all along
How could this go wrong
So many lovers holding on

How could this go wrong
She thought he loved her all along
How could this go wrong
And so the night goes on and on
