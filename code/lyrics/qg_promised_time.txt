(Yung jj)
You ain't gotta cry.
(You don't have to cry)
We gone get it right.
(We gone get it right.)
Ain't getting back the time,
But we gone get it right.
Get it right, get it right, get it right

Chorus 2x

Q. G
(Yung jj)

You ain't gotta cry, when I say goodbye.
(You don't have to cry)
Know I gotta get it, living like it's promised time.
(We gone get it right)
Gotta double up my hustle, ain't getting back the time.
Time worth more than money & you ain't wasting mine.
(Get it right x3)

Q. G Verse

Oh my, my, damn look how time flown.
Yeah it's been awhile, let me tell you what I'm on.
Please no condolences, probably heard my pops gone.
Yeah it broke my heart, Had me in a twilight zone.
Still rollin' up green, Countin' what I can.
They say work hard, that's what makes a man.
Either way you sketch it, ethics always in the plan.
But sometimes things change and it can change him.
I mean man it changed me, but damn can you blame me.
Drive on life's highway, come and chase me.
Thought I was invincible never replace me.
Damn, I guess I'm crazy!
Woke up now you hate me?
But, s**t I'm just tryna live.
Hit a beach, enjoy the sands they say get it how you live!
All my life I dreamed big, time to hit em with a deadline. Before a n***a meet his deadline I'm just tryna grind!

Chorus 2x

Q. G
(Yung jj)

You ain't gotta cry, when I say goodbye.
(You don't have to cry)
Know I gotta get it, living like it's promised time.
(We gone get it right)
Gotta double up my hustle, ain't getting back the time.
Time worth more than money & you ain't wasting mine.
(Get it right x3)

Yung jj Verse

I know I messed up. I know, I know, I know.
I made them promises, that I wouldn't go back to what I used to do.
Serve them blocks, yeah moving rocks, didn't know what I was doing, but I was on them blocks
Tryna make that gwap.
Young n***a 14, chilling with them og's.
Only if I knew then what I know now.
Probably wouldn't do what I do now.
But I'm ok, I made it my way.
N****s hated down the way, but I guess that's how it goes.
In the city of the snow. Where it gets below zero.
For that one to po
To pour another four, double cup yeah ya know,
I like my life slow
Motion
Cause emotions got me open, said you know I got that potion.
Yeah you know I stay straight smoking (uh huh) on a daily basis man yeah you know I gotta straight maintain in this game.

Chorus 2x

Q. G

(We gone get it right)
Gotta double up my hustle, ain't getting back the time.
Time worth more than money & you ain't wasting mine.
(Get it right x3)since I saw your face
Is take your hand and run away, with someone like you
