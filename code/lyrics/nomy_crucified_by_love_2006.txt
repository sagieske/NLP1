Song:

Erase my name, from the past
So many years have gone so fast
So Take this life and be gone
You are no longer my number one

You made me live hoped you'de stay
Never knew what she was about to say

I'm sorry for the time
You still one of a few
I'm sorry you were mine
I'm crucified by you

And What we had was fine
God was crying blood
Yeah life are left behind
I'm crucified by love

It turned out you're no longer mine
Without a whisper and without a sign

Nail me nail me to the cross
Oh baby fail me fail me just for us

Haunt me Haunt me in my dream
Oh baby thrill me kill me sins redeem

I'm sorry for the time
You still one of a few
I'm sorry you were mine
I'm crucified by you

And What we had was fine
God was crying blood
Yeah life are left behind
I'm crucified by love

I'm crucified by you
I'm crucified by you
But life is on it's way
Yeah life is on it's way
