Song:

Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
Darling Je vous aime beaucoup
That in french means I love you
Yo te quiero mi amor
That's what they say on the spanish shore
But oh my darlin' what can I say
The right words just won't come my way
All the words in the world
Could never tell you I love you
Io ti amo they agree
Is the proper thing in Italy
Ich liebe Dich mein Frulein
That's the way the germans say the same old line
And though I try I can't express
The way you fill my heart with happiness
All the words in the world
Could never tell you I love you
Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
Ooh All the words in the world
I could spend my time
Learning every line in Webster's dictionary
I could go from A to Z
But still I couldn't tell you what you mean to me
I could search for a million ways
But I know I'd never find the phrase
I looked around but I regret
The words I need weren't written yet
And so my darlin' please take my hand
Tell me, tell me, tell me, that you understand
All the words in the world
Could never tell you I love you
