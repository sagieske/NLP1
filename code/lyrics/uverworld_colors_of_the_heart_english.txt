Song:

That day, my heart collapsed without making a sound.
Even if I scream as I break, these unerasable memories
And this darkness will flow into my eyes.
I still can't see these colors, so I'll still feel depressed tomorrow.

I searched endlessly for the day when we could understand each other.
I'll keep on living now just so that I can lose it.
It's impossible to be alone, even if I embrace this solitude.
If you turn on the lights...
I will shine toward the light.

"These feelings we keep wishing for will one day change color"
You told that to the person who can keep going on inside my heart.
Just about everything is inevitable inside these colors that were born.
One more time, I am able to paint tomorrow with my hands.

In that place from some time, I'll have to get used to losing things.
These things I've taken will all slip through my fingers.
Before these tears dry up, will those words I wanted to hear
Be used now to save someone?
It's all your fate. You gonna do that.

"If this light becomes bright, the darkness will become deep too."
Even if we realized that, there is nothing to fear.
Just about everything is in the end of my heart.
If I open my eyes, I'll be able to once again see these colors that were born.

The breath of sadness;
That is what makes these colors we've searched for run
Without raising a sound.

"These feelings we keep wishing for will one day change color"
You told that to the person who can keep going on inside my heart.
Just about everything is inevitable inside these colors that were born.
One more time, the fingertips of this light will shine on me.

Just drawing... Colors in light and darkness
And take it... Colors in light and darkness
Now, with these hands,
I will once again paint all of these unreachable, kind colors.
