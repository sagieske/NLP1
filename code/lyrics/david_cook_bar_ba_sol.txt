Song:

When I woke up, I could see
The daylight had already passed me
It was such a fight to fade away to sleep
It's a fugue I'm on, falling to chase down the dawn
And I fell every night,
As it turns into light with my eyes just shut tight

Sailing all alone, I thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away

Oh where I've been sold and spun again
All before me like a dream, fallin' in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous,
I know just what I did to deserve this
Oh I know it's not a dream

Keepin' quiet, layin' low, holdin' on to what I don't want to know
Til the daylight turns to ash and blows away
Missin' keys, bloody nose, consequences of what I chose
Keep on runnin' into me, don't want my memory, it all comes so deaf'ning

Sailing all alone, thought I'd made it home
But I threw it all away

Oh where I've been, sold and spun again
All before me like a dream, fallin' in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous,
I know just what I did to deserve this
Oh I know it's not a dream

Oh where I've been, sold and spun
Oh where I've been, sold and spun again
All before me like a dream, fallin' in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous,
I know just what I did to deserve this
Yeah I know it's not a dream

Oh where I've been, sold and spun again
All before me like a dream, fallin' in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous,
I know just what I did to deserve this
Oh I knew it's not a dream
