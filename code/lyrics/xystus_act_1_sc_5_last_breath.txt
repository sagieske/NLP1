Song:

[Diegu:]
This is it... 
My life is frail and bruised
I've never known what others knew
But now I know - what's left to do?
I've followed my path

Through sour & sweet
Travelled along without questioning all
I've been told... 
Guided by faith

[Diegu, Death:]
Look at me
And see my eyes being dimmed
Grab my hand
I'm not sure I can withstand

[Death:]
Some tend to give while others take
It matters not: there is no escape

[Diegu:]
All that remains is for me to die
To follow through to the other side

[Death:]
Aaargh... What is this?
I can't take you down! 
This cannot be! 
No one defies me! 

[Diegu:]
I've never felt more alive:
Rising up in front of Death's eyes

[Diegu, Death:]
Grab my hand
And feel my strength within
Look at me
And we see a new beginning

[Diegu:]
I seldom smile, 
Often I cry... 
The sour-sweet of tears, seldom I taste
My lips are dry

When Death passed me by
It flashed before my eyes
I've seen how we will thrive
My heart is filled with hope
I won't be overthrown
I must not feel afraid - oh no I won't! 

[Death:]
It is I who holds the Sceptre of Death
Heed my words

[Diegu:]
I will smother
Your very last breath
