Song:

Look up on the wall, there on the floor,
Under the pillow, behind the door.
There's a crack in the mirror.
Somewhere there's a hole in a window-pane.
Do you think I'm to blame?
Tell me do you think I'm to blame?

(when they do it) you're never there.
(when they show it) you stop and stare.
(abacab) he's in anywhere.
(abacab)

If you're wrapping up the world
Cos youve taken someone elses girl,
When they turn on the pillow,
Even when they answer the telephone,
Don't you think that by now,
Tell me, don't you think that by now.

(when they do it) you're never there.
(when they show it) you stop and stare.
(abacab) he's in anywhere.
(abacab) doesnt't't really care.

You want it, you got it, you gotta go
You want it, you got it, now you know

Its an illusion, it's a game,
Or reflection of someone elses name.
When you wake in the morning,
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane.

Well, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere.
Now there's a hole in there somewhere.

(when they do it) you're never there.
(when they show it) you stop and stare.
(abacab) he's in anywhere.
