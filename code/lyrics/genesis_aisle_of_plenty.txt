Song:

I don't belong here, said old tessa out loud.
Easy, love, there's the safe way home.
- thankful for her fine fair discount, tess co-operates

Still alone in o-hell-o
- see the deadly nightshade grow

English ribs of beef cut down to 47p lb
Peek freans family assorted from 17 1/2 to 12
Fairy liquid giant - slashed from 20p to 17 1/2
Table jellys at 4p each
Anchor butter down to 11p for a 1/2
Birds eye dairy cream sponge on offer this week.

Its scrambled eggs.
