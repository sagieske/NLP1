Song:

Miss Jess
Some say we shouldn't be out here rockin' the world
Some say we're better off staying daddy's little girls
Some say, some say, some say
Some say we're only about those diamonds and pearls
But I'm here to tell ya these tracks gonna bring us the world
I say, I say, I say, I say

Not gonna walk on thin ice
When you tell me I'm wrong and you're right
You can say whatever you like
But girls do what girls do
Not gonna do what you want
You keep thinkin' I will but I won't
Stop thinking I do when I don't
'Cause girls do what girls do

You say you really don't like the clothes that I wear
Too little too short too tight, do you think that I care
You say, you say, you say, you say

Not gonna walk on thin ice
When you tell me I'm wrong and you're right
You can say whatever you like
But girls do what girls do
Not gonna do what you want
You keep thinkin' I will but I won't
Stop thinking I do when I don't
'Cause girls do what girls do

Some say, some say, some say, yeah
Some say, some say, some say, yeah
Miss Jess, press this
Some say, some edit it, some edit it

Not gonna walk on thin ice
When you tell me I'm wrong and you're right
You can say whatever you like
But girls do what girls do
Not gonna do what you want
You keep thinkin' I will but I won't
Stop thinking I do when I don't
'Cause girls do what girls do

Not gonna walk on thin ice
When you tell me I'm wrong and you're right
You can say whatever you like
Girls do what girls do
Not gonna do what you want
You keep thinkin' I will but I won't
Stop thinking I do when I don't
Girls do what girls do

That's what some say
