Song:

Angel is a girl with short brown hair
Simple little face and simple clothes she wears
Angel isn't much for idle conversation
Doesn't care about the weather or the newest sensation

Angel spends her nights giving of herself
To the little blue hairs in silver chairs
Who cannot help themselves

Angel is an angel on the inside
You and I may not see from the outside
Oh I pray that in time, oh that our eyes
Will see past an angel's disguise.

Martin is a man with four kids and a wife
Living out his average days in an average nine to five
Well, now he's no superman as the modern world perceives
But he wouldn't think twice to give his life for his family

Angels of love come in many different ways
Do we ignore the art of the purest heart?
'Cause we just don't like the frame

Angel is an angel on the inside
You and I may not see from the outside
Oh I pray that in time, oh that our eyes
Will see past an angel's disguise.

From high upon out throne
What goes deeper than the skin?
Do we wait to cast the stone?
