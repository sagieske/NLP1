Song:

Every time you go away I know
It won't be for long though it seems,
And all the time we spend apart
That ticking tock clock seems to last for weeks.

Well I guess it won't be wrong
To expect you to climb up here each week,
Yes I guess it ain't so long
Four hours on a bus for you's a treat.

And it wont be long
And it wont be long
All day long I sit here,
All day long I sit here,
All day long I sit here,
Thinkin' 'bout you.

Yes I know there's a million miles
And aeroplanes, they keep us apart,
But when I sit alone at night on my bus
Darling well your in my heart.

And it won't be long
And it wont be long
All day long I sit here,
Thinkin' 'bout you.

So complicated times have passed,
I'm sorry babe I feel the same for you.
Yes I know I broke it off but I'm sorry babe
Ya just didn't stay true.

And it wont be long
And it wont be long
All day long I sit here,
Thinkin' 'bout you.
