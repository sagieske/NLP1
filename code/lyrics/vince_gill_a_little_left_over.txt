Song:

I work my fingers to the bone
But you won't hear me cry and moan
A workin' man don't need no welfare line

Well I'll never be a millionaire
And frankly I don't even care
'cause all I need to have a real good time

Is a little left over
On saturday night
If my bills are paid my plans are made
And everything's alright
Put on my ropers and them wranglers fittin' tight
Got a little left over
And it's saturday night

I don't drink but I love to dance
With those sweet young things in their cowboy hats
These country girls will be the death of me
If that's the way I gotta go
Lord I hope I die real slow
'till I do I'll tell you all I need

Chorus
