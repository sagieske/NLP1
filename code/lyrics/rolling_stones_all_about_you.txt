Song:

All About You (Emotional Rescue - Glimmer Twins)

Well if you call this a life
Why must I spend mine with you
If the show must go
Let it go on without you
I'm so sick and tired of hanging around with jerks like you

Who'll tel me those lies
And let me think that it's true
What am I to do
You wanted it I got it too

Well the laughs may be cheap
That's just cause the joke's about you
I'm so sick and tired of hanging around with dogs like you
You're the first to get blamed
Always the last bitch to get paid

Oh, tell me those lies
Let me think they're true
I heard one or two
They weren't about me, they weren't about her
They were all about you

And I may maybe miss you
But missing me just isn't you
I'm so sick and tired hanging around with dogs like you

Tell me those lies
Let me think they're true
I heard one or two, and they weren't about me, they weren't about her
They're all about you, all about you

I'm so sick and tired
What should I do
You want it, you get it...

So how come I'm still in love with you?
