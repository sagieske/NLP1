Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
I wanna stay here by your side
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
All day, all night
I wish that I could be a star
I wish that I could be wherever you are
Now I know in my life
There's only one who makes me feel
So good
You make me feel so right
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
I wanna stay here by your side
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
All day, all night
I know Im not supposed to cry
As silly as it seems
My tears will never dry
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
I wanna stay here by your side
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
All day, all night
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
I wanna stay here by your side
Oooh
Dam dibi dam dibi doe bee dajee
All day, all night
