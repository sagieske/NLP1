Song:

I feel delirious
Come let's get out of here
We're so anonymous
But it's all coming clear
We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it
Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything

I will pose if I wanna and
I will vogue like madonna
I might not dance like mj, rip
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything, yes everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything yeah, oh

We don't ever stop
Let's watch the sun come up
We'll sleep when we're dead
Cause halfway kind of sucks
We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it
Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything.

I will pose if I wanna and
I will vogue like madonna
I might not dance like mj, rip
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything, yes everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything yeah, oh

[Bridge:]
Hold onto me and I'll hold onto you
Don't over think, what have we got to lose?
It's me and you, me and you no matter what
Oooh...

We're heading for the sky
And we'll get lost in it
Cause all I want, all I want, all I want is everything.

I will pose if I wanna and
I will vogue like madonna
I might not dance like mj, rip
But I will give the best of me

All I want is everything, yes everything
Too much is not enough
I'm sick of settling for in between
And I'm not giving up
As long as it feels right
At least we know that we're alive
All I want is everything, yes everything yeah, ohhh...
