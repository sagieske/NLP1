Song:

You say good morning, and good evening
The day is done, and you've come to find
The words are fleeting, I hear your quiet breathing
Is something wrong?

You come on two knees, with more than two needs
Finding that it's all too easy
To be helped and found
You slept and he said

(Chorus)
It is in you, to carry on
It is in you, to lay down fears that hold
It is in you, to find your way home

Daylight's coming, the sun is blazing
New beginnings seep into you
But in the end it's distant shadows
That finally overwhelm your senses
And this time around
Is it love that you crown?
And this time around
You'll be more than who you are

(Chorus)
It is in you, to carry on
It is in you, to lay down fears that hold
It is in you, to find your way home

[Guitar]
[Drums]

Whoa oh oh oh...
(Repeats)

Could you find yourself a way home? (4x)

(Chorus)
It is in you, to carry on
It is in you, (ohh) to lay down fears that hold
It is in you, (ohh) to find your way home
