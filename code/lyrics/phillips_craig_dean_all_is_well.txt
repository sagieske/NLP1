Song:

Verse 1:
Hear the heart of Adam's prayer
In the hold of Satan's snare.
But there is hope, and grace will tell:
God has a plan, and all is well.

Verse 2:
Every son of Adam's race
Felt the grip of Satan's chains;
When the Lamb came to Earth's cell,
He broke the chains, and all is well.

Chorus:
All is well! All is well!
Praise the Lamb! All is well!
He holds the keys of Death and Hell!
Jesus reigns, and all is well!

Verse 3:
To the cross I will come,
A sinner weak and undone.
God will break the tempter's spell,
And I will sing for all is well!

[Chorus:]

Bridge:
We sing hallelujah! Hallelujah, Hallelujah! (4x)

Verse 4:
With this cup, with this bread,
We proclaim Your death.
The cross was raised and evil fell;
Death has died, and all is well!

[Chorus:]

All is well! Praise the Lamb! All is well!
He holds the keys of Death and Hell!
Jesus reigns, and all is well!

Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We sing hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
