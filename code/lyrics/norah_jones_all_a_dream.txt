Song:

And we finally awake
And walkin' to the sunny day
I can see it in your face
That everything will be okay
'Cause you never hurt

Someone who wants to learn
To be your slave

And the night is also clear

The clouds will never reappear

But the moon is out of place

And all the trees are lookin' strange

And feelin' no warmth

Of your breath against my skin

Now I hope this isn't only just a dream

So we run into a church

The people all look the same

And the sun is in my eyes

I'm tryin' hard to scream your name

My stomach starts to churn

And the curtains in the wind begin to burn

And now I know it's all a dream

Enemy sleeps with me night or day

Enemy teases every minute in my mind

He's in my mind

Enemy throws all my money away

Enemy knows how to make me always pay

I always pay

Enemy lies on cross my mind

Enemy talks, talking it's so nice and kind

So nice and kind
And how long does it take

To fight off this weakness

And tell him to guard me

'Cause god knows I'm sorry

Mmmm... 

Oooo...
