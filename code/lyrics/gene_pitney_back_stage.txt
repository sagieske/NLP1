Song:

A thousand hands applaud tonight
I sing my songs my star shines bright
I stop and smile I take my bow
I leave the stage and then somehow

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry
You've gone away and each night I seem to die a little

Out on that stage I play the star
I'm famous now I've come so far
A famous fool I let love go
I didn't know I'd miss you so

Backstage I'm lonely, backstage I cry
Hating myself since I let you say goodbye

Every night a different room
Every night a different club
And yet I'm lonely all the time
When I sign my autograph
When I hold an interview
Can't get you out of my mind

Come back my love come back to me
I need you now so desperately
What good is fame it's just a game
I'd give it all to be the same

Backstage I wait now, hoping I'll see
Your smiling face waiting there backstage for me
Your smiling face waiting backstage for me
Backstage
Backstage
