Song:

How can I say thanks for the things
You have done for me?
Things so undeserved yet you gave
To prove your love for me
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude
All that I am, and ever hope to be
I owe it all to thee

To god be the glory, to god be the glory
To god be the glory for the things he has done
With his blood he has saved me
With his power he has raised me
To god be the glory for the things he has done
Just let me live my life and
Let it be pleasing lord to thee
And if I gain any praise, let it go to calvary
With his blood he has saved me
With his power he has rasied me
To god be the glory for the things he has done
