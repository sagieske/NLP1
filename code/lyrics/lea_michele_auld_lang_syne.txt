Song:

Should old acquaintance be forgot 
And never brought to mind 
Should all acquaintance be forgot 
And auld lang syne 

For auld lang syne, my dear, 
For auld lang syne, 
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne 

And surely you will buy your cup 
And surely I'll buy mine 
And we'll take a cup o'kindness yet 
For auld lang syne

We too have run around the slopes 
And picked the daisies fine 
We've londoned many weary foot 
Since auld lang syne 

For auld lang syne, my dear, 
For auld lang syne, 
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne 

We too have paddled in the stream 
From morning sun to night 
But the seas between us broad have roared 
From auld lang syne 

For auld lang syne, my dear, 
For auld lang syne, 
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet, 
For auld lang syne 
We'll take a cup o'kindness yet 
For auld langs syne
