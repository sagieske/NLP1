Song:

I can smell the way you taste
I chase every breath you take
And I'll wait

Why would I deny?
I don't have to lie
Was there something that I missed?
Well it's not this

All you say is that I'm playing games
But if I stay, I'll just go crazy
Throw away the promise that you made
And understand

I just want to touch you
I just want to f**k you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

You move how I want you to
You prove I belong to you
And I do

Why would I deny?
I don't have to lie
Was there something that I missed?
Well it's not this

All you say is that I'm playing games
But if I say, I'll just go crazy
Throw away the promise that you made
And understand

I just want to touch you
I just want to f**k you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

But this is not how I feel
And there is nothing for real
Though I don't know you
I don't even care

But this is not how I feel
And there is nothing for real
Though I don't know you
I don't even care

But this is not how I feel
And there is nothing for real
Though I don't know you
I don't even care

I just want to touch you
I just want to f**k you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I'm in love with you

Can I lie to you?
Like you want me to
I'll say that I love you
