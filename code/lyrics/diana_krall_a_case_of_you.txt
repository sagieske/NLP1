Song:

Just before our love got lost you said
I am as constant as the northern star
And I said, constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue tv screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And still be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me
Love is touching souls
Surely you touched mine
Part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you,
I could drink a case of you, darling
And still be on my feet
And still be on my feet

I met a woman she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, go to him
Stay with him if you care
But be prepared to bleed

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And still be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet
