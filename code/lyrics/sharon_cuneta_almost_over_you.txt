Song:

I saw an old friend of ours today
She asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you've been makin' your rounds round here
While I've been trying to make tears disappear

Now I'm almost over you
I almost should feel blue
So when you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

You're such a sly one
With your cold, cold heart
Maybe leavin' came easy
But it tore me apart
Time heals all wounds they say
And I should know
'Cause it seems like forever
But I'm letting you go

Now I'm almost over you
I almost should feel blue
So when you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you

I can't forgive you and soon I'll forget
All my sheltered dreams
Now that you've left me with nothing to show
All but misery

Now I'm almost over you
I almost should feel blue
When you come back around
After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
