Song:

You're a mystery to me
You make your own reality
And I wonder who you are beneath your skin
Guess I'll never know for sure
But I was safe behind my door
Can't think how I let you talk your way back in
Should have known better then
But I know better now

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I aint gonna cry again

You think I need you but I don't
You think I'll break down but I won't
You've had everything you're gonna get from me
Saw your pleasure in my pain
And it released me from my chains
And I woke up to my own insanity
Waiting for changes that were
Never gonna come

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I aint gonna cry again
I ain't gonna cry again

Now that I see you're twisted
I don't know how I missed it before
Maybe that's what drew me to you
But this is now and that was then
You'll never make me cry again

Should have known better then
But I know better now

You can't hurt me anymore
I'm not the fool I was before
I ain't gonna cry again
I don't believe the lies you tell
So take your heart and go to hell
Cause I aint gonna cry again
