Song:

Ain't got nothing on me
Anymore, they got
Nothing on you
I don't care what they
Say anymore, all I
Want is the truth

I don't feel
To unveil,
Here's a song,
Sing along

Ain't got nothing from me
Anymore, I got
Nothing on you
I don't care what they
Say anymore, all I
Want is the truth

I don't feel
To unveil,
Here's a song,
Sing along
Watch my style,
Pick a place,
Wipe the smile
From your face

I don't feel
To unveil,
Here's a song,
Sing along
Watch my style,
Pick a place,
Wipe the smile
From your face

Hey-e-ey Yeah-e-ey!

Ain't got nothing on me
Anymore, they got
Nothing on you
I don't care what they
Say anymore, all I
Want is the truth
