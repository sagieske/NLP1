Chorus:

Don't wait up for my call no more
Don't expect me to walk through that door
Cause I'm not gonna call no more
So I hope your in love with that nigga
Cause Baby it's over, over (3x)

Verse 1:

Ain't no use in tellin' lies
I already seen his car pullin' out of you driveway
And I won't struggle with goodbyes doin' 175 speedin out on the highway
And I can't hate on a player, I guess the game got ran on me
I guess it's like elevators, sooner or later your coming out...

(Chorus)

Verse 2:

You can keep your Alibis, just from lookin in your eyes I know what u been doin'
And I might say I'm surprised but I got to much pride to be here going through it
Trippin' over bullshit never got me no where (it) never got me no where, but no where running in places
And I won't be immature by acting like I don't care
But umma lick my wounds and just move on so...

(Chorus)

You broke my trust time in time again
I got the last (oh) I got the last laugh, laugh in the end (oh)

(Chorus)
