Song:

Well, here we are
It's kind of nice, we're like this
Very special treat though, I like that

Between you baby and me, love
I can't believe this feelin'
You're so sweet honey, delicious
All our world is true, true

You're so nice, a lot of talent, I like it
Smooth and serious and I can be persuaded
I truly, truly, truly adore you, how I adore you
Take me in a precious way, precious way

You and me baby, between us, just between us
Make all the stars glow from our eyes
All the treasured pleasure emotions, love's emotions
Nothing to lose but a try, try

A try, oh baby
It's like dancing when romancing with you love, oh baby
We get down, get down and move all around

Swaying, swaying, laying, embrace me
Embrace me, please embrace me
We two just getting down
Get down for me, baby

You and me baby, between us, just between us
Make all the stars glow from our eyes
All the treasured pleasure, emotions, love's sweet emotions
There's nothing to lose but a try, try me, baby

Try me, between you baby and me, love
Between you and me, I can't believe if this feelin'
I want you to believe it
You're so sweet, sweet honey, delicious
Baby, and all our world is true, it's so true

All our world is true
Yes indeed, it's really me and you
Me and you little mama
Dancing, romancing

Get down for me baby, baby
Just embrace me, embrace me one more time
You know I want to, baby, ooh sweet embrace
You know I need to, baby, oh, my love

All our world is true, it's true
