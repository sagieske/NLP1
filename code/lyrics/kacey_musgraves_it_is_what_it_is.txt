Song:

I think were thinking to hard,
To put on your shoes and get in your car,
Put it in drive and point it this way,
We don't have to talk,
You don't have to stay,

But I aint got no one sleepin with me,
And you aint got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it aint,
Anymore

We've tried being apart,
But the truth is,
We are who we are,
Were so much alike,
It aint a good thing,
Too dumb to give up,
Too stubborn to change

But I aint got no one sleepin with me,
And you aint got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it aint,
Anymore

Till something better comes along,
Till what ever we have is gone

But I aint got no one sleepin with me,
And you aint got no where that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
Till it aint,
Anymore
Yea it is what it is,
Till it aint,
Anymore
