Song:

You and me we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus:]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable 
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus:]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus:2x]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
And I know...
I know I'm not the only one
