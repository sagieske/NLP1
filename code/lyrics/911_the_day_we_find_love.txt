Song:

Isn't the first time
Won't be the last time

Don't you worry, I don't mean to make you sad
My tears will soon be over
With your conscience clear for a new life ahead
Don't be sorry, I really need to hear the truth
But the only thing I'm asking, cause I need you to
Remember me, as the only one who set you free
Maybe time alone will make you see
How deep our love could be
No, it's never too late

[Chorus:]
Cause I know, this isn't the first time
It won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause you're always, keepin' me waitin', anticipatin'
The day we find love once again

I won't give up while there's a glimmer of a chance
A dream that's never ending
Inviting love and a perfect romance
A burning passion, oh baby you're my destiny
But the message I'm receivein', is your through with me
But I'll be there, even though you tell me you don't care
How could you forget the times we've shared
Don't throw our love away, you know it's never too late

[Chorus:]
Cause I know, this isn't the first time
It won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause you're always, keepin' me waitin', anticipatin'
The day we find love once again

Remember me, as the only one who set you free
Maybe time alone will make you see
How deep our love could be
No, it's never too late

[Chorus:]
Cause I know, this isn't the first time
It won't be the last time
I surrender my soul
Cause you're always, keepin' me waitin', anticipatin'
The day we find love once again
This isn't the first time (The day we find love)
It won't be the last time (And I need you one more time)
Keepin' me waitin', anticipatin' (The day we find love)
This isn't the first time (The day we find love)
It won't be the last time (The day we find love)
