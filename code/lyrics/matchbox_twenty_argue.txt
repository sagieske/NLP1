Song:

She don't, but she will
He says anything to keep her by him
She takes, what she gets, and she never did flinch

So over, and over, anyone
With any mind would think that's all she gets
[Chorus:]
If you want you can get to know me well
We get along so we shouldn't argue
And I don't know, said I don't know
All these feelings, cloud up my reasoning
Cloud up my reasoning

I know, but I still
Believe in ignorance as my best defense
So go on, wreck me
Funny how I carry on, and not be taken over
Will not roll over on anyone,
Cuz anyone would stand up on my side
[Chorus:]
You know it's funny how sometimes,
It don't work out like you want to
No you never get nothing at all
Then she tells you that it's over, boy don't you hate it
When it's over
I guess something just got lost, and it
Deeply saddens me
So over, and over anyone, whos anyone
[Chorus:]
