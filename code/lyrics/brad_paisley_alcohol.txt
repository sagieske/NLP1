Song:

Verse 1:
I can make anybody pretty.
I can make you believe any lie.
I can make you pick a fight with somebody, twice your size.....

I've been known to cause a few break-ups.
I've been known to cause a few births.
I can make you new friends, or get you fired from work.

Chorus:
And since the day I left Milwaukee.
Lynchburg, Bordeaux France,
Been making the bars, lots of big money.
And helping white people dance.
I got you in trouble in high-school.
College now that was a ball.
Had some of the best times, you'll never remember with me...
Alcohol, Alcohol

Verse 2:
I got blamed at your wedding reception, for the best mans embarrassing speech.
Also for those naked pictures of you, at the beach.
I've influenced kings and world leaders.
Helped Hemmingway write like he did.
And I'll bet you a drink or two, I can make you put that lampshade on your head.......................

Chorus:
'cause since the day I left Milwaukee.
Lyncheburg, Bordeaux France,
Been making a fool out of folks just like you.
And helping white people dance.
I am medicine and I am poison.
I can help you up or make you fall..
Had some of the best times, you'll never remember with me...
Alcohol, Alcohol

Chorus:
'cause since the day I left Milwaukee.
Lynchburg, Bordeaux France,
Been making the bars, lots of big money.
And helping white people dance!!!
Yea, I got you in trouble in High-School.
College now that was a ball.
Had some of the best times, you'll never rememeber with me Alcohol, alcohol
