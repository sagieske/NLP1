Song:

If I could only make a wish
That would last forever
I'd wish that we belong together
And if I close my eyes in prayer
And wait for an answer
I hope it'd be you standing there

But I could only dream
Of holding you one more time
And I could only whisper
Silent wishes longing for your love again
That's all I do to have one chance with you

If I could only be the one
You're holding in your arms
I'd love to feel the same way
She feels tonight
And if there's only one thing in the world
I truly loved
Is when I had one chance with you

But I could only dream
Of holding you one more time
And I could only whisper
Silent wishes longing for your love again
That's all I do to have one chance with you

But I could only dream
Of holding you one more time
And I could only whisper
Silent wishes longing for your love again
That's all I do to have one chance with you

But I could only dream
Of holding you one more time
And I could only whisper
Silent wishes longing for your love again
That's all I do to have one chance with you
