Song:

Hey there, Bret
I see you looking down
Don't want to see my little buddy there with a frown
Just because I get more women than you
Well, that's only because they don't know you like I do.

Sure, you're weedy and kinda shy
But some girlie out there must be needy for a weedy, shy guy.
They want you as they needle when they're rolling in the hay.
Just hear me out when I say,

Bret, you got it goin' on
The ladies get to know your sexuality
When they get to know your personality.
I said, Bret, you got it goin' on.
Not in a g** way
Just in a hey, mate,
I want to say that you're looking okay, mate.

Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy
That he thinks his booty is fly?
Not all the time, obviously
Just when he's got a problem with his self esteem
Don't let anybody tell you you're not humpable
Because you're bumpable
Well, I hope this doesn't make you feel uncomfortable
If I say you've got a boom-ow-ow
Come on, Bret
Help me out now

Bret you got it goin' on.
(I got it goin' on)

That's the conclusion that I've come to
But that doesn't mean that I want to bum you.
Bret, you've got it goin' on
(Got it goin' on)

No doubt about it
We'd be getting crazy
If one of us was lucky enough to be born a lady.

Oooh, if one of us was a lady
And I was your man, if I was your man
Well, sometimes it gets lonely
And I need a woman
And then I imagine you with some bosoms
In fact, one time when we were touring
And I was really lonely
And we were sharing that twin room in the hotel
I put a wig on you when you were sleeping
Put a wig on you
Ooh ooh ooh
And I just laid there and spooned you
Bret, you've got it goin' on
