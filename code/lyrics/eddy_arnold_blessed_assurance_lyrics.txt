Song:

(Fanny J. Crosby - J.F. Knapp)

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine
Air of salvation, purchase of God
Born of his spirit, washed in his blood.

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submition, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my side
Angels descending bring from above
Echos of mercy, whispers of love.

This is my story this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

This is my story this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Saviour all the day long...
