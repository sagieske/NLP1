Song:

Ooh, don't talk to me!

Well, you tell me I'm the one then you tell me not to come, oh yeah
Way you call me names way you play those games, oh yeah

Do you believe it? Do you believe it?
Could it be another man? Well, I just don't understand
Baby, you're so strange

She got high healed shoes, she got rhythm and blues, oh yeah
She got her red dress on 'n' her legs are long, oh yeah

Do you believe it? Do you believe it?
Could it be another man? Well, I just don't understand
Baby, you're so strange, ooh, yes you are

Baby, so strange... So strange...
Baby, you're so strange (Bop, bop, bop, bop... Ooo)
You're so strange (Bop, bop, bop, bop... Ooo)
Mmm, you're so strange (So, so, so, so... Ooo strange)
Mmm, you're so strange, you're so strange (Bop, bop, bop, bop... Ooo)
You're so strange (Bop, bop, bop, bop... Ooo)
You're so strange (So, so, so, so... Ooo strange)
Ah babe you're so strange, ooh

Do (ooh) you believe it? (ooh) Do (ooh) you believe it? (ooh)
Could you be another man? Well, I just don't understand
Baby, you're so strange

Baby, so strange... Yoo-hoo, so strange...
