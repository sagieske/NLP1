Song:

Here we are
Spinning in circles again
We are
Young enough to think that we can

But nobody is to blame
Funny how things don't change at all
But I keep thinking
Maybe we'll be good someday

And we'll find another window
With a different point of view
And we'll wake up here tomorrow
Expecting something new
What are we thinking?
Are we really thinking it through?
Is this just another chapter
In the book of me and you?
Yeah, the book of me and you.

I turn the page
Thinking I can turn this around
The page
Every wall that's up must come down
Funny how it never does
Trying to make it like it was won't work
But I keep thinking time will
Make us strong enough

And we'll find another window
With a different point of view
And we'll wake up here tomorrow
Expecting something new
What are we thinking?
Are we really thinking it through?
Is this just another chapter
In the book of me and you?

I keep on looking back and
Every place I go, seems you were there
It makes me laugh that we're still
Crashing into nothing and I swear
We always wind up where we started

Here we are

And we'll find another window
With a different point of view
And we'll wake up here tomorrow
Expecting something new
What are we thinking?
Are we really thinking it through?
Is this just another chapter
In the book of me and you?
In the book of me and you
In the book of me and you
It's the book of me and you
