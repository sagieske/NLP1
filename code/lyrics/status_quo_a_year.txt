Song:

(Lancaster / Frost)

Standing by the wayside, begging for a ride
I been waiting so long, a year has gone
Look at all the people, strangers every one
I've been looking so long, a year has gone

You were all I lived for, I guess my life is through
I've been living so long, I can't go on
Lonely Sunday morning, rest in peace, my love
You been sleeping so long, a year has gone

How could I ever start to tell you
The end is almost here?
The song of love is ringing in my ears
Playing loud, playing clear
The song will never change
The memory will always be so near

Standing by the wayside, begging for a ride
I been waiting so long, a year has gone
