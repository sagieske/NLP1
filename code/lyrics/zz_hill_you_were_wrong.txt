Song:

Hey, you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong, girl
You were wrong

You were wrong, little girl
Stayed away too long

Hey, said that ain't right
Stay out at night
It ain't right
To fuss and fight

You were wrong, little girl
Stayed away too long

I said I tried
And I tried and I tried
To do the thing what's right

Seemed like the harder I tried, little girl
All you wanna do is fight

Hey, you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong, girl
You were wrong

You were wrong, little girl
Stayed away too long, hey

I said I asked myself
And I asked myself
I asked myself again
Said how can I do the thing what's right
When I keep on living in sin

Hey, you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong, girl
You were wrong

You were wrong, little girl
Stayed away too long

Hey, you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong, girl
You were wrong

You were wrong, little girl
Been away too long
Hey, you were wrong
