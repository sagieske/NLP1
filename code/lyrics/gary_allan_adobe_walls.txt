Song:

Buenos noches senorita, I'm mighty pleased to meet ya
Maybe you and I could sit a spell and talk
I'm new to Santa Fe, I just rode into town today
Thought I'd spend some time in these adobe walls
It's dark in this cantina, it's a wonder that I seen ya
Sittin' without any company at all
I was wondering if we might dance away this lonely night
Like two shadows on these old adobe walls

I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know

These walls have stood for ages and though time still turns it's pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
Sure as there are stars above we're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls

I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
As I take you in my arms and hold you close
Though I don't understand a word you're saying
Your brown eyes tell me all I need to know

These walls have stood for ages
And though time still turns it's pages
Hearts are still the same when night begins to fall
As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls

As sure as there are stars above
We're not the first to fall in love
That's the magic of these old adobe walls
