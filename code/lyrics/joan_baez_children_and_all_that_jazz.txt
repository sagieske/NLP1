Sweet Pearl and Nicholas
Come here and tickle us
I don't like nicknames
I like to play games
One of them's Batman
That's where it's at man
Look at your t-shirt
I see you're all wet now
I'll give you a bath
If you'll go to bed now
Oh can't you see
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired

Joey and Janet

Kimmie and David
Who shall we play with?
Here comes my own son
Light of my life is
Younger than new leaves
Brighter than you please
Says that he loves me
Big as the world
And Gabriel Harris
You go to bed now
You go to bed now
It's quarter to nine
I'm tired
I'm tired
I'm tired

You heard what I said now
You go to bed now
It was a hard day
Never enough play
Iggy was sick
And couldn't come over
One of your mice died
That was when you cried
Get in the tub
And play with your boats now
Sit here beside me
I'll tell you a story
One about snakes
And anything gory
Ask me no questions
How far is the sky
And I'm falling asleep
And you're smarter than I am
Light of my life
Good night
Good night
Good night
