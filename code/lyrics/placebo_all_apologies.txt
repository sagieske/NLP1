Song:

What else should I be? All apologies
What else should I say? Everyone is g**
What else should I write? I don't have the right
What else should I be? All apologies

In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun I'm married
Buried

I wish I was like you, easily amused
Find my nest of salt, everything's my fault
I'll take all the blame, aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn with freezerburn, choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun, in the sun I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun I'm married
Buried
Married
Buried

All in all is all we are
