Song:

Has nobody asked you how you are?
You look like you might not last the day
I wouldn't have made it very far
So we'd make a good team right away
I've not made amends for yesterday
My lip won't get me out of it
Waking up dreading hearing tales
Of all my nightmares being true
I take a breath and grab the phone
Secretly hoping you're not home
I'd leave a message - I was out
Out of my mind on drink and drugs
