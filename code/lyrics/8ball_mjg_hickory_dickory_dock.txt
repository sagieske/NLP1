Song:

Hickory dickory dock (dock)
Hickory dickory dock (dock), your girl pulled out my cock (my cock)

[Chorus]
Here a girl, there a girl
Errwhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (dock), your girl pulled out my cock (my cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

[Verse - 8 Ball]
Patrone, double shots, wit no chase
Sticky green, fire it up and blow it in yo face
We deep, 50 deep, so don't hate
Forever never slippin naw pimpin we straight
What it do, the bets back, the checks fat, the track tight
We funna cook a fresh batch
Money maker, you makin money, then show me some
Dime pieces, bend it over let me see ya thong
Shades on, blacka bodies I'm in my zone
Trunk kickin like it know karate
We sittin tall, big ball, and MJ pushin to the limit
I'm reppin for tennesy so I gotta keep it pimpin now

[Chorus]
Here a girl, there a girl
Errwhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (dock), your girl pulled out my cock (my cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

[Verse - MJG]
They call me (inauduble) MJG you know I party hard
Most a yall pussy cat niggas (inaudible)
Any time you wanna load up you know I'm ready (I'm ready)
Rich ass niggas can't ride in my Chevy (my Chevy)
You don't wanna hear me speak, you just wanna see my rims
Spinnin underneath my vehicle like a like a roll of film
I don't even need tint, they already know its me
If I add tint, when I get out they'll know its me
Hennesy, grey goose, good purp, and patrone
Gotta keep a lot of it, so I can stay in the zone
Everytime I'm in the hood, everytime I'm in the club
Look kids, grown folks, old folks show me love

[Chorus]
Here a girl, there a girl
Errwhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (dock), your girl pulled out my cock (my cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week

[Verse - 8 Ball]
Wheels spinnin, the kush burning
The beat knockin, I know the pill kickin in go on get it poppin
Don't be scared, we rock stars, we party hard, valley park 20 cars
Then go and buy the bar
Bleed, we keep it gritty, we keep it gutta
Bangas worldwide I'm ya neighborhood cooch cutta
[MJG]
Yeah, spray it on some cooch butta
Some call it K Y
Say my mutha fuckin name girl, say my name
(inaudible) MJG, millions we runnin through pimp daily
You can crawl at the bottom, til ya make ya knees hurt
Or do it like I do it, make the block bleed work

[Chorus x2]
Here a girl, there a girl
Errwhere I go a girl
Blow dro wit the girl, I don't even know the girl
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
Hickory dickory dock (dock), your girl pulled out my cock (my cock)
All day, every day, 365, 7 days a week
