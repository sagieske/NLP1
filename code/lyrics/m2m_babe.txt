Song:

YEH...BaBe...Ohhh Yehh..
Lets go out together,
to check out the world,
to look at all the things,
you wonder about me.

what'd you do without me?
will you still think of me?
would you still care about me?
after all the things i did,
after all the words i said,

Its so impossible,
how you just change,
It doesnt even take a day,
your heart just swifts away.

N yeh i love you more each day,
could i be there for you,
to share the thoughts thats in your mind,

whats the point of us?
i dont want to do this anymore,
it just makes us all sad,
its so stuck in my head.

would you care for me?
or would you die for me?
or would you just say goodbye?

and leave me all by myself...
