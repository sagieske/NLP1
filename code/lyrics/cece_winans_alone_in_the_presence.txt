Song:

Verse:
I'm Safe and Sound, serene and calm.
Whenever I'm here, I know you're near me.
My secret place where I escape, from all the cares of this race, because of your grace.

Chorus:
Joy fills my heart,
Peace rules and reigns there.
Nothing but love overflows and your will clearly shown.
When I'm alone in the presence of you.

Verse:
Wisdom is served and life preserved.
All from your words that you speak, lord.
Power displayed and weakness fades.
Your greatness is known and all fears erased, because of your grace.
(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
When I'm alone with you,
My soul learns worship.
In Spirit and in truth,
For the glory of your name..
(Repeat Chorus)
I love it when I'm alone in the presence of you,
I'm happy when I'm alone in the presence of you,
When I'm alone in the presence of you.
