Song:

Lover, I just can't believe it's turned
You're tearing my life apart
There's no simple answer
Here I am, just standing in circles
And the logic is turning me round
My mind keeps holding
Only one thought
When you gonna call
I think it's worth the time
How you gonna change
All these endless nights
If you could stop
Leading me around
You're never gonna change
All these endless nights
Tender, the way
That you touched me now
We were taking our fears away
There won't be no reason
Just a well rehearsed explanation
Though the love
That is turning inside
Keeps on twisting
Twisting my mind
When you gonna call
I think it's worth the time
How you gonna change
All these endless nights
If you could stop
Leading me around
You're never gonna change
All these endless, endless nights
I wish that you could change
All these endless, endless nights
And the hope
That is holding me here
It's starting to die, oh, no
Is it ever gonna stop
When you gonna call
I think it's worth the time
How you gonna change
All these endless nights
If you could stop
Leading me around
You're never gonna change
All these endless, endless nights
I wish that you could change
All these endless, endless nights
All these endless
Endless nights now
When you gonna call
I think it's worth the time
I wish that you would call now
When you gonna change
All these endless, endless nights
