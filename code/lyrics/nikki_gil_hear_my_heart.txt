Song:

Here I am
Talking to myself again
Trying to figure out
What I've been doing wrong

Let me know
Where all of my love should go
Why all the hurt and the pain and the tears
I can't show

Trying so hard to walk away
But baby this I have to say

Hear my heart
Crying in silence
It hurts so much
Trying to run from your smile, your touch
Waiting, pretending this game's a waste
Knowing you just can't be mine

Let me know
Where all of my love should go
Why all the hurt and the pain and the tears
I can't show

Trying so hard to walk away
But baby this I have to say

Hear my heart
Crying in silence
It hurts so much
Trying to run from your smile, your touch
Waiting, pretending this game's a waste
Knowing you just can't be mine

Hear my heart
Crying in silence
It hurts so much
Trying to run from your smile, your touch
Waiting, pretending this game's a waste
Knowing you just can't be mine

If you could only look my way
If you could only listen to what I have to say

Hear my heart
Crying in silence
It hurts so much
Trying to run from your smile, your touch
Waiting, pretending this game's a waste
Knowing you just can't be mine

Hear my heart
Crying in silence
It hurts so much
Trying to run from your smile, your touch
Waiting, pretending this game's a waste
Knowing you just can't be mine

Praying someday you'd be mine
