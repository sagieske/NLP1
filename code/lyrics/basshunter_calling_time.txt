Song:

Calling time
Calling your time on me, me
Can’t you see
Things ain’t workin’ out for you, and me

Calling time
Calling your time on me, me
Can’t you see
Things ain’t workin’ out for you
Calling time
You know you want it called tonight
You know you’re mine
Just let go and no more lies

Calling time
You know you want it called tonight
You know you’re mine
Just let go and no more lies

(Instrumental)

I’m calling time
I’m calling time
Now ’cause we’re at the end of the line

I’m calling time
Calling your time on me, me
Can’t you see
Things ain’t workin’ out for you, and me

Calling time
You know you want it called tonight
You know you’re mine
Just let go and no more lies

Calling time
You know you want it called tonight
You know you’re mine
Just let go and no more lies

Calling time
You know you want it called tonight
You know you’re mine
Just let go and no more lies
