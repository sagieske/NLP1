Song:

Open your eyes wide to those things being abused
Never mind those strangers, those acting fools
I like the way you walk, the way you talk
The smile on your face that makes it all wrong
Does anybody know who I am
On the other hand, don't give a damn
Do the same thing, never again, do the same thing
Why do you have to lie

Everyday I get burned
F**k, don't leave me broken
Tired of you, so tired of you
You're my friend, die

Give me a reason why I can't be myself
You said, I should be somebody else
Try not to think, just try not to think
Does anybody know who I am
On the other hand, don't give a damn
Do the same thing, never again, do the same thing

Everyday, everyday, I get burned
F**k, don't leave me broken
Tired of you
You're my friend, my only friend
Die

Cause I'm you

Tired of you
You're my friend, my only friend
Die
