Song:

Whoa whoa whoa
I know you hate it
When i say these things right in your face
But I can't lie
You know me better
It's cause the words inside just speak the truth

One look
And I'm mesmerized by your eyes
You're comin' like a hurricane
Blowing down on me

Cause it's your mystery that captures me
I'm falling in, drawing closer
And now, oh now, yeah

Pardon me
I'm being honest
Cause I don't hide, I speak my mind
Things get weird
But we know better
It's cause I know you know that I love you girl

One look
And I'm mesmerized by your eyes
You're comin' like a hurricane
Blowing down on me

Cause it's your mystery that captures me
I'm falling in, drawing closer
And now, oh now, yeah

Blowing down on me

One look
And I'm mesmerized by your eyes
You're comin' like a hurricane
Blowing down on me

Cause it's your mystery that captures me
I'm falling in, drawing closer
And now, oh now, yeah
