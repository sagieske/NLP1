Song:

The sound of the earthquake,
The rhythms that you make,
Are makin' my head shake in two.

Magnitized by you
Your love will pull me through
You pull through earth and stone,
You pull through flesh and bones

The sounds of the earthquake
The movements that you make
Are shakin' my head right in two

You know I was never leaving
In each other, we're believin'
Lust will never catch us grieving
Along the way we command it to stay

Everytime our fate is taken
All around the ground is breakin'
We're safe!
It's the love we're makin'
It won't fly apart from the beat of our heart

Like the ground and the sound of the earthquake,
And the rhythms that you make,
You're makin' it shakes my head in two

Rivers, waves they burst and pull
The pilot's ways beneath our oars
Canyons, mountain we just swore
We keep our cool inside heart
Through the massive walls that hit us
All this power will never quit us
No result can ever split us in two

The sound of the earthquake,
The exchanges that we make,
Are takin' my head right in two

The sounds!
You know I was never leaving
In each other, we're believin'
Lust will never catch us grieving
Along the way we command it to stay.

Everytime our fate is taken
All around the ground is breakin'
We're safe! In the love we're makin'
It won't fly apart from the beat of our heart

Like the ground and the sound of the earthquake,
And the rhythms that you make,
You're makin' it shakes my head in two

Magnitized by you
Your love will pull me through
You pull through earth and stone,
You pull through flesh and bones

The sounds of the earthquake
And the rhythms that you make,
Are shakin' my head right in two
Right in two

The sounds of...
Yeah!
