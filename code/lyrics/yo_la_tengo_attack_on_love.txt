Song:

'There is a group of young Chinese who love music as their manner of
Expression. They find love in adversity and dedication. They represent
Dramatic, living love.'

Let's go change, you hokey little runt who wanted to dance, maybe fifteen
Years old, maybe sixteen years old, she says, "Hey man, you all suck!" So I
Get on up there, put her on her little ass with my honky stuff, with this
Attack on love. A little later on, it don't matter when, I get up back on
The dance floor again. I say, "Hey, baby, what's your name? What's your
Name? What bothers you today? Are you ready for a little something to do?"
