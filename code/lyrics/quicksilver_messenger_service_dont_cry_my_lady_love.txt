Song:

Don't cry, my sweet love, you know how I can't stand you crying.
All right, my lady love, I know how hard you been trying.
Some day in the morning, when the sunshine won't shine in your window.
You may remember that I was the sun in your window.
But these things happen all the time, they're always the same.
One's always crying, and one's always easing the pain.
You say good bye, my lady love, you don't want the memories to haunt you.
Just look in my eyes, babe, you can change my mind if you want to.
But some day, with someone that you never cared for to start with.
You may remember the one boy you once shared your heart with.
But these things are happening, and never right all the time.
One's always leaving, and one's always changing his mind.

[Instrumental]

Another time, another place, you know that I really love you.
Dry your eyes, my funny face, I never placed another one above you.
Don't you remember the way that you once tried to leave me.
And maybe some day, you may know you really didn't need me.
But these things happen all the time, they're always the same.
One's always crying, and one's always taking the blame.
One's always crying, and one's always taking the blame.
