Song:

If you could come clean about everything,
It would be easy for you to be sorry,
If you could see all the possibilities,
We might not still be standing,
Where we started.

Oh no, Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too,
Maybe we're all that we needed,
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight,
Maybe we're all that we needed.

You could say we were just a big mistake,
But I think it's worth making
Worth repeating.
I would say good things come to those who wait,
I would say anything if you'd believe it.

Oh no,
Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too,
Maybe we're all that we needed,
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight,
Maybe we're all that we needed.
Maybe we're perfect but not meant to be.
Or more alike then we're willing to see.
Maybe we're not meant to not disagree.
Maybe we're crazy, baby.

If you could come clean about everything,
It would be easy for you, to be sorry,
If you could see all the possibilities,

We might not still be standing where we started.
Oh no,
Don't let me go for this,
Don't let me go for this.

I might be a fool, you might be one too,
Maybe we're all that we needed,
Two wrongs don't make a right,
But I don't care tonight,
Maybe we're all that we needed.
I don't care tonight,
Maybe were all that we needed.
I don't care tonight,
Maybe were all that we needed.
