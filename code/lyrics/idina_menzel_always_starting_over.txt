Liz:
In my life I never thought I'd get a second chance
I thought I was done – then I met you
And though I never dreamed I could learn how to love again
I placed my bet
And you came through
I somehow still lost
I somehow always do
This time feels new

Thank you for finding me
And thank you for the care
And f**k you for making me think that this life might be fair
You promised to love me,
A promise you kept
And I won't be sorry that you said to leap and I leapt
I won't regret
What I did then
Though it hurts more than I could imagine back when
All the same, even so
I would love you all over again

Am I always
Starting over?
In a brand new story
Am I always
Back at one
After all I've done?
‘Cause I've burned all of my bridges
And learned ev’ry last lesson too
So how can I start new?

I’ll love our children,
Both fiercely and well
When they ask about you,
Oh lordly, the stories I’ll tell
And I won't regret the lives I didn't lead
I knew you, I loved you,
And let that be all that I nedd
So that it’s fate
Say it’s foretold
I'm through with fighting it
I'm much too old
What the gods have to give
I’ll take, and I’ll live, and be bold

If we’re always
Starting over
Ev’ry brand-new morning
Then we’re always
Starting out
With the end in doubt
We can leave life for tomorrow
Or grieve all that we thought we’d do
Or make each moment new

All that has happened is happening now
All that might happen is here, somehow
All of the choices that made me, me
All of the accidents yet to be
All that's ahead
And all that's behind
It’s all in the moment
I make up my mind
And open my heart
And start
And start

‘Cause we’re always
Starting over
Ev’ry lofe we’re living
And we’re always
Just awake
Ev’ry step we take
And my love, our life is over
But love, I’ll make you one last vow
To start over
And over
And over somehow
My new life starts right now!
