Song:

You're crying night and day
You wonder how you ever lost your way
Nothing matters, you must survive
You heart is slowly dying and so you cry

[Chorus:]
All that I need is love
From the moment I wake
Let me feel your embrace
All that I need is love
Hold me closer each day, every step of the way

Like flowers need the rain to live
A bright beginning Lord, the greatest gift you give
You changed my, life forever
Lover of my life, I realize

When the morning comes and the sun rises to the sky
All my troubles will be over and the way made easy
Until then all I need is to know You'll always hear me
When I call out Your name, call out Your name

Chorus

Chorus to fade
