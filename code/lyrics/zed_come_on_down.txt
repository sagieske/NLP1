Song:

He's your focus
When the lights not green
You come and go so soon.
You pass him off now
As another friend
But nothing special.
Since I've seen what ya gonna be
I couldn't leave that loaded gun in your hand
Said no, no, no
Said no, no
And I wish
That you would come on down
And get involved.
And I wish
That you stick around
Just come on down.
Face the wall now
Since you messed up again
How did you know so soon?
Don't pass it up now
Because... Change through the day
Your'll looking different already.
Since I've seen what ya gonna be
I couldn't leave that loaded gun in your hand
Said no, no, no
Said no, no
And I wish
That you would come on down
And get involved.
And I wish
That you stick around
Just come on down.
No don't you tell me
What's on your mind
Coz if I hesitate and run
Or leave that gun loaded gun in your hand...
And I wish, I wish, I wish
And I wish
That you would come on down
And get involved.
And I wish
That you stick around
Just come on down yeah come on down
And I wish (since iv'e seen what ya gonna be)
That you would come on down
And get involved.
And I wish (since I've seen what ya gonna be)
That you stick around
And I wish, I wish, I wish
