Song:

Get yourself a crewcut
Your hair's too long
I hear it over and over
And over again

The language you speak
Is way too strong
I hear it over and over
And over again

I bought a brand new guitar
And I'm so proud
I play it over and over
And over again

I can't play good
But I play it loud
Now turn it down, turn it down
Son, you got to turn it down

I hear it over and over
And over again
Everybody's telling me
What I oughta be

A doctor or a lawyer
But I need a degree
That good old rock and roll's
Got a hold on me

[Chorus:]
Why can't everybody see
I just wanna be
A boogie woogie man
Do the best that I can
To make a living
By giving my songs
Yeah, a boogie woogie man
With the boogie woogie dance
Singing boogie woogie
All night long

Now my mama and my daddy
Say that I can't sing
I hear it over and over
And over again

But all the little girls
Like the way I scream
I hear it over and over
And over again

Yeah, everybody's telling me
What I oughta be
A doctor or a lawyer
But I need a degree

That good old rock and roll's
Got a hold on me
Why can't everybody see
I just wanna be

[Chorus:]

I hear it over and over
And over and over again...
