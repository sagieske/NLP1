Song:

[Intro:]
Come closer.
I've got what you need.
I crawl into your veins.
Satisfaction guaranteed.

[Chorus:]
A thousand smiles. A thousand lies.
I'll break you down you'll need more just to stay alive.
A thousand dead. A thousand highs.
Close your eyes and wait to die.
Your life was built on a thousand lies.

[Verse:]
I don't know what you're looking for.
I don't know why you keep on crawling back for more.
Erase and rewind.
Your life is gone.
I can read you like an open book.
I'll steal your life like the lives you took.
I'll set you free from what you've become.

See the needle disappear into your skin.
Shoot it up and wait for the thrill.
Lay your body down and wait for the chill
And I'll whisper you lullaby that will kill.

[Chorus:]
A thousand smiles. A thousand lies.
I'll break you down you'll need more just to stay alive.
A thousand dead. A thousand highs.
Close your eyes and wait to die.
Your life was built on a thousand lies.

[Verse 2:]
Throw away everything you've got
For a rush you cannot stop.
Injecting the will, the will to be free.

See the needle disappear into your skin.
Shoot it up and wait for the thrill.
Lay your body down and wait for the chill
And I'll whisper you lullaby that will kill.
