Song:

As I recall it, the sun was high,
Yellow in the blue, blue sky.
You couldn't quite make out this boy,
He used life as a toy.
In a Marie-Antoinette room
We were introduced soon,
I was me and you were you,
How do you do?
Raggedy and tousle-haired
He looked as though he never cared
To run a comb where a comb should run,
Freckles from the sun.
Many good times we have had,
We been happy, we been sad,
But I think we both feel glad
That this life is so mad, mad, mad.
As I recall it, the sun was high,
If I remember, the sun was high,
You couldn't quite make out this boy,
He used life as a toy.
Many good times we have had,
We been happy, baby, we been sad,
But I think we both feel glad
That this life is so mad.
As I recall it, the sun was high,
Yellow in the blue, blue sky,
You couldn't quite make out this boy,
He used life as a toy.
Yeah!
