Speak
Yo why should we break up?
If we keep making up
I mean let's just stay together

Verse 1
I know, together we make this relationship a little harder at least on ourselves (selves)
We give and we take from each other some much that I feel we don't need no one else (else)
We fuss and we fight then the next day we tight this is crazy girl you need some help (help)

Chorus
Girl if you pull up to my window
Imma take your order (order)
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya (for ya)
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya (spoil ya)
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

So why the hell we break up (up)
If we only make up (up)
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one I want girl (girl)
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up

Verse 2
Ah, we woke with the birds and this is soft spoken words
That would lead you right into my arms
The perfect equation like m x plus y we are probably apart(apart)
The no one on this earth is like missed but is worth it someone that I could do anything for (for)
It seems like your pouring your heart away

Chorus
But if you pull up to my window
Imma take your order (order)
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya (for ya)
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya (spoil ya)
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

So why the hell we break up (up)
If we only make up (up)
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one I want girl (girl)
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up

Verse 3
In the middle of the night I be wondering why
Why you ain't right here
Many days that go by and I ain't gon lie I neeed you right here
My baby but after all call me crazy, but your like a drug
Summer kiss daily and we get back in love
Cupid in the sky cause girl you I-I-I love you
And I know sometimes we struggle you are the piece to the puzzle
Come here take a ride
Someone to...

Chorus
Pull up to my window
Imma take your order (Imma take your order)
Anything you want girl you know I'll get it for ya (You now I'll get it for ya)
Say you wanna be my baby, you know I gotta spoil ya (You know I gotta spoil ya)
For the rest of my life I'm ready to enjoy us

So why the hell we break up (Why oh why, why)
If we only make up (If we only make up)
I ain't gonna stop now I gotta front you the only one I want girl (I ain't gonna stop)
So why the hell we break up
If we only make up
