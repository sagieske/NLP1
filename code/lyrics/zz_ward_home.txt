Song:

I don't need another taste of your lips, 
To know I'm home when we're lying here like this, 
The world could end today; the sun could just fall, 
Here in this bed we made, we're safe from it all, 

When nobody believes me, I know you will, 
When nobody can reach me, I know you will, 
When nobody can please me, I know you will, 

Whoa, 
You get me, you get me home, 
You get me, you get me home, 
With you, I know I'm home, 

We don't need my father to give his blessing, 
We don't match on paper, but it don't mean a thing, 
When all my walls cave in, you pull me through it, 
When there's a gun at me, you'd take the bullet, 

When nobody believes me, I know you will, 
When nobody can reach me, I know you will, 
When nobody can please me, I know you will, 

Whoa, 
You get me, you get me home, 
You get me, you get me home, 
With you, I know I'm home, 

I'm crazy, I get mean, 
But baby, you adore me, 
Shut it down, I get mine, 
My soldier right by side, 
My fire, you feed it, 
Give it to me when I need it, 
I'm all yours, so take me, 
Good god, this love's amazing, 

When nobody believes me, I know you will, 
When nobody can reach me, I know you will, 
When nobody can please me, I know you will, 

Whoa, 
You get me, you get me home, 
You get me, you get me home, 
You get me, you get me home, 
You get me, you get me home, 
With you, I know I'm home, 
With you, I know I'm home
