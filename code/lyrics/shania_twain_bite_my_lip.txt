Song:

I got a nine to five it seems like it never ends
I got a touchy boss that wants me in his hands, yeah
And no is a word that he doesn't understand

He says baby can you work with me tonight
I know he knows that I can use the overtime, yeah
But I can tell he's gonna hand me another line

I gotta bite my lip
Keep it inside
Gotta bite my lip
Just let it ride
I gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say
Gotta bite my lip
Just walk away

Yeah I run straight home I got a hot date tonight, yeah
I got a chilled champage for dinner by candle light
He's gonna be here soon and everything will be alright

I get a call, Guess who's on the other line
I can't make it tonight, Can we do it another time yeah
Oh the nerve, I'd like to give him a piece of my mind

I gotta bite my lip
Keep it inside
Gotta bite my lip
Just let it ride
I gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say
Gotta bite my lip
Just walk away

I gotta bite my lip
Keep it inside
Gotta bite my lip
Just let it ride
I gotta bite my lip
Watch what I say
Gotta bite my lip
Just walk away
