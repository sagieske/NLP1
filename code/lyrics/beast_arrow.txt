Song:

He's got an eye on you
And a weapon, too
He's got an eye on you
And a weapon, too
He's got an eye on you
He's got a weapon, too
I'd like to warn you
But I've got to warn you
They are watching you
Just like my hands do
He's going to hunt; he's going to trap
You are the target he will pursue
Allow me, allow me
To be your muse, your rest
'Til the end of the day
While they target your chest
They've got an eye on you
They've got their weapons, too
I'd like to arm you
But I can't disarm you
They're going to catch you
Just like the others
They're going to trap; they're going to kill the young lovers
Allow me, allow me
To be your muse, your rest
'Til the end of the day
When they make you confess
He's got his mind on you
And information, too
He's got his mind on you
And information, too
He'd like to harm you
Get his army on you
He gets inside of you
Just like my voodoo
He's going to analyze and criticize your point of view
So tell me you, tell me
Which part of war is best?
I heard you say
Your heart was pounding in your chest
He's got his mind on you
And information, too
I tried to warn you
But I couldn't get through
They're coming for you
They won't forgive you
They're going to wipe you clean, erase the tattoo
So tell me you, tell me
Which part of war is best?
I heard you say
Your heart was pounding in your chest
I put a spell on you
And shot an arrow, too
