[Bun B:]
Now my candy, is so fresh so clean
I break them boys off when I pull up on the scene
In my candy, with ten coats sprayed tight
And that Northside royal blue is settin off the white
On my candy, sho' ain't the average paint
You go to Ike tryin to buy it he gon't tell ya ya cain't
Have my candy, it's like a one-of-a-kind
And you might have a painted slab but it ain't pretty as mine
Cause my candy, worth mo' than money can buy
Brought it to Funkmaster Flex and seen a grown man cry
For my candy, sittin on nuttin but glass
Stoppin traffic on the freeway, when I fly past
In my candy, got no competition on the street
You can win a Dub car show and still can't compete
With my candy, cause it's the sweetest on the block
And I'm trill, workin the wheel, that's why they all jockin
My candy~!

[Chorus: singer]
Candy, painted, drop top, El Do', riiiide
("Break the boys on the ave cause the slab's so tight")

[Bun B:]
Now my candy, is sittin tall on them Vogues
It's like an alarm clock, wakin up all the hoes
My candy, is wetter than high tide
And it's lookin like I just had a blizzard inside
Of my candy, got mo' wood in it than a forest
One look'll get you hooked like a motherfuckin chorus
My candy, drips an unerasable stain
It's real magic, not like that m**********r David Blaine
My candy, it got the woman on the front
And a Ph. D in showin ni***z how to stunt
My candy, it got the fifth up on the back
And it'll swang through your hood like it don't know how to act
My candy, the 8th wonder of the world
Like floatin downstream when you're starin at the swirls
My candy, ridin real trill, stayin true
And it's a legend in H-Town like dj s***w
My candy

[Chorus: singer]
Just like candy, it's so sweet
Fadin ni***z, on these streets
People watch as I ride by
In my candy, I'm gon' shine

[Bun B:]
Now my candy, is so smooth, so laid
And these boys can't comprehend how the paint got sprayed
My candy, makin people stop drop and stare
Pull out any car you want to but it won't compare
To my candy, it's like a fo' wheel mirage
That's too pretty to park, in a motherfuckin garage
My candy, it's like a part of the fam'
So lose my friends or my ends I wouldn't give a damn
But my candy, is an extension of me
So when you lookin at my car you lookin at Bun B
It's my candy, player, throwed, fly
And you can't f**k with it no matter how hard you try
My candy, the other level of the game
If you ask me again, b***h I'ma tell you the same
It's my candy, yeah n***a mines not yearns
Long as I got syrup to sip, and Swishers to burn
In my candy
