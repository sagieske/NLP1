Song:

What's behind? What's behind?
What's behind? What's behind?

Mother Mary riding on the dashboard
King James sitting by your side
I bet you cut me off so I could see
Your position on pro-life

Cross swinging from your rear view mirror
Steven Curtis on the radio
If you were shouting at me I couldn't hear
So, I'll assume you were praying for my soul

All your bumper sticker theology
Is doing nothing but confusing me

God's good, God is great, no chrome fish could take the place
Of what people see when your faith is on the line
Love's not just what you say, no, love's what you give away
So tell me is there anything behind your chrome fish anyway?

Put your faith in a designer logo
Stick it somewhere in plain view
A good slogan really sells the truth nowadays
Like, 'What would Jesus do? '

Would He solo in the hov lane?
Would He wear religion on His sleeve?
Or would He break the law to save the world?
Yeah, just to get to work ahead of me

Yeah, your bumper sticker theology
Is doing nothing but confusing me

God's good, God is great, no chrome fish could take the place
Of what people see when your faith is on the line
Love's not just what you say, no, love's what you give away
So tell me is there anything behind your chrome fish anyway?

You've got a right to say what you'd like to
Can you back it up? Can you back it up? Yeah
Too lost in [Incomprehensible], it's just graffiti
Unless you back it up, we gotta back it up

All your bumper sticker theology
Is doing nothing but confusing me

God's good, God is great, no chrome fish could take the place
Of what people see when your faith is on the line
Love's not just what you say, no, love's what you give away
So tell me is there anything behind your chrome fish anyway?

What's behind? What's behind?
Your chrome fish anyway
What's behind? What's behind? What's behind?
Chrome fish, chrome fish

What's behind? What's behind?
Your chrome fish anyway
What's behind? What's behind? What's behind?
Chrome fish, chrome fish

What's behind your chrome fish?
Oh, so tell me what's behind?
Chrome fish, chrome fish

I'm not feeling too much here
