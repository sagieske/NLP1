Song:

I am the planet, the monster, anti-martyr
The balance of human, constant firestarter
Pry apart the soul, find the footprints
All of a sudden, touch the button

Crash course in yesterday's after mathematics class
Until the last chapter's mastered
Smile, for the style war's won
Where the wild things are that hide from the sun

I am the toothache buried in your head
The proof you pretended to carry to the end
Barely alive, but nowhere near dead
I'm still standing here instead

More than a fistful of issues
More than a misfit's pistol grip click
My heart ticks
More human than human, more sicker than sick

Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick
Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick

I am the nightmare, right where the soldier
Overstands warfare, caught in the crosshair
The moment when focus becomes more
Than what's noticed by the starving locusts

The burning of the pride, turning of the tide
Searching through the fight
Snuck in with the shadow that broke the castle
Escaped the cell, let hell out of the capsule

I am the hunted that stalks my aggressor
I am neurosis, I am the measurements used
When it's time to choose which tools are proper
For the opportunity to break it loose

When it breaks, it'll all come together now
Armageddon, just a change in the weather now
I am the one, I've come to let the pressure out
More human than human, so you can feel better now

Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick
Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick

More human than human, more human than human
More human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human

Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick
Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick

Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick
Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick

Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
More human than human, more sicker than sick
Yeah, more human than human
More human than human, more human than human
