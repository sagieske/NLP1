Song:

there was a hole
in the middle of the ground
the prettiest hole
that you ever did see
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grass grows all around
and in this hole
there was a tree
the prettiest tree
that you ever did see
and the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grass grows all around
and on this tree
there was a branch
the prettiest branch
that you ever did see
and the branch on the tre
and the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grass grows all around
and on this branch
there was a nest
the prettiest nest
that you ever did see
and the nest on the branch
and the branch on the tree
and the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grrass grows all around
and in this nest
there was an egg
the prettiest egg
that you ever did see
and the egg in the nest
and the nest on the branch
and the branch on the tree
and the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grrass grows all around
and in this egg
there was a bird
the prettiest bird
that you ever did see
and the bird in the egg
and the egg in the nest
and the nest on the branch
and the branch on the tree
and the tree in the hole
and the hole in the ground
and the green grass grows all around all around
and the green grrass grows all around
