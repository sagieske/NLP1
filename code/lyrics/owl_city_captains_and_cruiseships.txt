Song:

I am stuck in L. A.
Through the week and can't get away
And you're alone on the pier
In West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy night, reawake
The stomach ache that I've acquired
From feeling down, things look grim
And I'm so sick of being tired

Apartment lights go dark
And it's depressing but what can I do?
The midnight streets feel dead
When I am so used to driving with you

Brighter lights fill the night and
Bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize

If you're still up when the ships
In the port prepare to set sail
Comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail

Inside my head you're voice is still resounding but what can I do?
Empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you
Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
And think of me
When you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea

Can you still, hear my voice, when I'm outside from over the phone
For what it's worth, darling dear, I wish you were here Cause I feel alone
When you were home we'd sing but since you've left I don't hear anything
Though I feel so sad, I can't believe things are really that bad

Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the brimy sea
When I crash my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris
I'll cut loose leave this mad house all for the atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway, and sail the ocean with you
