(written by Dave Clark)
Any way you want it
You can call me any day - ay, hey, hey
Any way you want it
You can always hear me say - ay, hey, hey
It's alright (x 8)
Any way you want it
It's the way it will be
You don't want money
You don't want a diamond ring - ay, hey, hey
You say you want my lovin' more than any other thing - ay, hey,
Hey
It's alright (x 8)
Any way you want it
It's the way it will be
Any way - any way you want it
That's alright by me
Any way - any way you want it
That's the way it will be
Any way you want it
You can call me any day - ay, hey, hey
Any way you want it
You can always hear me say - ay, hey, hey
It's alright (x 8)
Any way you want it
It's the way it will be
Any way - any way you want it
That's alright by me
Any way - any way you want it
That's the way it will be
Any way you want it
You can call me any day - ay, hey, hey
Any way you want it
You can always hear me say - ay, hey, hey
It's alright (x 8)
Any way you want it
It's the way it will be
That's the way it will be (x 3)
