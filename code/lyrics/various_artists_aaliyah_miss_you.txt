Song:

[Chorus:]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needin you, wantin you
(said I need you)
Wonderin if ur the same and whos been with you
Is ur heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Verse:]
Off to college
Yes you went away
Straight from high school
You up and left me
We were close friends
Also lovers
Did everything
For one another
Now ur gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back... To me
Can you... Hear me (callin)
Hear me... Callin (for you)
For you... Cuz it's

[Chorus:]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needin you, wantin you
Wonderin if ur the same and whos been with you
Is ur heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm sittin here
Thinkin bout you
And the days we used to share
It's drivin me crazy
I don't know what to do
I'm just wonderin if you still care
I don't wanna let you know
That it's killin me
I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby
Come back... To me
Can you... Hear me (callin)
Hear me... Callin (for you)
For you... Cuz it's

[chorus 2x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
What am I gonna do
Said I been needin you, wantin you
Wonderin if ur the same and whos been with you
Is ur heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Bridge:]
I... Can't... Breathe... No... More
Since you went away I
Don't really feel like talkin
Don't wanna hear you don't love me
Baby do you understand me
I can't do a thing without you

[chorus 3x]
It's been too long and I'm lost without you
(tell me what I'm gonna do)
What am I gonna do
Said I been needin you, wantin you
Wonderin if ur the same and whos been with you
Is ur heart still mine
I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you
