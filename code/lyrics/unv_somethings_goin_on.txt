Song:

Lately I've been thinking that you don't feel the same
I don't know what it is all I know is that you changed
'Cause we used to be so tight, never apart
And now it seems your only want to break my heart, oh yeah
And I don't know what I've done to make you feel this way
One minute you call, the next you don't have a thing to see
Until you bring me here, I'm telling you baby

[Chorus:]
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do
Something's going on, the love we used to share is strong
I'm falling out of love with you, and I don't know what to do

Where did I go wrong? What mistake did I make?
Is there someone else? Tell me baby, you found to take my place.
'Cause now you stay out all night, and you don't even call
We barely kiss, we barely hug, we barely touch at all, yeah baby
And I just can't take no more, this is no way to live
Something must happen, something has got to give
I can feel it, I know, I know there's...

[Chorus:]

[Spoken]
Hey Shawn?
What's up, Jay?
You know I was thinking, man, I haven't seen you with
Your girl so long, I mean what's going on?
Why don't you tell me?
(I'm so confused, oh, and I don't know what to do, baby)
You know, Shawn, I know just how you feel because of my girl
(She left me crying baby, she let me down on my knees)
(Down on my knees)
My name is J-Ski? And Steve?
I say, what's up, Ski?
How are you feeling?
(I feel so lonely...)

[Chorus with ad libs]
