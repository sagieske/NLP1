Song:

Look who's back on the program
Hookin' up another fly joint
When I flow on the slow jam
When I shift I kick to go

Like a fat drunk and I light up a fat spliff
Take a wiff
Can you smell that in the air?
When the smoke come out the building from every where

S**t I still get down, so just sit down
When my thoughts stops crawlin'
Time to sit down with yet I go wrong
You got to hit my bong

Later on then I'll be getting high all alone
You got a friend named Mary Jane
And she make me feel stange
Now I've got to call out her name

I Love You Mary Jane
Sugar come by and get me high
I Love You Mary Jane

Can I call Marijuanna if you wanna party
While s**t I'm gonna as soon as she comes out
Round to my neighberhood
Damm and she always smells good

Let me make this understood
Are you experienced
Have you ever been experienced
Not for the life, make you delerious

Why is the room spinnin'
I can't stop now
I've must have been drinkin'
'Cause this ain't pot

That's doing me like this
I feel ill now
I'm calling out to Mary
'Cause I just can't deal

I Love You Mary Jane
Sugar come by and get me high
I Love You Mary Jane

I Love You Mary Jane
Sugar come by
