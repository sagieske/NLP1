Song:

Yeah yeah yeah yeah woah woah woah oh
Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.

I'm screaming,
He's talking over,
I've asked him twice,
Says he don't know her,
I raise a fist,
He grabs my wrist,
Ask for the truth,
And this is what I get,
I only asked him
Who called your cellular?
He said he don't know,
But yeah it was a girl.
And it's killing,
Like nothing of it,
Now I'm tripping,
I'm yelling up in public like,

Ohhhhh
Can you please just be honest?
You tell me some stories but I just don't want to know,
No I just don't believe it,
And all I want to do is keep screaming,
And he's like,

Please calm down
(Baby, baby)
Because you're talking too loud
I'm hollering,
You won't let the truth come out.
So please calm down
Baby, because you're firing too high (too high)
Should I keep the truth inside?
So maybe it was better to lie

Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.

Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.

I walk away,
So he comes after,
I'm running quick,
But he runs faster.

So explanation that I don't need,
He tells me "Baby, can you sit down and breathe?"
Freaking out, hysterical,
Said you shouldn't lie
Would've been better off

So silly me thinking you're a good guy
Maybe now you know not to lie

Ohhhhh
Can you please just be honest?
You tell me some stories but I just don't want to know,
No I just don't believe it,
And all I want to do is keep screaming,
And he's like,

Please calm down
(Baby, baby)
Because you're talking too loud
I'm hollering,
You won't let the truth come out.
So please calm down
Baby, because you're firing too high (too high)
Should I keep the truth inside?
So maybe it was better to lie

Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.

Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.

I thought it would be better if I did you right,
But I guess I should've told you lies,
You're right, you're right,
And now you're standing there telling me,

Please calm down
(Baby, baby)
Because you're talking too loud
I'm hollering,
You won't let the truth come out.
So please calm down
Baby, because you're firing too high (too high)
Should I keep the truth inside?
So maybe it was better to lie,
Said it's better better,
I never should've let her know
It was better to lie.
