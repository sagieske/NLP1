Song:

I know what it takes to break you
You know I never sleep
Just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late
Close your eyes, walk with me, I set you free
And everything you ask for

I'll find a way and I return...
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day, would that change a thing?
You probably believe what you told them
Leave each moment like your last
Close your eyes, walk with me, I set you free
And everything you ask for

I'll find a way and I return...
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

I'll find a way and I return...
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

I'll find a way and I return...
I have to see those who do not know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight
