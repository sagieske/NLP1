Song:

And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Light of the world,
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly you came to the earth You created
All for loves sake became poor

So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved
Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved
Just call upon the name of the Lord and be saved
Call upon the name of the Lord and be saved

And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

So, here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

You're altogether lovely, and altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
You're altogether lovely, and altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
