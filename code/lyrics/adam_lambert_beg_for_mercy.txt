Song:

The stars collide
They fall to earth alive
As my hunger heights
Desires that are burning
Ready to land
I shall overcome
And when you're numb
A deeper breath comes out

Wo oh oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
I'll make you beg for mercy
Yeah eh eh
Come to settle the scar

The strenght inside
The lightning and the fun
I'll take in check
Won't hind it
In lightning you too under
The hard the post is racing towards a mine
Is every beat I found
Go trickling down the vile

I'll make you beg for mercy

We rule the sun
We rule the sun
Yeah eh eh
I'll make you beg for mercy
Come to settle the scar
Wo oh oh

My adrenaline is pumping
Yeah eh eh
I got it next to nothing
Wo oh oh
Come to settle the scar

I'll make you beg for mercy
Wo oh oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
Yeah eh eh
Come to settle the scar

Wo oh oh
I'll make you beg for mercy
We rule the sun
We rule the sun
I'll make you beg for mercy
We rule the sun
We rule the sun
