Song:

You were touched by love
You were touched by sin
It didn't matter to you
You still let me in
Chorus :
I live my life to be with you
I wanna live like lovers do
Yeah baby
Baby it's you
I'm alone here
While time flies by
I know that someday
You'll be by my side
Nothing's forever
Except you and me
We'll go on togheter
Cause you've all that i need
Chorus
From the first day i knew
It could only be you
Your world is pefection
My world is on fire
I can see my reflection
In the glow of your eyes
If you want me today
If you want me tonight
There's only one thing to do
Say, you're the one i desire
Chorus
