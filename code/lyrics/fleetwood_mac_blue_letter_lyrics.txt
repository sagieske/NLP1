Song:

Written by Richard and Michael Curtis.

It was a blue letter
She wrote to me
It's silver words she told
Wanna be on the road to paradise
I wanna lover who don't get old.

Do I read a message in your eyes
You wanna love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you.

For every voice you ever heard
There's a thousand without a word
Redbird, don't say you told me so,
Just give me one more song to go.

Do I read a message in your eyes
You wanna love to stay another night
Baby when your day goes down
I won't be waitin' around for you.
