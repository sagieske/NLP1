Song:

Blind man standing on the corner
Crying out the blues
He said I don't want a dollar
Don't you give me no dime
Until you bring back that little girl of mine

I can't let her go
I'm hooked
Lord I can't let her go

People try to tell me to stop trying
Find me somewhee new
Because when the good lord made one woman
Hellelujah don't you know he made two

But I can't let this one go
Lord I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Lord I can't let her go

He lifted his head towards the heaven
He said good lord I'd rather die
Than let a no good cheating woman
Make me stand on this corner and cry

He said lord knows I'm living in a world of darkness
He said but this don't bother me
And until I find that sweet little girl of mine
Lord knows I just don't want to see

But I can't ley her go no
I'm hooked
Lord I can't let her go
I can't ley her go
Lord I can't let her go
Won't somebody please help the blind man
Lord I can't let her go
Somebody help the blind man
I just can't let her go, - No
