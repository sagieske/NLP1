Song:

I Don't Want A Lot For Christmas
There's Just One Thing I Need
I Don't Care About Presents
Underneath The Christmas Tree
I Just Want You For My Own
More Than You Could Ever Know
Make My Wish Come True
All I Want For Christmas Is You.

I Don't Want A Lot For Christmas
There Is Just One Thing I Need
I Don't Care About Presents
Underneath The Christmas Tree
I Don't Need To Hang My Stocking
There Upon The Fireplace
Santa Claus Won't Make Me Happy
With A Toy On Christmas Day
I Just Want You For For My Own
More Than You Could Ever Know
Make My Wish Come True
All I Want For Christmas Is You
You Baby

I Won't Ask For Much This Christmas
I Won't Even Wish For Snow
I'm Just Gonna Keep On Waiting
Underneath The Mistletoe
I Won't Make A List And Send It
To The North Pole For Saint Nick
I Won't Even Stay Awake To
Hear Those Magic Reindeer Click
'Cause I Just Want You Here Tonight
Holding On To Me So Tight
What More Can I Do
Baby All I Want For Christmas Is You
You

All The Lights Are Shining
So Brightly Everywhere
And The Sound Of Children's
Laughter Fills The Air
And Everyone Is Singing
I Hear Those Sleigh Bells Ringing
Santa Won't You Bring Me The One I Really Need
Won't You Please Bring My Baby To Me

Oh, I Don't Want A Lot For Christmas
This Is All I'm Asking For
I Just Want To See My Baby
Standing Right Outside My Door
Oh I Just Want Him For My Own
More Than You Could Ever Know
Make My Wish Come True
Baby All I Want For Christmas Is
You

All I Want For Christmas Is You Baby
All I Want For Christmas Is You Baby
