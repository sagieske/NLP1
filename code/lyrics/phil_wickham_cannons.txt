Song:

It's falling from the Clouds
A strange and lovely sound
I hear it in the thunder and the rain
It's ringing in the skies like cannons in the night
The music of the Universe plays

We're singing you are
Holy, Great and Mighty
The moon and the stars
Declare who you are
And I'm so unworthy
But still You love me
Forever my heart will sing
Of how great you are

Beautiful and free
The song of galaxies
Reaching far beyond the milky way
Let's join in with sound
Come on let's sing it out
As the music of the universe plays

We're singing you are
Holy, Great and Mighty
The moon and the stars
Declare who you are
And I'm so unworthy
But still You love me
Forever my heart will sing
Of how great you are

All Glory honour power is yours Amen
All Glory honour power is yours Amen
All Glory honour power is yours Amen
All Glory honour power is yours forever Amen

You are
Holy, Great and Mighty
The moon and the stars
Declare who you are
And I'm so unworthy
But still You love me
Forever my heart will sing
Of how great you are

And you are
Holy, Great and Mighty
The moon and the stars
Declare who you are
And I'm so unworthy
But still You love me
Forever my heart will sing
Of how great you are
