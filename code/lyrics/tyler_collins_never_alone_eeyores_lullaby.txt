Song:

Lay your head, down to bed
Let your slumber sweep your cares away
In your dreams, chase moonbeams
All the way across the milky way

And as you rest in the nest
That we've made for you
We'll caress and keep you blessed
Never alone for the whole night through

Go to sleep, don't your weep
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be a brand-new day

And as you rest in the nest
That we've made for you
We'll caress and keep you blessed
Never alone for the whole night through

Go to sleep, don't you weep
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be a brand-new day
