Song:

Mamma's little Baby got busted, busted
Mamma's little Baby's goin down down down down

Down to the cell where Bubba crowns you queen
Where the floors are cold and the bunk's unclean
And the soft bellied white boy gets fucked 'til he screams

You were born with a different set of rules
You were raised in the Hood by cracked out fools
Now you're taking your guns and knives to school

Proving to your friends that you're so damn cool
Now you're attending a different school
You will obey Sgt. Zipperpigs every rule

I know you're not afraid boy
I've seen your silly games boy
I know that prison is hard on your hole
I know you're not afraid boy
I've seen your silly games boy
I know that prison is hard on your hole

Hole Hole Hole Hole Hole Hole Hole Hole

Mamma's little Baby got busted, busted
Mamma's little Baby's goin down down down down

Down to the cell where Bubba crowns you queen
Where the floors are cold and the bunk's unclean
And the soft bellied white boy gets fucked 'til he screams

When they beat you down like all the other fools
And you're sitting in a pile of your own bloody stool
Then maybe you'll think about obeying some rules
When you figure out that you can't being
And you're tired of being forced to act like a queen
Then you'll sit down and listen to the sound of the barbells cling

Listen to the Barbells cling
Listen to the Barbells cling
Listen to the Barbells cling
Listen to the Barbells cling
You can't be king
Listen to the Barbells
Listen to the Barbells
Listen to the Barbells cling
Listen to the Barbells

[Solo]

I know you're not afraid boy
I've seen your silly games boy
I know that prison is hard on your hole
I know you're not afraid boy
I've seen your silly games boy
I know that prison is hard on your hole

Hard on your hole [repeat]
Hole Hole
