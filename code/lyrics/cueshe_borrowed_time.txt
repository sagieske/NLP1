Song:

Every fight needs mending
Every start has an end
Like the sunrise and the sunset
That's just how it is
Love on borrowed time
Will never be yours nor mine
I need you like you need me
The way we ought to be

[Chorus]
Oh, it's good to be true,
If our hopes and dreams come true
Wish that I had more
Of this borrowed time
If only it would last a lifetime

This bitterness inside
Is an empty space I hide
It never satisfies
Living my life in a lie
Love on borrowed time
Will never be your nor mine
I'll just close my eyes
And it will be alright

[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge]

Now that you've gone away
You seems so close but you're
Miles and miles away

[Repeat chorus except last line]
[Repeat chorus]
