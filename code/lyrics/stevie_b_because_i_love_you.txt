Song:

I got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way I feel
To let you know my loves for real
Because I love you and I'll do anything
Ill give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide
If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
And that I'll always be around
Because I love you, my hearts an open door
Girl, wont you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide
If you should feel that I don't really care
And that you're starting to lose ground
Just let me reassure you that you can count on me
That I will always be around
Because I love you, my hearts an open door
Girl, wont you please come on in
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide
