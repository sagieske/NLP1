Song:

Our time, short and precious
Your lips, warm and luscious
You don't have to wear false charms
'Cause when I wrap you in my hungry arms
Be real black for me
Be real black for me

Your hair, soft and crinkly
Your body, strong and stately
You don't have to search and roam
'Cause I got your love at home
Be real black for me
Be real black for me

In my head I'm only half together
If I lose you, I'd be ruined forever
Darling, take my hand and hold me
Hold me (x4)

You know how much I need you
To have you, really feel you

You don't have to change a thing
No one knows the love you bring

Be real black for me
