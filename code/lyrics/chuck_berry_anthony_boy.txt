Song:

Eight o'clock in the morning
And I'm movin' on out to school
With an open book and a sleepy look
The teacher can't be fooled

I catch a pass in an early class
The teacher will never know
That I postponed my work at home
Watching the evening show

Hey, there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush?
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him he's a blush

Three o'clock in the afternoon
Completes a day of school
Before the ding can cease the ring
He's in the vestibule

Betty and Barbara and Jeanie and Jane
Are yackity-yackin' with Joan
About some things that Anthony
Told her over the telephone

Hey, there Tony boy
Why you in such a rush?
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him he's a blush

Hey, there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush?
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him how he blush

Betty told me the secret
That I had told her not to tell
Now that you know she knows I know
You know that all is well

Come, come Tony me boy
Now don't let 'em get in your hair
With a good education you may
Become a multi-millionaire

Hey, there Anthony boy
Why you in such a rush?
The girl she wanna talk to you
Look at him he's a blush
