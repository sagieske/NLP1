Song:

Oh baby, honey, please set a date
Baby, please set a date
Don't say tomorrow
Tomorrow might be too late

Oh baby, honey, please set a date
Baby, baby, please set a date
Oh, don't say tomorrow
Tomorrow might be too late

Yeah, when I need your loving, baby
I really need it, baby
When I get to you, baby
It really makes me mad

But, oh baby, baby, please set a date
Don't say tomorrow
Tomorrow might be too late

Yeah, when it's late on in the evening, baby
The sun is sinking low
When I see [Incomprehensible]
I don't know what to do

But, oh baby, baby, please set a date
Don't say tomorrow
Tomorrow might be too late

Oh baby, baby, please set a date
Baby, honey, please set a date
Don't say tomorrow
Tomorrow might be too late
