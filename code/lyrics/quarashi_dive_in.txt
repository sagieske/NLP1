Song:

Someday I will dive me in. Someday I will take a spin.
Someday I will make it right. Someday I will stop the fight.
It has been thought, it's been thought
I found a god that can teach. Take me along, once again on
That trip. Bring it on and when I'm gone, bite your lip. Is it to
Good to be secure? Maybe I should, I think I should find the
Cure. It's been thought before.
I found a god that can teach. Someday you will dive in.
Someday you will dive in. It's been thought before. It's been
Thought before.
