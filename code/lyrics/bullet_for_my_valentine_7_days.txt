Song:

Here it goes again!

What if, you always wait 'til you crave it?
Seven days to inconstitute you.
Nothing better.
You can't say no to this one thing.

You've had it all given to you.
F**k it!
If you want it, why don't you get it.
Better days will haunt you with nothing.
Why is it that you can't say no to this one thing?

You've had it all given to you.
You never had to work at all before.
I never meant it.
I never felt it.
I've never taken back a single word I've said.
I'll never take it back now.
I never meant it.
I'm never taking back a single word I said.

What if you always wait 'til you crave it?
Seven days to inconstitute you.
Nothing better.
You can't say no to this one thing.

You've had it all given to you.
F**k it!
If you want it, why don't you get it.
Better days will haunt you with nothing.
Why is it you just can't say no?

You've had it all given to you.
You never had to work at all before.
I never meant it.
I never felt it.
I've never taken back a single word I've said.
I'll never take it back now.
I never meant it.
I'm never taking back a single word I said.

(Guitar solo)

I never meant it.
I never felt it.
I've never takin' back a single word I've said.
I'll never take it back now.
I never meant it.
I'm never takin' back a single word I said.
