Song:

He's not a bad boy because he made me see
Ooo-ee, how love could be
But he's a bad boy because he wants to be free
He wants to be free

He's not a bad boy to look at, burnin' & fine
& he said he was mine
But he's a bad boy because it was only a line

I bragged to the girls about the boy I had
But it woke me up to find out he was bad
& my only wish is that I wish I could
Make a bad boy be good

He wasn't a bad boy at first, so good at the start
Right now, right now we must part
Yes, he's a bad boy, but he's breaking my heart
Oh oh he's breaking my my my my my heart
...& fade
