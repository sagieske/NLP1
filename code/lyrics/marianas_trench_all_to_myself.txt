Song:

I don't patronize
I realize
I'm losing and this is my real life
I'm half asleep
And I am wide awake
This habit is always so hard to break
I don't want to be the bad guy
I've been blaming myself and I think you know why
I'm killing time (I'm killing time),
And time's killing you every way that I do

Did you say
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

I'm under the gun
Feel like the only one
I just can't decide what I'm running from
This isn't what
I wanted but
I can't keep my filthy f*****g mouth shut
It's not enough (It's not enough) it's never enough
And I wish I could breath without getting it stuck
Can't focus it (Can't focus it) but I try it over and over again

Did you say
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

Na-na na-na na
Na-na na-na na-na
Na-na na-na na
Na-na na-na na-na

(Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like...)

Did you say
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I can't stay with someone else
I'll try and suck it up
I just can't f**k it up
I want you all to myself

Did you say
Please just follow me
I thought you wanted me
Cause I want you all to myself
I can try and suck it up
I just can't suck it up
Make me feel like someone else

Na-na na-na na!
