Song:

You learn a lot about a girl

The way that you meet her

Was she with a guy when you me her?

How did she treat him?

Was she lying to her man


To be out holding your hand
Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl





Do you really believe that with you

It will be different?

Man, listen to me I did that too

Now it's here that I'm missing


I'm a guy that she lied to
Soon enough that guy will be you



Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl

Was it a nice clean even split
Before you and she got into it?


Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl




Now here's a fact that is true
All men are dumb, all women are crazy

Hey, open your eyes



If you don't see this you're just being lazy
"Cause she's out with you
She's no saint as you can see
While she's living with me


Yeah, you learn a lot

Don't think you will not

Yeah, you learn a lot about a girl
