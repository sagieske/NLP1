Song:

Well, be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe

Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

She's the woman in the red blue jeans
She's the woman that's the queen of the teens
She's the one woman that I know
She's the one woman that loves me so

Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

She's the woman that's got that beat
She's the woman with the flying feet
She's the one woman that I know
She's the woman that loves me so

Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll

Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe
Be-bop-a-Lula, she's my baby
Be-bop-a-Lula, I don't mean maybe

Be bop a-Lula, she's my baby doll
My baby doll, my baby doll
