[Verse 1: Drake]
I'da kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama's house we argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Working all night traffic on the way home
And my Uncle callin' me like where you at?
I gave you the keys told you bring it right back
Nigga, I think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road half a million for a show
And we

[Verse 2: Drake]
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggle wasn't hungry yeah I doubt it nigga
I can turn your boy into the man
There aint really much out here that's poppin' off without us nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry bout me give a fuck about you
Nigga, just a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house
Cause we
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same I never changed it
No new niggas nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
Cause we
