Song:

Let's leave no words unspoken
Save regrets for the broken.
Will you even look back when you think of me?

I'm always screaming my lungs out
Till my head starts spinning.
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life.
Won't keep my voice down.
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud.

I like to keep things honest.
I'm a safe bet like your life's staked on it. For real.
I'd hate to keep you all wondering.
I'm constant like the seasons
I will never be forgotten man.

Let's leave no words unspoken
Save regrets for the broken.
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own,
And mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

Still got something left to prove.
It tends to keep things moving.
While everyone around me says my last days are looming overhead.
But what the hell do they think they know?
My head's above the water while they drown in the undertow.

Let's leave no words unspoken
Save regrets for the broken.
Will you even look back when you think of me?

All I want is a place to call my own,
And mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.
All I want is a place to call my own,
And mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

If you take it from me,
Live your life for yourself.
Cause when it's all said and done you don't need anyone else.
Come on!

So let's get back to when everything seemed perfect.
Not a worry in the world, tell me was it all worth it?
I get what I want, so everyone's always judging me.
I'm not afraid of anything
I've got the whole world in front of me.

All I want is a place to call my own,
And mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low
All I want is a place to call my own,
And mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
Whoa
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low

Keep your head down low.
Keep your head down low.
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low.
