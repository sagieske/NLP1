Song:

Gathering the horde on a mountain-side
Awaiting the morning bestial sunrise
Diabolic seven winds of hate
Breathe in the chasm of the realms
In clouds above horizon grey
A throne of ice
Watching silently with a warrior's eye

Winds of destruction fills our hearts
With joy portals to war lay before us
Fog in the distance is all I see
Born of the blackening sky of Blashyrkh
A raven's claws lifted towards the sky
Is a sign for the Norse hordes to ride
A sign for the Norse hordes to ride
Is the way for our enemies to die
