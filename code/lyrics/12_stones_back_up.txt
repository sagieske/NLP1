Song:

I hear the words you say to me
I see the way you look at me
I know what's on your mind so
Just stay away
Stand up get up back up now
I know what's weighing on your mind
I know the fear you hold inside


There's nothing you can do so
Stand up get up back up
But you've fallen short
You're reaching out just to be like me
You had the chance to bring me down
Still you're following me
So just stay away from me
But there's nothing left

There's nothing you can do but
You can't stand to see my face
Stand up get up back up now
To know you'll never take my place
Just stay away

I feel the hate you push on me
Stand up get up back up
I see the things that you can't see

I know what's on your mind so
It's not the things you say to me
You try to bring me down
It's not the things that I believe
So stand up get up back up now Just stay away
