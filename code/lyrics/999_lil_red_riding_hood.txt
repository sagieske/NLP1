Song:

Who's that I see walking in these woods
Why it's little red riding hood

Hey there little red riding hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want

Listen to me

Little red riding hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walking in spooky old woods alone

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
So just to see that you don't get chased
I think you 'ought to walk with me for a ways

What full lips you have
They're sure to lure someone bad
So until you get to grandma's place
I think you 'ought to walk with me and be safe

I'm gonna keep my sheep's suit on
Until I'm sure that you've been shown
That I can be trusted walking with you alone

Little red riding hood
I'd like to hold you if I could
But you might think that I'm a big bad wolf so I won't

What a big heart I have
All the better to love you with
Little red riding hood
Even bad wolves can be good

I'll try to keep you satisfied
Just to walk close by your side
Maybe you'll see things my way
Before we get to grandma's place

Little red riding hood
You sure are looking good
You're everything that a big bad wolf could want
I mean bad, bad, bad baaaaaad
