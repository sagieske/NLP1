Song:

Baby I can’t live without you I’m slowly dying

You leave, just me
These walls watching me bleed
I’m screaming, I’m hurting,
I’m begging you for mercy

[Bridge:]
Forgive me for the things I did, the things I said, if you understand
Forgive me and I’ll forgive you.

[Pre-Chorus:]
For playing my heart like a cello
Strumming me no longer, beating like a drummer
Oh, I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
Scared of what it feels like to be alone

[Chorus:]
Scared of what it feels like to miss you
Scared of what it feels like not to kiss you
Scared of what it feels like to be alone, yeah.
(You’re scared, you’re scared, you’re scared, you’re scared)

Know you, know me, it’s just the shadows I see
No savior, Hail Mary, who’s gonna rescue me?

[Bridge:]

[Pre-Chorus:]

[Chorus:]

Baby I can’t live without you I’m slowly dying
Baby without you I’m scared.

[Chorus:]
