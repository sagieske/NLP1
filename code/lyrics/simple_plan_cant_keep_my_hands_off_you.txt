Song:

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh... Let's go!

My fender strat sits all alone.
Collecting dust in the corner.
I haven't called any of my friends.
I've been mia since last December.
My blackberry's filled up with e-mail.
My phone calls goes straight through to voicemail.

Cause' on the street, or under the covers.
We're stuck like two pieces of velcro.
At the park, in the back of my car.
It don't matter what I do.
No, I can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
Can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)

There's fungus growing in the icebox.
All I got left are fruit roll-ups.
My clothes are six months old.
But I don't care, no no no I don't notice.
My bills pile's so high, it is shocking.
The repo man just keeps on knocking.

Cause' on the street, or under the covers.
We're stuck like two pieces of velcro.
At the park, in the back of my car.
It don't matter what I do,
No, I can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
Can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
Can't keep my hands off you!

Sorry to all my friends and to anyone I offend.
But I can't help it, no I can't help it.

Can't keep my, can't keep my.
(Can't keep my hands off)
Can't keep my, can't keep my. (can't keep my hands off)
Can't keep my, can't keep my. (I can't keep my hands off)
Can't keep my, can't keep my.

Cause' on the street, or under the covers.
We're stuck like two pieces of velcro.
At the park, in the back of my car.
It don't matter what I do,
No I can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
Can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
Can–í't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you!
(Can't keep my, can't keep my)
I can't keep my hands off you
