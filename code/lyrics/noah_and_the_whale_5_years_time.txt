Song:

Oh, well in 5 years time
We could be walking around a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there will be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes but you'll peek through

And there will be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there will be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun so what the heck

Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
Cause it's what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
And it was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
And it was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh, well I'll look at you and say it's the happiest I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel, I have to be James Dean
And she'll say yeah well I feel oh pretty happy too
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And it'll be love love love all through our minds
And it'll be love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

And though really all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking about them as I'm lying in bed
And I know that really it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm having a pretty good time with you

Oh in 5 years time I might not know you
In 5 years time we might not speak
In 5 years time we might not get along
In 5 years time you might just prove me wrong

Oh there will be love love love wherever you go
