Song:

Within a minute I was all packed up
I've got a ticket to another world
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
Suddenly words are hard to speak
When your thoughts are all I see
Don't ever leave, she said to me

When we both fall asleep, underneath the same sky
To the beats of our hearts at the same time
So close but so far away
(Can you hear me?)

[Chorus:]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you
She lies awake
Trying to find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you

Another day, and I'm somewhere new
I made a promise that I'll come home soon
Bring me back, bring me back to you

When we both wake up underneath the same sun
Time stops, I wish that I could rewind
So close but so far away
(Can you hear me?)

[Chorus:]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you
She lies awake
Trying to find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you

The pieces of us both
Under every city light
And the shining as we fade into the night

She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was

[Chorus:]
She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you
She lies awake
Trying to find the words to say
I wish I was, I wish I was
Beside you

Beside you
Beside you
Beside you

She sleeps alone
My heart wants to come home
I wish I was, I wish I was
