Words and music by glenn garrett and wayne tester

Sometimes I know, you can read my mind
Deep down inside where my fears are hiding
Whisper so tender the way that you do
There's a love that's forever I've found in you

I know sometimes, I ask you for the moon
Reach for a star and I long to hold you
How could this love be so simple for you
Then you reach out and touch me
And suddenly I see

[Chorus:]
All that I need is you
Always forever with you
I feel your love and I realize
All I ever need was you
Just you

You're all I ever needed

Once in a while a dream will come true
A moment in time created by you
Things less important start falling away
There's a truth down inside me
And I hear my heart

(repeat chorus)

I remember a time
Love was so hard to find
I was never really satisfied needing what I just denied
Oh, but now I see
So suddenly

(repeat chorus)
