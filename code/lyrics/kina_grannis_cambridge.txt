Song:

Just give it to me quick
Are you coming home?
Don't dance around it

I need to hear this
I chose you long ago
Have you chosen me yet?

'Cause I'm starting to wear thin, find it harder to forgive
Every time you let us slip down your list of priorities

I'm waiting for you to finally say you are here and here to stay
But darling, if you know that it's through
You can't keep doing what you do
Is it time to let go of you

Now please don't take this wrong
You know I want you
But don't think I won't move on

'Cause I'm starting to wear thin, find it harder to forgive
Every time you let us slip down your list of priorities

I'm waiting for you to finally say you are here and here to stay
But darling, if you know that it's through
You can't keep doing what you do
Is it time to let go of you

You once whispered words to me
Wondering if anybody loved each other like we do

I'm waiting for you to finally say you are here and here to stay
But darling, if you know that it's through
You can't keep doing what you do
Is it time to let go of you
Time to let go of you
Time to let go of you
