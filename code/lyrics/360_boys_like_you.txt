Song:

Oi, I mean it, I mean it, I ain't trying to play around
I need it, I need it, you can probably see it
You'll probably think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets, and hit it up and leave it
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say my reputation precedes me
But you gotta be fair
Though you might've heard about the numbers that I sleep with
That's not all I am but at least there ain't no secrets

Mama always told me poppa always warned me don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty don't mess around with boys like
You
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

Ay yo you've heard about me right
You've known that my rep's renowned
Your friends will tell you stay away because I've slept around
That's how it works though, the word will get around
Back in the day it didn't faze me though
But lately it has kept me down
And though I brought it on myself
But I ain't mad about it
I kept count, but why the f**k did I brag about it
But I'll admit it though my rep is deserved
But I'll be real I want to kill it, though cause having that rep is a curse
My last girl cheated on me with a close friend
That's two relationships, I had to watch them both end
But see it messed with me, the two people I trusted most
I could shrug it off on drunkenness, but f**k them both
See that switched something inside of me
A beast came alive in me and started just eating away the pride in me
Because we're known to make mistakes and I've grown to make a change
I was different back then but now I ain't the same

Mama always told me poppa always warned me don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty don't mess around with boys like
You
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you

I mean it, I mean it, I ain't trying to play around
I need it, I need it, you can probably see it
You'll probably think I'm gonna rip your heart to pieces
Get you in the sheets and hit it up and leave it
Believe it, believe me, you are gonna say my reputation precedes it
But you gotta be fair
Through you might've heard about the numbers that I sleep with
Yeah that may be true but it's you I wanna be with

Mama always told me poppa always warned me don't hang around boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty don't mess around with boys like
You
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position
If I had have listened wouldn't be in this position with you
