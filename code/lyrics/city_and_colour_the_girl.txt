Song:

I wish I could do better by you
Cuz that's what you deserve.
You sacrifice so much of your life
In order for this to work.

While I'm off chasing my own dreams,
Sailing around the world,
Please know that I'm yours to keep,
My beautiful girl.

When you cry a piece of my heart dies,
Knowing that I may have been the cause.
If you were to leave,
Fulfill someone else's dreams,
I think I might totally be lost.

You don't ask for no diamond rings,
No delicate strings of pearls,
That's why I wrote this song to sing,
My beautiful girl.
