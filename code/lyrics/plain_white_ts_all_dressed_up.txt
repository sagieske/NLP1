Song:

Well, I'm all dressed up, and i got no place to go.
My friends don't answer when i call them on the phone.
And i got no car, so i am stuck at home.
Till someone picks me up, i will be all alone.
And my heart is breaking, and my back is aching.
And i know you wanna be there for me.
I know that you're the ride i need.
But you won't come over,
'cause you think it's over.
You might just be right here.

But i'm all dressed up, and i wanna hit the town.
The lights are shinning as bright when i'm not around.
So, if you get my call and you're in the neighborhood,
Stop by and say goodbye and do us both some good.

And my heart is breaking, and my back is aching.
And i know you wanna be there for me.
I know that you're the ride i need.
But you won't come over,
'cause you think it's over.
You might just be right here.

But i'm all dressed up.

Well, i'm all dressed up, and i have no place to go.
My friends don't answer when i call them on the phone.
And i got no car, so i guess i'm stuck at home.
Till someone picks me up, i will be all alone.

And my heart is breaking, and my back is aching.
And my hands are shaking, this is my life in the making.
And i know you wanna be there for me.
I know that you're the ride i need.
But you won't come over,
'cause you think it's over.
You might just be right here.

And i know you wanna be there for me.
You know that you're the ride i need.
But you won't come over,
Because you think it's over.
You might just be right here.

But i'm all dressed up.
