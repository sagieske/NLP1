Song:

It all comes back
To the fact I don't ever love enough
Because I'm just ports lacking hard, as if that were ever good enough
So lets not be vague, we're all a little f-f-fr-freaked out these days
So give me one drink and a tune, and 20 minutes of you and the hope I just want to feel good tonight

Just a little bit, Just a little bit, just a little bit slower now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit harder now

We've gotta study together now
There is so much more to being young these days
15 and falling in love
You're far to young to be versed in such grown up ways
You're playing to hand touch, way to much
It's the only crush that will make me blush
You're playing two hand touch, way to much
It's the only crush

Just a little bit, Just a little bit, just a little bit, slower now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit harder now

Just a little bit, Just a little bit, Just a little bit, softer now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit slower now

Just a little bit, Just a little bit harder now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit harder now

(Oooooo)

Just a little bit, Just a little bit, just a little bit slower now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit harder now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit, just a little bit softer now
Just a little bit, Just a little bit slower now

(I just want to feel good tonight)x3
(I just want to feel I just wanna feel...)
