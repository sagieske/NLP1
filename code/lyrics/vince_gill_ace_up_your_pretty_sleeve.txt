Song:

I take it out on you
I take it out on me
Don't take to a cruel world very gracefully
I'm the cause and effect
My own four-letter words
Baby I'm a good man
No matter what you heard

And I'll be there for you
When you need me to be
I'll be the sun at your door
I'll be the wind in your trees
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve
Oh yes I will

I'm sharp with my tongue
I know I cut you inside
But I make a concerted effort at times
To try to be more
Than a fool in your eyes
Baby I love you
Don't you realize

And I'll be there for you
When you need me to be
I'll be the sun at your door
I'll be the wind in your trees
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve
Oh up your pretty sleeve baby

And I'll be there for you
When you need me to be
I'll be the sun at your door
I'll be the wind in your trees
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve
If I've nothin' at all on the surface to see
I'll be the ace up your pretty sleeve
