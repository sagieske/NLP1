Song:

I met a girl in east la
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eigths in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court

La la la la la la la (x6)

I don't sp-
I don't sp-

Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo
Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo

Mis canciones son de la revolucion
Mi corazуn me duele por mi generaciуn
If you love me, we can marry on the west coast
On a wednesday, en un verano en agosto

I don't speak your, I don't speak your
Languagono (La la la la la la la)
I don't speak your, I won't speak your
Jesus Cristo (La la la la la la la)

Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo
Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo

I will fight for, I have fought for
How I love you
I have cried for, I will die for
How I care
In the mountains, las campanas
Estбn sonando
Todos los chicos (chicas)
Y los chicos (chicas) estбn besando

I don't speak your, I don't speak your
Languagono
I don't speak your, I won't speak your
Jesus Cristo
I don't speak your, I don't speak your
Americano
I don't speak your, I won't speak your
Jesus Cristo

Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo
Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo
Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo
Ahhhhh-americaaaa americanoooo

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to catch me
No no no no
I'm living on the edge of
Living on the edge of the
Law law law law

Don't you try to catch me
Don't you try to get me
No no no no
Don't you try to catch me
I'm living on the edge of the
Law law law law
