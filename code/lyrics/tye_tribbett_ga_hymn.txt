Song:

Who is He who answers when I call?
Who is there in the time of need?
And when I get weak who gives me His strength?
Who else but God, who else but God

Who has power beyond what eyes can see?
Who orders the wind blow and rivers flow?
So great and mighty, yet still cares for me
Who else but God, who else but God

Now who is He who keeps my mind at ease?
And who gives me praise for heaviness?, and
For ashes, who gives beauty?
Who else but God, who else but God

Now who is He who always makes a way?
Who's the one who never fails?
And in my trouble, who's my present help?
Who else but God, who else but God

(Chorus)

No one else can do the things You do
You are holy
That's why I will always worship You
You are holy

Who is He who gives health to my flesh?
Who allows my eyes to see?
And who'll be there when everyone else leaves?
Who else but God, who else but God

Now who's the one who died on Calvary?
And on day three rose again
And by His blood I've been redeemed
Who else but God, who else but God

(Chorus)

Who deserves the glory that is due?
And who should I give all my praise?
And when I give thanks'
Where should it go to?
Who else but God, who else but God

Oh God (Who has blessed me, (God) inspite of my ways? (God) Who has given me His favor?)
Oh God (Who loves me even more than myself?)
Who else but God, who else but God
